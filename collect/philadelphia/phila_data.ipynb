Our waitress came over and gave us menus and our friend ordered an app right away and we ordered drinks. Naturally you'd think the drinks would come out first, i saw them sitting on the bar, but the server waited 25 minutes until the food came out. We had decided about five minutes after we ordered the drinks what we wanted to eat but our server didnt come back over til she brought those apps. I actually had to call after her when she set them down because she didnt ask if we wanted anything else. Our food took forever to come out then and a food runner brought it and forgot part of the meal. The food runner ran off quickly before we could say anything and again we didnt see or waitress for another 25 minutes to tell her we were missing part of her meal. By the time it came out, trivia was over and we were ready to leave. I could tell our server didnt even have many tables, as it wasnt that packed. Trivia was bad, service was bad,  drinks were poorly made, and the food was overpriced for what we got. Overall awful experience that was supposed to be a good birthday night.\",\n",

I asked her if she was sure that they didn\\'t have since I called ahead of time and she said no we do not do that here. I was getting ready to leave and she \"went to check\" (literally walked away for 0.2 micro seconds and came back to the bar and gave me the menu which was next to her POS). I understand that the kitchen was closing at 11 and I got there after 10 pm, but customer service shouldn\\'t have been this horrible--especially since I was ordering take out.
