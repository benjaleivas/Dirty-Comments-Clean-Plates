Yes,Bright Spot Cafe,4.0,60.0,0.0,"[""Stopped in after hearing great things about this cafe.  I run a local business and thought I would try it out for future catering opportunities.  I ordered the Keto skillet which was good.  My son ordered the chicken and waffles which was not good.  The chicken was tough and the waffle had a weird smoky flavor.  After much pleading  (from me, he didn't want to say anything) he ordered something else and the nice waitress took it away.  He ordered just a plain waffle to replace it.  Much to my surprise we were still charged for the chicken and waffle dish.  I felt that if that was the case we should have been offered to take it home (which we would have declined.  My husband got French toast to go and he said it was ok.  So the way I figured it they needed the 13.00 More than I did.  I tipped the super nice server well and crossed it off my catering list.

You get three large pieces of brioche slathered in Nutella, powdered sugar and bananas. Syrup comes on the side but it is certainly not needed. I also ordered the cauliflower tots on the side which were great, especially if you\'re looking for lower carb options. Tastes exactly like home fries without the extra carbs. \n\nMy husband ordered the ""Big B"" burger which was also excellent. Sweet and tangy slaw on top of tender brisket and a 1/2 pound burger. He was a big fan. \n\nThe only thing I will say is that some items may not be available due to a menu revamp, but the staff is willing to work with you and make sure you are happy.

Be forewarned- the pancakes were literally the size of the plate.

Probably a strange thing to note, but the bacon was nearly transcendent. It was thick cut, delicious, and cooked to the perfect degree between chewy and crispy.

My state inspection failed and I was told it would be a little over $1000 for them to pass it after the repairs. I declined and brought it to my trustworthy mechanic (whom I didn\'t go to in the first place because of Scott\'s ""free"" state inspection). I told him what Scott failed me for and he had a look for himself. He did find some things wrong but the price was more then half of the amount Scott Honda wanted to charge. I called to let Scott know this and the disappointment I had in them. I was told my mechanic used after market parts on my car that\'s why it was so much cheaper. Really? Honda parts are over $500 more then the parts my trustworthy mechanic uses whom I\'ve used for ten years prior to giving Scott a chance. Every part he has used for my previous car has held up so either Honda parts are way over priced or Scott is over priced.

The interior of the ice cream shop was beautiful and the exterior was just as nice - we sat outside admiring the view of the farm. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the young kid that served us seemed new and the size of the scoops he gave us were so different to the point they didn't make any sense. We all got 1 scoop and my 3 year old daughter got a massive scoop, but mine was so tiny you could eat it in 2 bites.

I ended up getting a sundae with pineapple orange ice cream and mango topping. I loved that they have mango topping since that's unusual.

Instead of removing both entrees, the server left the correct entree, returning to the kitchen to put in the order for the second entrée. Here was the issue: the correct entrée became cold while awaiting the preparation and delivery of the second entrée. To make matters worse, both entrees were disappointing. The portions were small, especially considering the high prices. The risotto was nothing special, and the ravioli was poorly seasoned, thick and gummy with little flavor. \nThe ambient noise in this closed space kept increasing as the evening progressed. There was live entertainment in the adjacent bar area that was too loud for the relatively small space. As a result, the noise level was more in line with that of a sports bar than a country inn.

I guess they must be doing something right when we realized that they've got like 16 locations.  This one is in a beautifully restored old building in the heart of what appears to be the main strip of Phoenixville - Bridge Street.\n\nOur server said that some of the beers being served are brewed on site while others are brewed at some of their other locations.  In any event, they had more than a dozen brews on tap so we each decided to try a flight - four, 4 oz. tastes ($6).  I was disappointed to not find many dark beers available.  The only one listed was their Pig Iron Porter, so I chose that one along with some non-IPAs, a Pennypacker Pilsner, an Iron Hill Light Lager, and a Vienna Red Lager.  The Iron Hill Light, while being a light variety, was very refreshing with enough flavor to know it was a beer.  The pilsner was a bit more flavorful than the light, but nothing special.  The Vienna Red was just OK.  The Porter had some good flavor notes, but seemed watery.\n\nMy wife tried the Lupulin Blast IPA, a Witberry Belgian wheat, a Saison farmhouse ale, and an Ore House IPA.  She enjoyed them all and was pleased that the Witberry was not overly fruity.\n\nWe decided to try one of their Hearth Baked Pizzas as an appetizer - Spicy Hawaiian Pig ($15) topped with bacon, andouille sausage, pepperoni, pineapple, Serrano chilies, mozzarella, and a sriracha tomato sauce.  (It was as close to a custom Steve N. version as possible.) While the dough was thin and looked like a cracker, it had enough flexibility and thickness at the edges that it did not taste like a cracker.  In fact, it had a good flavor and chewiness.  The toppings were an excellent mix of flavors, textures, sweetness, and spiciness.\n\nFor our main course my wife ordered the Naked Burger Salad ($15.50) - basically a deconstructed burger.  The burger was grilled the requested medium-rare and served on top of romaine, iceberg, bacon, gorgonzola, grape tomatoes, onion, and matchstick potatoes with a creamy blue cheese dressing.  A nice idea since you got to try any of the ingredients separately or in combination with any or all of the others.\n\nI opted to try a Zeus Burger ($15) - a mix of both lamb and beef with thin sliced cucumber, red onion, feta cheese aioli, and green herb sauce all served on a potato roll.  This was really tasty, especially with the flavor of cucumber, the herb sauce and the aioli.  I'm just not certain that they blended the ground lamb and beef thoroughly.  Not only did one side of the patty look more like the requested medium-rare while the other side looked more like medium-well, but there was more lamb flavor in some bites than other bites.  Otherwise, it was really tasty.  The substituted Sweet Potato Fries ($3) were thickly cut and not really crispy on the outside.\n\nOverall, service was friendly, fast and informative.  I would have no problem visiting another of their locations. I just wish they had more dark beers."", 'Always consistently good and they have a few beers I love.  Bar service regularly out performs the dining room.', 'My family and I have been coming here for years and had a very negative experience this evening. While waiting with another family for a table to open in the bar area, a woman cut in front of us and took the next available table. It was quite obvious that multiple families were waiting. When approached, she became rude and proceeded to threaten myself and the other family. This behavior was embarrassing for her, classless and socially unacceptable. We ended up leaving and going to a nearby restaurant.

There is a lot of breweries nowadays with various atrisanal beer concoctions but here the beer was a compliment to the food that is being served in the restaurant, which is exactly how it should be.\n\nWe came in with 4 small kids but it was fairly early so no rush yet.  Kids decided that they wanted fries, burgers and chicken fingers, so as soon as they got them they were happy and bouncing around.\n\nThe adults decided that we should just get burgers.  So we got burgers, and unlike most places similar to the Iron Hill the burgers usually came out overdone.  Not this time.  This time they were perfect with seasoning and Blue cheese crumble.

The back (beer garden-but couldn't see an outdoor space) was rented out for a kids (?) party, so I didn't see much other than pinball games, air hockey, etc.  The variety of beers was good with something for everyone on our group.

He knew their beers, asked about my preferences, and made suggestions. The beer was very good as well. I did not try the food so I cannot comment on that. \n\nOverall, the theme of the brewery would not have been my choice, but it was not overpowering and I was comfortable there. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The beer was very good. I would certainly stop by again if I was in the area.\n\nPs- they appear to have different events. Including drone racing through the bar.

It's a huge space with lots of seating and a large game room in the back. We came on a Saturday night, and there was plenty of seating left.\n\nThey were out of tortilla chips. The chicken tacos were good, but the short rib tacos tasted unseasoned. I didn't eat the Reuben sandwich, but it looked a little thin on ingredients. I was told it was good, though (by someone I was with). The tacos were expensive ($9) since you only get two. They were only 6 inch tortillas, and they weren't overflowing with ingredients. I think I ate mine in 3 or 4 big bites. \n\nThe beers were pretty average. I had the Flavor Clouds DIPA and tasted the Grit Lager. They tasted like your standard DIPA and lager. The flavor wasn't distinct at all."", ""Stopped in during Blobfest and was very impressed.

Yes,Applebee's Grill + Bar,3.5,44.0,1.0,"[""I have been to this location multiple times and actually used to come in once a week with coworkers when Tyler was still a manager at the location, but I have not come in 4 months. I have never had any issues with them before. NEVER BEFORE HAS ANY ESTABLISHMENT (INCLUDING THIS ONE) TAKEN MY ID TO A PLACE THAT I CANNOT SEE IT AND HAD IT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. This is a safety concern in regards to identity theft. And I am 27 years old so its not like it my first or second time at the rodeo.\n\nHowever, on my last encounter I sit at the bar and ask for the cranberry lemonade vodka. The bartender Moira M asks me for my id which I did not have a problem with. She stands there looks at my id for at least a full minute if not too and then tells me she will be back, and it completely slips my mind that she had not given me back my id so I look on the bar as I was sure she must have placed it down without me seeing. NOPE! She had took my id with her. Well 5 minutes roll around and there is still no Moira, so I walk over to the hostess stand and ask the hostess if she can please go and bring the manager out for me. \n\nThe bartender, Moira, finally shows up instead with no manager and tells me sorry I have to check all out of state ids. I asked her and it took that long for you to check it, don't you just scan the id and why did you have to walk away from me to do it? I then just asked her to bring out the manager. Steve Barnes is brought out in which case I asked him why she walked away with my id and he told me that she has to check all vertical or out of state ids with some book that they have. I was first a bit perplexed as I have a MD license...the MD border is less than 45 minutes from the location and would think they should know what a MD, DE, NJ, and PA license look like. I asked him why she had to take it to the back to check it and why she could not have brought the book out. He stated they could have, but did not. So I asked Steve for CORPORATE's number and he instead gives me the number for the franchise (The Rose Group) Area Manager, Dina Morgan. So I looked up corporates number and lodged a complaint with them as well as leaving a voicemail for Dina Morgan right on the spot.\n\nAfter finally being able to speak with Dina, who compared disappearing with an id as equivalent to disappearing with a credit card and someone taking the numbers off of that to buy product online, I have come to the conclusion that I have never ran into such an ignorant bunch. I have had my credit card information taken before, its an inconvenience because I do not enjoy having to make extended phone calls, but was taken care of immediately and was a minor inconvenience. I have spoken to someone who has had their identity stolen and it is a LONG and tedious process in which actually sparked me to subscribe to a service to monitor it. I tried to explain the difference to her, yet she seemed to feel she was completely correct. Here is an article explaining the difference in case those do not know \nhttps://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/credit-fraud-vs-identity-theft-whats-the-difference\n\nI expressed to Dina my concern as the bartender was gone for so long I had no clue what she was doing with my id, she could have been copying down my DL number or actually making a copy of my id (which is illegal), someone else could have been doing it, or she could have been doing nothing. I would have known exactly what they were doing if they'd handed my id back to me and went and brought the book to do it in front of me. She told me it was Applebees policy, and I later had her clarify it was not Applebees' policy, but apparently the Rose Group policy. Either way I told her Applebees, The Rose Group, herself, etc was assuming liability if identity theft was to ensue (which could take years to come about) when they clearly did not have to. On top of that friends, coworkers, and family that I have spoken with have said that they were completely turned off by this policy and never had anything like this happen to them. \n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry in college, as well as the hospitality industry doing bottle service at clubs in Miami, and cocktail waitressing at Hard Rock Casino and MGM, I have never seen a policy like this before probably because most establishments do not want to assume the liability for it if something were to ensue. I understand wanting to ensure that you are not serving minors, but if you have such a hard time identifying illegitimate identification cards, you should probably just invest in an id scanner which validates the barcode.""]",[1.0],1,1.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He did proceed to wash them so I'll give him credit for that but really no need to fix his hair in the same area where the donuts are made. Then the second guy who handles mixing the donut dough felt he needed to fix his hair. He felt it wasn't necessary to wash his hands. Then proceeded to go about his job if making the batter.

Recommended appetizers include the burrata (a cool take on this classic with pickled beets and arugula) and the duck fat friend chicken wings (wow).\n\nThe pastas (pappardelle with braised beef, or the rigatoni with lamb merguez) are made in house and are perfect. Recommended mains include the pomegranate glazed eggplant, and the grilled half-chicken which has a really incredible crisp and is moist, not at all dry (I hate most chicken dishes and love this one).', ""Chef Feury and his team from Nectar have opened another great restaurant which I hope stays around for a long time.\n\nThe artichoke dish with hummus was a delicious start to the meal, and the burrata is the best I've eaten.\n\nWe went with the chicken dish, a couple pastas (lamb pappardelle) and the shrimp tempura sandwich. Everything was delicious, and so were the desserts. The interior is beautiful also, and the ambiance was really nice for University City.\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone who likes New American cuisine with a flare."", ""We were invited by our awesome neighbors to a Friends and Family soft opening for The Common PHL, involving a 3 course tasting app/entree/dessert tasting.\n\nWe were four adventurous eaters, so were able to sample most of the enticing menu:\n\nAppetizers: \n* House Made Burrata: pickled beets, red peppers, arugula, pistachio.\n* Crispy Artichokes: hummus and crispy chickpeas, tehina, and herbs\n* Hamachi Crudo: persimmon, olive oil, citrus, pomegranate, fresno chili\n* Fuji Apples and baby greens: pepito, curried pepitas, pickled squash, maple vinaigrette\n\n(I really liked the crispy artichokes and the hamachi crudo, but the burrata and greens would be perfect for the warmer months!)\n\nEntrees:\n* Grilled Giannone half chicken: vegetable panzanella, lemon paprika jus\n* Tempura Shrimp on Ciabatta: sauce gribiche, fried pickle and capers\n* Tamarind Glazed Spare Ribs: refried lentils, braised red cabbage\n* Pan-Roasted Wild Striped Bass: cannelini beans, mushrooms, red peppers, olive tapenade\n\n(We made our own surf and turfs, and the chicken and fish were outstanding! Wish we could have tried the Rigatoni with lamb merguez.)\n\nDessert:\n* Pound Cake and Ice Cream.  They ran out of the other option, but I'm sure it was equally delicious!\n\nOf note: the power went out for about 1.5 hours early in the evening service! We got a bit worried as none of our plates came out yet, but saw that the kitchen didn't flinch and kept pushing out plates. All of the staff powered through, didn't miss a beat, and kept up with the great service!\n\nIt's always challenging to open a new spot in the winter, but I certainly hope this new concept does well with potential happy hour programming (eventually lunch?) and a great corner location at 36th and Market: near the 34th St. subway, University Science Center, Drexel, UPenn, and the various hospitals and offices nearby.\n\nhttp://www.philly.com/food/the-common-danlu-italian-market-lucio-palazzo-20181228.html"", 'This will become one of my favorite stops. The staff is VERY friendly. Food is amazing and the dining room is aesthetically pleasing. Prices are reasonable. Perfect lunch stop!', ""1. I am deeply saddened they switched over from Danlu. My buddies and I loved their spiked bubble tea. \n\n2. Had a turbulent experience with my first time at The Commons, and I share this because I want to make it a point that management (Travis, Henry, and Geoff) all collectively went above and beyond to rectify the situation. And for that, I am thankful. \n!\nI initially came down with my coworkers for happy hour, so we did not get too much for the table but I was able to snag some takeout to bring home as a real meal for my boyfriend and I. \n\nThe mushroom farro risotto is a must have, if you like mushrooms, goat cheese, farro, and dill. The dill is such an ingenious touch. \n\nI am no bread expert, but I really enjoy their focaccia and I cannot describe why. I  usually do not eat bread like this, but my boss ordered one for the table and I ordered smother to take home. So for what it is worth, I essentially got seconds. \n\nThe braised beef pappardelle is also very tasty.  It's a rather small portion, yet just the right amount of food. \n\nI am excited to have a new place to frequent in the UC neighborhood!"", ""Wow!  I had the Apple Salad, and it was the best salad I've ever had in my life!  An amazing blend of micro-green flavors, apple, nut, spinach and feta, with an amazing orange dressing.\n\nNext I had the eggplant sandwich which was stuffed with mushrooms, onions and peppers with a nice slab of mozzarella, and a mound of fries.  The perfect vegetarian option!\n\nThis place ROCKS!  So good!  I'm coming back."", 'Cool space. We pigged out. Burrata, wings, spare ribs, salmon.

I can't get enough of the Sunchoke Soup, fresh pastas & The burger is seriously by far the best in Philly! \nThe decor and atmosphere feels sexy yet casual in a modern way. I really love the neon art on the second floor and the floor to ceiling mural by the staircase is stunning. Even the bathroom is a work of art. \n5 Stars!!!!"", ""Called in for lunch. We started with the mushroom farro 'risotto': very good. Good quality flavorful mushrooms, great creamy texture.\n\nFollowed by the beef pappardelle and 'caesar' salad. Again, great flavors, just right portion sizes. Nothing totally exceptional, but very solidly executed new american.\n\nFinished with the donuts. Service on this was slow and it generally missed the mark: the lingonberry dipping sauce wasn't the right flavor and too thin for dipping. Cappuccino was perfectly adequate. Drank a beer with the appetizer and main course: a nice sour, and generally a strong draft list.\n\nThere are definitely still kinks to work out on a few menu items and with service overall, but I think there were some real bright spots on the menu and the pricing was very competitive: it's really refreshing to see solid lunch options under ten dollars, and for that I can definitely forgive a few missteps, especially in the first few weeks of service."", ""If you're looking for a lunch option in University City, I'd say that The Common is a definite go-to. Their lunch menu is comparable to their dinner one, but at midday meal-appropriate, wallet-friendly prices! They have large portions for lunch, and the food is delicious. Hence, I'd say you might have leftovers, but let's be real -- you probably won't. Their fries are the best: they're the skinny, crispy kind with soft insides. And they make their pastas in-house. YUM.\n\nI've also frequented The Common for happy hour, and I enjoy their deals oh-so-much, especially the duck fat-fried chicken wings and their $5 wine. They used to have a lovely Moscato on the HH menu, but now I think it's just Chardonnay and Savignon Blanc, which is quite OK, don't get me wrong, but it was awesome having a sweeter option. They've also got deals on red wine, beer, and cocktails. Take your pick!\n\nThe dinners I've had here have been, perhaps, the reason why this isn't a 5-star review. The service has been friendly but spotty, and if the lunch portions are large, I'd say that the dinner portions are little... yet they pack a punch in terms of $$$, even if you overlap a bit with happy hour (i.e., we've had meals where we'd have HH apps and drinks and dinner entrees).\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a top contender for lunch and happy hour, but not top of my list for dinner."", 'Similar atmosphere as Danlu, a few more communal tables.  Good place for solo-diners if you are okay with being forgotten by the wait staff, $5 wine, and 3-star quality food.', ""This place is A+. I eat here at least once a week. Relaxed ambiance, friendly service, great cocktails to welcome you. The half-chicken is delightful - crisp with the right blend of salt and spice on the outside, juicy and flavorful inside. The burger is one of their most popular and justly so - the (not too) spicy Korean sauce and the cheese are really an expert blend. Duck fat friend chicken wings are worth a visit all by themselves, and the pastas are hearty - very solid. Wouldn't recommend the salmon, but it's the only real miss on the menu for me.\n\nOverall, this is just a great neighborhood restaurant that does all the important things really right."", ""This place is my new favorite!! I live close by and I go in often. Yesterday I brought my mom and aunt who are both VERY picky eaters and they were very impressed. EVERYTHING is delicious! \n\nWe had the chicken wings, the steak entree, shrimp tempura sandwich and I had a special which was soft shell crab. DELICIOUS!!! And we ordered desserts. Don't let the menu intimidate you, just try something. It'll be delicious for sure"", ""A new restaurant with an excellent and price-competitive lunch menu!! \n\nI usually don't write reviews but felt like this one needed a hand in getting its name out there. The first time I dined here for lunch, I got the roast pork sandwich and wasn't impressed. I was quite turned off by the sauce, felt like it was too sharp for the sandwich. My friend ordered the pappardelle and it looked so good that I ended up eating some off of his plate. I did not regret my primitive behavior as it was delicious. This was what categorized The Common in my mind as a place to give a second chance to. \n\nToday, I was in the mood for a quality yet inexpensive lunch again. There are at least 5 entrees available for under $10! So, off I went to the Common. This time, I made the right choice and ordered the chicken milanesa with salad. Each bite was absolutely decadent. My only complaint was that the sauce was not spread evenly in the sandwich which caused it to ooze out one side while I was eating. The salad was fresh and paired well with the vinaigrette. \n\nOverall, great place to have a peaceful lunch with enough left over for dinner!"", ""Randomly popped in here with my GF since we were in the neighborhood. Usually don't like specialty cocktails but their take on the old fashioned is surprisingly good. Duck fat wings are great too.

Today I finally got to check it out w/ my friend. \n\nWe love their decor, looks really nice. \n\nWe ordered one appetizer, grilled octopus. I got the beef pasta, my friend had the tempura sandwich. They were really good. We loved them."", 'Quite by accident, I found myself looking for a place for dinner near Drexel.  My girlfriend had come down to meet me after working late and we came across this place called The Common on Market Street so we decided to give it a go.  \n\nWe got a couple of glasses of wine and started to order appetizers from the menu.  The waiter suggested the grilled octopus to my girlfriend and I ordered the crispy artichoke. Both were very generous portions.  The artichoke dish was a contrast of deep-fried relatively small (but plentiful) sweet and warm artichokes over some cool hummus. And her appetizer was plated like a presentation of gold bracelets at a fancy jewelry store.  I had to take a photo. \n\nOur entrees were equally tasty with my girl ordering the hot and spicy spaghettini with assorted   seafood and I wanted the hearty spare ribs.  The ribs were like the ones I had gotten on trips to the Southwest, fall off the bone, while her pasta dish was so hot that she asked for something cool for dessert.  \n\nWe shared the unusual semolina and pistachio cake which came with a very cool goat milk-rosemary gelato topping, yum. \n\nWhile the restaurant seemed a little empty the waiter said that it was new and that it used to be a Taiwanese place and the locals hadn\'t yet gotten the word out.  So, he ended with ""tell your friends"".

I came on a Monday night with my boyfriend for Center City Restaurant Week, and the place was packed. We were seated very quickly (we had a reservation). For the first course, we had Aged Manchego Cheese with truffle lavender honey, Chorizo Blanco, Tortilla Española, and Gambas Al Ajillo. For the second course, we had Coca de Alcachofas Y Setas, A La Plancha: Hanger Steak, Arroz Temporado, and Madre E Hijo,. We both got Tocinillo de Cielo for dessert.

Around the 15 min. mark, we began to wonder who our waiter/waitress was and it turned out to be the woman who offered us the water. She had not introduced herself. Once she took our orders, she was more attentive to our table. We had the garlic shrimp, crab stuffed peppers and lobster paella. Each dish was simply divine. Additionally we ordered one round of drinks and dessert.', 'Came here last Thursday for restaurant week.  Good for drinks.  The tapas were savory and very flavorful.  Recommend bringing a few people so that you can share the dishes among the party and try a wider variety of the menu.  Although the portions on most items were okay in size, I thought the pepper stuffed with crab meat was a little chancy.  We did not care for the desserts that were offered.  One was completely sour, which is why I could not give this restaurant five stars.  So come for the drinks and tapas but skip dessert.', ""I went here with a large group of people. They accommodated us with a large room in the back of the restaurant which was very convenient. The roasted cauliflower and wild mushrooms were amazing. I also got the cheese plate and the asparagus which were really good and served to share. The service was incredible. I'd definitely go back again!"", ""Great tapas!  Not sure if it's on the menu, but I do recommend asking for a pitcher of sangria. Make sure you enjoy it over fabulous conversation."", ""I just got back from Spain, so I came here thinking I could relive some of the same food experiences state-side.  Not even close.  First, the jamon iberico tasted like it's been sitting for a long while.  The olive oil on top was a dead give away.  Very dry, tough and a bit stale.  The butifarra flatbread barely had any butifarra.  It's not a seasoning, it's a sausage.  Try adding some.  Their patatas bravas were more like a tater tot (about 8 total), with a dollop of unnatural looking orange mayo on top of each.  I'll put my version up against theirs any day of the week...and win.  Also, pan con tomate is not bruschetta.  Go easy on the toppings.  I've literally had the same menu items from a cafeteria in a department store in Spain (El Corte Ingles) for about $150 less and about 10 times better.  If they can figure this out, why can't this place?"", 'Great happy hour. Small plates are nice to share. Bar is large, comfortable and bartenders are very courteous.', ""The food was excellent. We've been here during our first year of moving to Philadelphia. (5 years ago)\n\nI had to take off one star, not because of the food or service. Both were great.

The food was really good. I have no complaints as to quality and taste. The sangria was delicious.\nI was really disappointed with the amount of food. I am 100% aware this was tapas, but it truly was not enough food. You would think for a multi-course meal, you would at least leave the restaurant comfortable. It was just not a satisfying amount of food. I also felt a bit rushed. \nI will probably not be returning to Amada. If you want a light lunch or a snack I highly recommend this restaurant. However, this is just not enough food for dinner.', ""I cannot believe what my husband  and I experienced tonight. We showed up and my reservation had not gone through opentable.com and the manager, Brennan, was quick to the rescue to have me get a drink at the bar as she was able to find a table for my husband and I.

We had an incredible waitress, Karey, that made us feel like family.

It was just super fresh and perfect. \n\nFor entrees, we got the \'Crab Stuffed Pepper\', \'Wild Mushroom Rice\', Chicken with the Fried Egg and this Sausage Flatbread.

Service was attentive and friendly. I had the sangria and it was lovely - just like in Spain', ""We picked this place with a group of friends to take the apperetif on a terrace with typical Spanish tapas.\n\nThis spot was a perfect fit for what we were looking for. The terrace gives out to a calm street without almost any car traffic and the tapas were of a really high quality, as well as the tapas on their own. We especially appreciated the olives and the toast with tomatoes. On my side I've also enjoyed a lot their hard cheese with truffle oil. \n\nThe service was also quite nice and timely, with several servers making sure we had all we needed. Even if we had a bit of a time pressure to free that table before the next group (we just walked up to the restaurant while searching for a nice outdoors table), the service was still quite enjoyable."", ""Went to Amada the other day for lunch. It was so good. I started with cheese, apples, and lavender infused honey. It was so good. I loved the hint of lavender in the honey. It was subtle but it was good. I also had a Spanish tortilla. Oh, it was so tasty!  As an entree I had chorizo and goat cheese in tomato broth. The tomato broth was very good, you could tell it was real tomato. I dipped the chorizo in the cheese. So many flavors at once, so good!  The dessert was not my favorite. I don't remember what it was called because it was pretty unforgettable.  The service was pretty good. I also had an americano. It was really smooth."", ""Dinner at Amada is warm yet lively, and the food is, of course, good. There are typical tapas plates (patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, etc) - but I think Amada shines with their other plates.\n\nIn particular, their pimientos are addictive (hi, garlic sauce), and the madre e hijo was put together so well - a fun name on a delicious dish (mom & son - chicken & egg, get it?). Truffle knocked it out of the park.\n\nThere are some very friendly folks working here, but with how immensely busy Amada gets, it does feel spotty here and there because servers are constantly flitting about. Prepare for a slightly longer meal as well (which is how tapas should be, anyway), as they pace their courses a bit longer.\n\nI think Amada is a fine place to eat for a special occasion, and it's fun to try their take on different tapas."", ""Came here randomly with a bunch of friends.  Service was great, it was a little loud overall, and it was a little smokey in there because of the open air kitchen.  A little less noise and better ventilation and I would have given this place 5 stars.  But more importantly, the food was pretty good!\n\nSangria (5/5): get! Must get! The perfect balance of fruit, alcohol and just overall delicious!\n\nFlat bread with mushrooms, artichoke, manchego cheese (4/5): pretty good but nothing to write home about.  Nice and crispy the way I like them.  \n\nLavender honey truffle manchego cheese (5/5): delicious!  One my faves for the night, granted I'm partial to manchego and honey.\n\nTrout (5/5): perfectly seasoned and seared.  Definitely will get this again.\n\nLamb chop (5/5): again, perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I think we ended up with medium rare.  We just asked the waiter to let the chef to know to prepare it as he thinks best as opposed to asking for a certain cooked level. \n\nWild mushrooms (4/5): really good.  One star off for the tiny portion size.  \n\nRoasted cauliflower 5/5): so incredibly yummy!  It's not just roasted cauliflower.  There's goat cheese and other things in there that made this dish out of this world.  My entire group agreed this was the best dish of the night!\n\nScallops (1/5): it tasted like they were caked in salt.  I drank a whole glass of water afterwards.  Do. Not. Get.\n\nChocolate tart and puff pastry hazelnut desserts (2/5): not impressed.  Would not order again.  The chocolate tart was ok, but nothing really.  The hazelnut puff pastry seemed like it was confused as it also had some caramel banana slices on top so it seemed like a banana foster but was clearly not."", ""Restaurant week review: first time here, and I'll definitely be back not during restaurant week.

Everything we had was delicious, but we think we liked he flatbreads the best. The grilled seafood was very flavorful. Everyone loved the garlic shrimp, which were cooked perfectly. Olives were a hit as well. Desserts were great too. \n\nWhile everything was tapa sized, we didn't leave hungry. We were very content without being stuffed like you are at some places.

I made a reservation, so the hostess sat us right away and even offered to take our coats.\n\nOur server came over quickly and filled our water glasses. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was delicious! It's a pretty good deal to split between two people (4x the price of a single glass, but you get at least 6 pours out of it).\n\nWe did tapas a la carte, ordering 7 plates after the server recommended at least 3 per person. They sent the plates out slowly, so we would only have a few on our table at the time. It was so nice to be able to sit and enjoy each dish instead of being overwhelmed by getting them all at once.\n\nSome of our favorites were the ham croquettes, spicy potatoes, and lamb meatballs. We were so full after everything, that we almost turned down dessert. But after we got our hands on a dessert menu, we ended up splitting the Spanish custard - which was fantastic.\n\nOne of the best restaurants I've been to in Philly.

The first time, I visited because of the glowing reviews on Yelp and I was hoping to enjoy my meal as much as everyone else. The menu was certainly interesting and I honestly did want to try every item on the menu, great variety and high quality ingredients used. My only problem was that all of our dishes were extremely poorly seasoned. Some were too bland and a lot were too high in salt. I asked my family just to be sure and it was the general consensus that some dishes were inedible because it tasted like someone's salt shaker top came off. A few weeks later, I went back with a friend and we had a similar experience. And finally I tried one more time because another friend of mine had picked this restaurant, and again the food was a disappointment. I've never really had to criticize a restaurant with this particular issue (the food's either decent or of low quality; after that it's service quality etc etc) so I'm a bit confused. Amada seems very high end and meticulous with other aspects of the business, I wonder how they missed the mark on so the cooking."", 'Not impressed at all. Have eaten tapas many times and in Spain and the pulpo and calamari are staple simple grilled dishes which means the quality of the fish is the most important aspect.

This 2nd time our bartender was so nice. We came Monday night around 6:30 (March 26th). Our bartender was an older Hispanic gentleman. We ordered 2 white sangria and 2 red sangria. Both sangria was delicious. I was craving a charcuterie and cheese board. It's a little pricey but I spoke to him and he helped me picked out a Mixto board for the meat and 1 cheese, the manchego cheese with lavender.

Overall, good!', 'While not everything was of equal quality (incredible meatballs, cheese board, desserts, salsas/good but not quite incredible potatoes, tortilla española) I felt the overall experience was exactly what I want to get when I eat out. I didn\'t just have dinner, I had a damn meal. And  by god, I will be thinking about this meal for a long time. Rarely would I describe a meal as ""cinematic"".', ""Came here with my girlfriend around 7 o'clock on a Thursday night and they were fully booked but we were able to grab a small table in the bar area. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the garlic sausage flatbread, and the lamb meatballs which were all very delicious and I highly recommend them. They also have a very large wine selection. Would definitely come back again!"", 'Food and atmosphere was wonderful and they make some incredible gin and tonics. My boyfriend and I ended up here for a late Valentines dinner and we loved every dish we got! The waitress and staff were all so nice. The dishes are tapas style so it was fun picking numerous dishes. My favorite was the chicken with the poached egg. The sauce was absolutely delish!! We will definitely eat here again.', 'Great service. They have Estrella beer on tap! Loved the alcachofas y setas flatbread, mixed cheese plate, and pan con tomate.', 'After a short wait, the 6 of us enjoyed the Restaurant Week Lunch price fixed menu. Tapas, tapas and more tapas. Great efficient attentive service Thanks Alyssa and crew). The food covered a wide swath and all was cooked to exquisite perfection. The homemade sangria (we had the blanco) was fantastic!  And the Estralla cerveza was tasty. We are looking forward to going back for dinner.', 'Everything about this place was spot on for me.

It was definitely the way to go for a first-time visit', ""My wife and I had a late, week-night reservation here for a spontaneous date. Reservation was at 10:45 pm and the Amada kitchen closes at 11:00. Despite this, our server was gracious, didn't rush us, and made sure we got to try all of the dishes we wanted.\n\nI also loved how accessible Amada was. It's only a block or so away from the subway and there are a bunch of affordable parking lots near by.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order the lamb meatballs.

This time, I was much more impressed.  We started with a pitcher of the sangria Blanca, tasted many dishes with ham, got a little turned off by the plethora of smoky flavors in a few (which I'm normally a huge fan of, but the patatas bravas were like licking a firepit), and finished with some delightfully not-too-sweet desserts.  I'll be back."", 'All you really need to know is this place is a must try! Great ambience, outstanding service and the food- delicious!', ""Best tapas restaurant I've been to.

I didn't give 5 stars because I have eaten at other tapas restaurants that had equal quality food at a better value. We started with the assorted meats and the manchango cheese plate, both were good. Next, we had the lamb meatballs and octopus, both were good but not great. Next we ordered the olives and empanadas, the olive marinade was great and the empanadas were delicious as well, they had a strong roasted pepper flavor. We then had the clams which were by far the best, but not very filling. The broth was great for dipping bread, don't be afraid to ask for more bread. We also shared the olive oil ice cream which was very good as well. Overall good experience but bang for your buck there are places that are just as good."", 'Not too many complaints about this place. The restaurant has a very extensive tapas menu, so anyone can find something that they would like. These tapas did not take me to Spain but they got me pretty close. The pulpo and the croquetas are must haves. \n\nDuring out visit, we ate at the bart and the male bartenders were very attentive. The food came out pretty fast in different waves. Also, the restaurant has a very generous tapas happy hour menu that contains multiple items for around $5 bucks. \n\nNote: the tapas portions are small, which are typical at these types of restaurants, so do mot expect to be stuffed from two-three plates. \n\nI hope to visit this restaurant when I visit Philadelphia again.', 'My husband and I came in on a Friday night at 7:30. We had a reservation, and glad we did! This is truly one of the best meals I\'ve ever had in my life. I had the red sangria (amazing) and he had a few craft beers. We shared 6 tapas, which we later realized we could have gotten 4-5 to share and been full but we don\'t regret getting a little more because it was all so great. Here\'s what we got:\n\nManchego cheese with truffle lavender honey. I LOVED it, my husband happily ate it but a few bites in he said ""I feel like this honey is something that I\'m supposed to like but I\'m not crazy about"". I, on the other hand, thought he was just crazy for saying that. \n\nQuinoa salad- great! \nLamb meatballs- sooo good and tender! Probably my favorite of the night \n\nOctopus- my first time having octopus, I really liked it, but probably my least favorite of the night (that shows how much I loved my meal). On the other hand it was my husbands favorite \n\nPork- great \n\nCauliflower- really good, there\'s also some broccoli thrown in there. Really well seasoned with just the amount of roasted-ness\n\nService was great, there was nothing else I could have asked for. Go here!', 'Classy, dressy place with a romantic atmosphere.

Our waiter was very polite and attentive as well, and made excellent recommendations, especially for the dessert. I will be back!', ""The Madre E Hijo was great and the paella was the closest I've ever had compared with my time in Spain.

We came right at the time of our reservation... maybe got there TWO minutes early and had to sit at the bar for a while before our table was ready. Not that big of a deal.. we enjoyed sangria and one of their fancy gin & tonics. The food was great but I definitely preferred Garces Trading co. (One of Jose garces' other restaurants)"", 'Amada in my opinion is a bit overrated. I went here on a date and grabbed a two-top on the bar area.  The cocktails are expensive and are ""ok"", but nothing that I would start a conversation about.  The several glasses of wine we had were so warm, they might have well been above the grill. This place boasts its wine list and I was sorely disappointed.  Every interaction with the staff was so movie-planned awkward I could have sworn there was a camera. Having lived in Spain, I know my tapas.  Here, they do a tapas fusion modern take on the classics that I totally disapprove of.  Of course in Spain, you have expensive and cheap tapas, and you get what you pay for...but here they try to get creative and IMO drift away from what it\'s suppose to be. Flavors were lacking...not impressed. I\'m on the fence about going back, but perhaps a redeeming second chance is in order.', 'Amazing cuisine, excellent service. Everything from the peppers with trout roe to the lamb abondigas to the crab-stuffed peppers and more, the food is delicious and of the highest quality. Everything is just gorgeous!', ""I absolutely loved Amada! My family was visiting and I wanted to take them to a nice dinner, so I made a reservation at Amada at 7. This was definitely on the earlier side for them, because as we left it was packed. The space is huge and we were seated in the furthest room in the back, which was fine. \n\nThe service was fantastic. We were feeling slightly overwhelmed with the options, so the waiter told\nUs his favorite dishes from each part. We ended up going with most of those and were happy with everything! The waiter also suggested a different wine than the one we chose and it was amazing. \n\nWe started with the chorizo Pamplona and the caña de Cabra (fig and cherry marmalade). I could have passed on the chorizo, but I highly recommend this or another cheese dish. Next, we had the crab stuffed peppers and grilled octopus, both delicious! Then, we had the spanish flatbread with Artichokes, Wild Mushrooms, Black Truffles, Manchego. So yummy. For vegetables, we had the cauliflower and asparagus. I could have done without the asparagus, it comes out in a milky soup- not a fan and difficult to serve. Finally, we had the scallops and lamb chops. The scallops were amazing and cooked perfectly. The lamp chops were delicious and much larger than expected.\n\n\nOverall, our experience was everything we could have asked for. Before we even left, my family said they can't wait to come back to try more dishes."", 'One of my go to restaurants for special occasions or for of town friends. \n\nGood cocktail and wine selection. When I go I order the tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Great tapas style food and the ambiance is great for catching up with friends. \n\n\nTry the dates and the cauliflower dishes. Everything is good.  Try the happy hour for good bites and specials on wine.', ""I'm always down for a good happy hour. They have $6 house wines here which are pretty decent. I had the crab stuffed peppers. You get two peppers and they are small but it is tapas style so you can't be mad at that. I will say they were very good. Wasn't sure what I was expecting but glad I chose that. It can get kind of crowded around the happy hour time so be sure to make a reservation or good luck finding a seat at the bar."", ""Gambas al ajillo: tasteless, boring -- do they even use real olive oil in this dish? It takes some skill to mess up gambas, but indeed they've done it. If they can't get this right, I see little reason to return."", 'There is something to be said for tapas-style dining. You get selections from a diverse menu, can easily order more if needed, and the dining tends to be relaxed.\n\nThe tapas at Amada come out slowly- an advantage to me, because you can really spend time tasting just a couple dishes at a time. Coupled with an interesting cocktail offering, and a very well curated Spanish wine list (which is almost always a better value than standard lists) the result is a very pleasurable meal.\n\nMy wife and I ordered dishes with artichoke and Parmesan, some flatbread, and cheeses- (served with paper thin apples and fig preserves). All good.\n\nBut the stand out were the lamb meatballs with a delicious smoky flavor that had us both opening our eyes in surprise at the same time. The clams in chorizo broth were a bit spicy for my wife but I loved them.\n\nMy wife likes a sangria INce in a while and they had three versions on offer. I stared with a bourbon cocktail that I liked - thankfully not that cloying sweetness of many bourbon drinks.\n\nWe both agreed that this was a great way to dine, and wished we had more places near us that offered this variety and quality.', ""I decided to give Amada a few tries before finally writing a review. The first time, I visited because of the glowing reviews on Yelp and I was hoping to enjoy my meal as much as everyone else. The menu was certainly interesting and I honestly did want to try every item on the menu, great variety and high quality ingredients used. My problem was that all of our dishes were extremely poorly seasoned. Some were too bland and a lot were too high in salt. I asked my family just to be sure and it was the general consensus that some dishes were inedible because it tasted like someone's salt shaker top came off. Especially for the price that I paid, I expected much much more. A few weeks later, I went back with a friend and we had a similar experience. And finally I tried one more time because another friend of mine had picked this restaurant, and again the food was not great. I've never really had to criticize a restaurant with this particular issue (the food's either decent or it's not; after that it's service quality etc etc) so I'm a bit confused, since Amada uses quality ingredients and is careful about presentation. Amada seems very high end and meticulous with other aspects of the business, I wonder how they missed the mark on the cooking."", ""First time visit to Amada in Philadelphia. The other times were at the now closed Amada in Atlantic City. I certainly miss that restaurant which was beautiful and open while this experience, although still nice inside, was on the noisy side.  \n\nIt was great going on restaurant week again since you get a good selection of diverse items especially if you go with a group. For this visit it was my wife and I.  For each course, except for dessert, you get to choose two items. Here is what we had:\n\nFirst Course\nArtisanal Spanish Olives - Always loved their olives. Nice selection of various sizes and tastes. \nFlash Fried Peppers, Salbitxada, Sea Salt - This has been one of my favorites and it was just the way I remembered it. Nice tasting, still crunchy, peppers with a good sauce.  \nSpicy Potatoes - Loved the flavors of spices that accentuated the creamy potato croquettes. One of my favorite flavors of the meal.\nGarlic Shrimp - Not a fan of this selection. Although there was a nice sauce on the bottom of the serving dish I didn't think the shrimp had much flavor. \n\nSecond Course\nCrab-Stuffed Pepper - Very good stuffed pepper. I thought the sauce my have masked the crab but the flavors blended perfectly. \nBaked Goat Cheese, Tomato, Basil, Almond - This was just ok. I didn't really care for the tomato for some reason. Almost tasted like it came from a can. \nFlatbread with Artichokes, Wild Mushrooms, Black Truffles, Manchego - This was one of the most delicious flatbreads I've ever had. Very crispy crust with all the flavors I love in one bite. \nSpanish Octopus - This is the second place we've had octopus during Center City restaurant week and again it just wasn't my favorite. Good flavors but some of the pieces were too chewy. \n\nThird Course (Dessert)\nI had the Puff Pasrty, Hazelnut Praline, Bergamot, Banana and my wife had the Egg Cream, Vanilla, Orange Meringue,Pistachio. Both were fine, but I'm not really a dessert person.\n\nThe bar had a great selection of wine, a good selection of beer, and nice specialty drinks. I loved the seasonal sangria.  \n\nThe service was good and they brought out the dishes very quickly and paused between courses which was great. My only complaint would be that my water glass wan't refilled.  \n\nOverall a nice experience. I would recommend Amada."", ""Urgh. This is really more like a 3.5 star review. The prob with Amada is that it is SO hit and miss. If I'm spending upwards of $300 for three people, I want it to be reliably good. I've come before and the food was more like five stars. We did the tasting menu with an out of town friend on Saturday night. Of the 13 dishes that came out, I'd say two were good. The sangria was terrible, and we tried both the red and the white. Service was five stars. We got seated at an excellent table (had a reservation, waited for a bit to get seated but whatev). Was so looking forward but mostly everything was super mediocre. I guess in the future would not recommend tasting menu."", 'Went here with three people- the dishes were either great or terrible- no in between...great dishes: asparagus, dates, artichoke, flatbread.\nHorrible: scallops, shrimp, cauliflower, tuna. The shrimp were cooked until they were hard and we love salt and felt like we ate a mouthful of salt water. Couldn\'t eat the cauliflower- it tasted pickled and just plain awful. The scallops were equally as salty, but edible because we were hungry. The food came out so randomly... side dishes ten minutes apart, then a salad, then a meat, then another side... I get that\'s the unique thing about here but it ruined the ""meal"". One guest, his dishes were the last 3 to come out, so we had all eaten all night and he hadn\'t. And then he felt rushed as he ate and we sat waiting for them. Our waiter hardly ever came out and we had six different runners requesting water for the salty food and they would never pass the message. I would never come back. :(', 'HAPPY HOUR REVIEW\n\nreally impressed with the quality and price with the happy hour choices here! 5pm-7pm happy hours are what makes the world go round.\ni started with the ""broken hugs"" cocktail which was delicious! it got packed pretty fast so definitely make it here right at 5pm if you can!\n\nAll tapas were $5, great deal!\n\nCOLD TAPAS:\nolives - delicious and perfectly salty. quantity was very generous, it lasted throughout our whole happy hour stay\n\nchorizo pamplona - this is laid out like cold cuts with some pieces of bread. great chorizo, lots of flavor\n\nsalpicon de mariscos - i didn\'t enjoy this very much but my boyfriend did. the octopus was in a red type of sauce and not something i was expecting.\n\naged manchego - this was my favorite tapa of the night! the lavender honey went so well with the cheese\n\nHOT TAPAS:\ncroquetas were a bit salty and i couldn\'t really taste the ham but these were fried perfectly\n\ntortilla espanola - this was my favorite hot tapa. it was almost like a little crepe cake with cheese and soft tortilla.\n\npimientos  de padron - i wish these were fried more but luckily they weren\'t very spicy! i wish they had a bit more breading as well\n\nchorizo bilbao - this was also a good choice, the chorizo was very flavorful and a generous amount was served\n\nall in all, for stephen starr happy hour, this place is legit and i definitely recommend. our bartender was great and even though he was working alone at the bar, did a great job at coming to us when we needed him and giving us our space as well', ""Amada's happy hour menu is pretty decent. You have a variety of options for $5 appetizers.  \n\nI needed something quick before heading back to DC so this was perfect. I sat at the bar, I didn't get a very welcoming vibe from the bartender though. He wasn't that busy and took forever to take my order. \n\nI had the Patatas Bravas - loved the smokey taste on these potatoes and the aioli on top tasted great.\n\nThe chicken skewers were a little dry but I liked the seasoning on it. The lemon and green herb sauce were the saver of this dish.  \n\nOverall, it was an ok place."", ""Fantastic restaurant, cuisine is some of the best in the city, and one of the better Spanish restaurants I've been to outside of Spain, great wine list, excellent ambiance and service too"", 'If you\'re in Philly and you want tapas or you want paella, come to Amada!

Definitely a must try!', ""Took friends from out of town here for dinner last night and what a disaster! I don't know what was going on with their cooling system but it was so unbearably hot that it ruined our experience. Sweat was literally pouring out of our bodies as we tried to eat our expensive dinner. We had to cut the meal short and go somewhere else it was so bad. This has always been one of our favorite places but the food wasn't as good as we've had in the past either. I know Jose Garces is going through some difficulties and it showed at the restaurant last night. Not sure we'll ever go back."", ""BEWARE the wine list.  The mark-up on bottles of wine are close to 5X.  A bottle of Faustino VII which sells at retail down the street for $12.99 is priced at $63 on the wine list.  Also, don't expect to have conversation in this restaurant, we had to shout across the table to be heard, the background noise level is VERY VERY high."", ""Most of the food items were very good, but some of them were very average and just not worth the price. If money is not an issue, this is a good place to try. Otherwise, make sure you stick to a few great menu items or you will be disappointed. I'll start with the items I thought were very good. I really enjoyed the Albondigas (Lamb Meatballs,Shaved Manchego), Ensalda de Jamon (Serrano Ham & Fig Salad,\nCabrales, Spiced Almonds), Alcachofas y Setas (Artichokes,\nWild Mushrooms, Black Truffles Manchego Flatbread) Gambas al Ajillo\n(Garlic Shrimp), and Alcachofas a la Parmesana\n(Parmesan Artichokes), The Manchego Pasamontes\n(Truffled Lavender Honey) was unique, but the portion was very small.  The Patatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes) were bland. The Chorizo was very chewy, and all I tasted was salt. The Scallops were average at best, and you get two scallops cut in half (so four pieces) for $26. Definitely not worth it. The atmosphere was very nice. Our waiter was polite and helped us decide what menu options to choose. I had a pretty good experience, but overall, I just can't really justify spending this much for food I was not that impressed with."", 'Much to my satisfaction, my dining partner made a reservation at this place last night. Just when I think I\'m on top of all the best places in philly, I\'m hit in the face with the realization that I don\'t know shit. \n\nReservation was obtained but not required at 6:15 on a Monday evening in late January. There is no happy hour in the dining area but perhaps it is present at the bar (there is suggested by the ""happy hour"" menu on the website). Ambiance is dope, wall of lanterns is actually a good instagram photo op.  \n\nDrink menu is enticing. Multiple sangria variations, drink menu, gin and tonic variations menu, beers and wines. Not just 3 beers either, there\'s quite a fair number. \n\nWe sat talking for a while bc I\'m outrageously interesting. I had my drink selection cued up since about 15 seconds after my ass hit the seat but I had to wait a minute for my companion to make his selection. I can\'t find the drink menu but if I remember correctly the name was something with hugs. It contained tequila (obviously), grapefruit juice, and some other stuff. It was tasty, perfect combo of sweet and tart. My companion ordered one of the gin and tonics served in a large wine-type glass with huge ice cubes and tonic to self pour. I later ordered one of the sangrias which was flavorful and stuffed to the brim with fruit pieces that I used to supplement my dinner. \n\nFor food this is a tapas place. I used to be against this shit bc I\'m keen on a large, hearty, mountain of food but this is pretty common occurrence in philly I have noticed and I rather enjoy tasting a bunch of different shit. We ordered a few things, all from the vegetables portion of the menu d/t my vegetarianism. Can someone please inform the menu-making person that ""trout"" is not vegetarian and that part should rather be moved to the ""pescados and carnes"" section. \n\nFirst to arrive was the amada\'s empanada, dough stuffed with spinach, artichoke, and manchego cheese. Delicious. Only two are given though, wtf?! I want moar.\n\nI forgot to mention, after ordering food they give you this delicious chunky orange/red dip with paper thin and crispy bread things. So fucking good I actually scooped that shit into my mouth with a spoon when we ran out of bread.\n\nSecond was the queso de cabra, goat cheese dollop surrounded by a DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSSS tomato sauce and 4 little slices of toasted broad. FOUR slices of bread? For real? How on earth are we supposed to scoop up all that delicious dip with four grape-sized italian bread slices? Absolutely spectacular. \n\nWe also got the colifor with cauliflower and some delicious white sauce and a whoel bunch of other spices. Garbanzos con espinacas: chickpeas, some roasted, some not depending on their location within the bowl, intertwined with some spinach leaves. Tasty as well but probably my least favorite, delicious nonetheless. \n\nUltimately this meal was spectacular. I look forward to returning.', ""One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. Not only was the food delicious but the wait staff was attentive and friendly yet also unobtrusive. Each dish was amazing on it's own and in the spaces where the dishes overlapped they paired excellently together. My favorite dish was the asparagus, I can't remember the exact name but the sauce it came in was amazing. For dessert I had the egg cream and an espresso. The sweetness of the eggcream paired with the bitterness of the espresso? Pure heaven. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu."", ""Food was great, male server was terrible!!! We saw him twice the entire night... asked for extra bread from three different people and never got it.  The bussers and hostess were great, but this server was one of the worst we've had.

A beautiful old building as well. Keep up the strong work!', 'The food was not that big. The atmosphere was pleasant and romantic. The pricing is fine, but the food should be the best tasting. Not what I expected.', ""I came to Amada with my friends for Restaurant Week Dinner. I had been eyeing the menu for a while and the food was delicious, but overall, I expected a little bit more. The portions were slightly small (which I guess is normal for tapas, especially for Restaurant Week), but overall, I really enjoyed dinner. \n\nAmbience: I really loved Amada's ambience and vibe! The restaurant was beautiful and we had a really nice table. The noise level was perfect and we were able to have a good conversation and the decorations and design was great. \n\nService: Service was good! Our waiter was very attentive and always kept our water glasses full. He helped us out with recommendations when we were ordering. \n\nFood: For restaurant week, each of us were able to order 2 first courses, 2 second courses, and a dessert. We all tried each other's dishes. Here is what we ordered:\n\nFirst Course:\n- Manchego cheese with truffle lavender honey: 4.5/5 - This dish was great for sharing and beautifully presented. The truffle lavender honey was really unique and all of us loved it! It paired great with the manchego, which wasn't a very strong cheese. \n- Garlic shrimp (Gambas al aljillo): 4/5 - The shrimp was cooked really well. It tasted fresh and was well-seasoned. The texture was great - the shrimp was perfectly tender.\n- Ensalada verde: 3.5/5 - I enjoyed the favas and greens in this salad and it was a much larger portion than many of the other dishes. However, there wasn't much flavor and I wish there was more than a few pieces of avocado in it. \n- Patatas bravas: 3.5/5 - I really liked the sauce that was paired with the potatoes - it was lighter than I expected and went well with the dense potatoes. Still, it wasn't particularly special though it is good for sharing.\n\nSecond Course: \n- Gambas a la plancha: 4.5/5 - I loved this dish! The shrimp was perfect crisp and seasoned on the outside and tender on the inside. The shell was even crisp enough to eat. I honestly just wish that it was a larger portion!\n- Lubina (sea bass) a la plancha: 4.5/5 - This fish was, again, very tender and had just a slight crisp from a sear on the surface. I loved the texture but the portion was pretty small and it was a little bit on the salty side.\n- Piquillos Rellenos (crab-stuffed pepper): 4/5 - The flavor of the crab was great. However, this was the smallest portion of the evening. \n- Coca de Butifarra (flatbread with sausage): 3.5/5 - This is definitely a satisfying dish, though it was a bit too oily and salty for my taste. I did enjoy the crisp of the crust. I would definitely recommend this if you're feeling hungrier! \n- Queso de Cabra: 4.5/5 - The goat cheese paired really well with the tomato based sauce it was baked in. The saltiness was just right - overall would really recommend ordering this! \n\nDessert:\n- Milhojas: 3.5/5 - I loved the flavors in this dessert (it wasn't just purely sweet), and I liked that there were varied textures. However, the puff pastry seemed almost like a store-bought cracker instead of freshly baked. Still, I really enjoyed the filling. \n- Tocinillo de Cielo: 3.5/5 - This dessert was very unique. The egg cream and meringue were really light and has a slight sweet and sour taste to it. I liked the texture, but the taste just wasn't really for me. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend coming to Amada! It's a great place to hang out with friends if you're looking for something fancier but still casual and low pressure. The food is enjoyable and tapas are always fun!"", ""Still waiting a half hour for a 8PM reservation. The management dosen't seem to care."", ""We came here on a Saturday night. When we entered, there is a big pig in the doorway. Foreshadowing?! \nThe place was full but still felt intimate since our table was in the back. Music is very nice at the end of the evening when you can hear it. Low flattering lighting. \nThe waiter suggested three plates per person but we over ordered. We requested the food be paced and he did it well. \nThe Rioja wine we ordered was amazing and will haunt me for a long time. \nThey started with a complimentary plate of chips and a tuna garlic olio. It was good and I would use the chips later with their dishes.  We ordered (not in order): \n\n1. Mixed cheese plate (w/Fresh queso de carba w/ balsamic strawberries, manchego w/ truffles lavender honey, & one other delicious cheese).  Mixed cheeses were awesome. Bread could have been toasted.

The server took it off the bill, even though we insisted that our dislike was purely a matter of our taste, and not any fault of the restaurant\'s. \n\nI loved the decor and ambiance, the flow of the meal, the helpfulness of the wait staff.

We ordered the half pig (which you need to order a few days in advance). It comes with four very large sides -- two tasty garbanzo bean-based dishes, potatoes with delightful onions, and very nice crispy scallions. We took home lots of leftovers. The portions are probably appropriate for 6-8. \n\nThey are super accommodating with dietary restrictions. It's the first thing they ask.

The pimientos de padron were also unfortunately replaced with shishito peppers instead of padron peppers (common but still disappointing for a place like this). \n\nAdditionally, service was poor and our waiter was rude to our table and just seemed to want to get us out of there.\n\nIn summary, not worth the normal price for the quality of dishes here and service didn't help either."", ""I recently celebrated my birthday dinner with my family at Amada. We had a fantastic time and I was glad I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday! The restaurant is beautifully designed. We were seated in the room towards the back which was way too dark and a bit too loud. The room was especially warm because they were having problems with the air conditioning. Service was good but not great. The food initially came out very quickly. We liked that they only brought 1 or 2 dishes out at time. However, there was a big lull in the middle, around 10-15 minutes when there was no food on the table and we were still waiting on 4 more plates. The food was really outstanding, so these minor flaws didn't ruin the night or make it a less than 5 star experience. Everyone loved their drinks- I had the Sangria Temporada. It was really good! I love sangria, both red and white, and this was kind of in the middle. I definitely recommend trying this if you're a sangria fan! I'll go into a little detail about each of the plates below. \n\nMust try plates- you really need to get these. Outstanding!\nCroquetas de Jamón ($7) - 5/5. We almost didn't get these but I was so glad we did! The romesco was incredibly flavorful and almost stole the show from the perfect croquetas.\nDátiles con Almendras ($12) - 5/5. All the flavors on this plate went together so well. The cheese WOW.\nPernil Asado ($18) - 5/5. Omg. If you only get only one plate, let it be this! So delicious. Pork was cooked perfectly, incredibly moist with the crispiest, most flavorful skin imaginable. Paired so well with the orange slices. Incredible dish.\n\nAlso amazing, highly recommend. Would definitely order again.\nArroz Temporado ($12) - 4.5/5. Perfectly cooked with incredible flavor. The black truffle flavor came through very strongly and really made the dish.\nMadre e Hijo ($13) - 4.5/5. This chicken is so good! This plate works really well, the components come together for an amazing bite.\nColiflor ($9) - 4.5/5. Love the colors on this plate. Green, purple, and white cauliflower. Again, the flavors paired so well in this dish.\n\nProbably wouldn't order again (because I'd want to try some new plates), but still very tasty.\nPiquillos Rellenos ($13) - 4/5. Lots of crab. Cooked well.\nAlbóndigas ($13) - 4/5. Very good flavor!\nAlcachofas a la Parmesana ($11) 3.5/5. - The sauce that accompanied the artichokes was amazing, so rich and creamy. The artichokes themselves were slightly underwhelming.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't order again.\nGambas al Ajillo ($12) - 2.5/5. This was the only dish with which I was disappointed. Boring and lacking in flavor.\n\nOverall, a really great meal. I love eating tapas style and being able to try a lot of different dishes. Looking forward to my next visit to Amada!"", ""This is my favorite tapas restaurant in the city. Most recently, I had the chef's tasting menu, and spent 2 hours getting through 10 dishes spread out across 5 courses. \n\nThe first couple of courses are very light, and more sauce than substance. Try not to fill up too much on the amazing flatbread. \n\nOf the main courses, the seafood paella and the grilled scallops were my personal favorites. There's an explosion of flavor (and probably a hefty amount of butter) in both dishes. \n\nThe roasted pork was a bit too fatty and salty. I hear some people are really into that though. \n\nFor dessert, I had a creme brûlée - esque cup of flavored foam on top of a sweet pudding, with a hint of whiskey and pistachio flavor. Heavy on the calories, but at that point in the meal sticking to a calorie count was already a lost cause. \n\nAll in all, fantastic service and food. Definitely worth the $75 per plate."", ""Very fancy and fun! Great date place or special occasion place with lots of fun things to try. Don't let The menu intimidate you.

So here we go!\n\n-Ensalada Verde 5/5\n(Green Salad, Asparagus, Favas, Avocado, Green Beans) \nDamn this salad was GOOD! It was fresh, delicious, and flavorful. Seriously! It was my favorite dish out of everything i ate here. Never thought I'd say that a salad was my favorite dish. \n\n-Croquetas de Jamon  5/5\n(Ham Croquettes, Romesco Caldo Gallego Chorizo, Smoked Ham with White Beans, And Potato Espuma)\nGuys, these are amazing! They don't look special upon first glance, but they are delicious! The smoke jam flavor totally comes through and the sauce that is paired with croquettes complement it so well! Get it \n\n-Gambas a la plancha 3/5\nThis was a beautiful and simple dish. I love shrimp and to see nice, grilled pieces of shrimp made me salivate instantly. Unfortunately, to me, the seasoning was a little too salty for my taste. When I added more lemon juice to the shrimp, it definitely improved the flavor and felt less salty. So word of advice, squeeze that lemon! \n\n-Patatas Bravas 5/5 \nGet this! No, they're not JUST fries. They look like fries but are a million times better. These had an amazing smoky flavor that just elevated this to the next level. Get this. \n\n-Bocadillo de Serranito 3/5\n(Slow Roasted Pork Sandwich, Serrano Ham, Hard Boiled Egg, Shishito Peppers)\nI was so excited to try this dish and it wasn't my favorite. The flavor was a little overwhelming and it was super greasy and fatty. Because of how heavy this dish was, I found the flavors to be a bit cloying. \n\n-Bocadillo de Pavo 4/5\n(Herb Roasted Turkey Sandwich, Roasted Peppers, Romesco Aioli)\nThis was better than the bocadillo de serranito (according to both me and my husband). \n\n-Tocinillo de Cielo 3/5\nThis was the dessert. I don't quite know how to explain it. You can see it in my picture. It was good, but something in it made it less enjoyable. I think there was pastry soaked in a sweet liqueur/liquid of some sort. The flavors were a little strong and it took away from the enjoyment of the dish as a whole. \n\nOverall, Amada is pretty good. The ambiance is quite nice as it has an industrial feel to the decor. The food is also pretty good. I would definitely come back!"", 'Good not great food. A tad expensive for what you get. Lackluster innatentive, service.', ""I came here for restaurant week with two of my friends and had been highly anticipating the visit since I booked the reservation! I'm super excited to say that the food did not disappoint and lived up to my hyped up expectations. The menu was a prix fixe selection of tapas and the dishes were meant to be shared. We each ordered different plates because we wanted to try some of everything and honestly this is a method that I would recommend. \n\nUpon walking into the restaurant, you experience a cozy, sophisticated atmosphere and are immediately greeted by friendly staff (Also, the smell of truffles fills the room, so we were already excited!). Our waiter, Edwin, was excellent and gave us great recommendations. The restaurant week menu gives you the option to choose two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert. I highly recommend getting the manchego cheese plate because the lavender truffle honey is to die for!! We loved it so much we bought two jars when our waiter told a they sell it in-house! Other stand-out dishes include the coliflor (get this) and the ham croquettes. \n\nOverall, from the attentiveness of the staff, to the pacing of the meal, to the delicious dishes that were served (especially during a hectic week like restaurant week), I was really happy with my experience at Amada."", ""Wowowow. I think that was my entire thought process during my meal at Amada, which was stellar from beginning to end. I came here for for their restaurant week deal, and it was the best decision I've made in a long time. My friend and I ordered a ton, so here's a quick breakdown on all the tapas we got and my thoughts on them:\n\nAged Manchego cheese: 4.5/5: I would eat the truffle lavender honey it comes with by itself. Downside: only 3 small pieces of bread\n\nPatatas Bravas: 4/5: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce on top also gives it great flavor, but not spicy at all\n\nGambas al Ajillo: 4/5: garlic-butter sauce was delicious; shrimp were extremely juice and flavorful\n\nCroquetas de Jamon: 4/5: wasn't a huge fan of the sauce on the bottom, but the croquetas were super rich and perfectly fried\n\nScallops a la Plancha: 1000/5: the best thing I ate this evening. Rubbed with spices, super flavorful, and extremely tender. I would've been good to call it quits right there\n\nHanger Steak a la Plancha: 4.5/5: also extremely flavorful, medium well\n\nCoca de Butifarra: 5/5: think of the world's best pizza. That's what you have in front of you - every bite was delicious, and it was a great combination of tomato, spinach, and sausage\n\nMadre e Hijo: 4.5/5: I didn't know chicken could taste like that. It was extremely soft and was fantastic. Bonus points for the truffles\n\nTocinillo de Cielo: 4/5: meringue on top is absolutely perfect, and pistachios add a nice small crunch\n\nTLDR: I had the best meal I've eaten in weeks. Everything about Amada is great, from the service to the food. Can't recommend this place enough."", 'Most amazing Tuna dip and pork ever. Unreal atmosphere. Wow!  Wine list was awesome and shrimp and garlic rock!  \n\nWent again yesterday for lunch!  The food is amazing and I love the service and atmosphere!', ""Tapa central here and with the happy hour you cannot go wrong!! The wine was $6 a glass, average to smaller pours but the wine was tasty. I am a bit biased to tapas since I lived in Spain but these ones had personal touches to them where I've never seen before. We tried the patatas bravas which were more like a tatertot consistency with brava sauce on top. The jamón serrano is a classic go to for me and it was served with caper berries, pickles and mustard. The manchego and honey combo with the apples was refreshing and tart.  I would say the only underwhelming thing was the crab stuffed peppers. A bit over priced but then again Philadelphia is not known for crabs so I could understand the price spike. With happy hour and $5 tapas I would definitely recommend coming here. I would love to try the olives next time along with the croquetas."", 'While I have had many pleasant happy hour experiences at Amada, I was there yesterday for brunch and it was quite a disappointment. Enough to make me feel like this review was in order. \n\nA friend made our reservation through Open Table and arrived before I did. When I got to Amada, the hostess was unwelcoming and seemed like it was a Herculean effort to see if my friend had arrived. I was glad my friend saw me come in and gestured me over to her table, otherwise I might still be standing at the hostess station.\n\nThe brunch menu has changed since my first very enjoyable brunch here 3 years ago, and not for the better. There is a $27 prix fixe menu or one can order a la carte. CC, my companion, chose the prix fixe and I went with the latter.\n\nA bread basket that came with my friend\'s prix fixe was brought to the table. It contained a croissant and 2 other bread items and while it was ensconced in a napkin, all three of the breads/pastries were cold. \n\nItems on toast (and hard, mean, sharp pieces of toast that are painful to eat) appear quite a bit on the menu now. I ordered the avocado toast ($9)\n (yes, sue me for that) and got 3 pieces of the vicious, oily toasted bread with maybe a tablespoon of avocado spread across all 3 pieces. The avocado was fresh and tasted fine and the tomato escabeche that was spread on the bread was tasty but I scraped everything off to eat separately because the bread was so hard. I guess it was grilled but it was grilled for too long.\n\nMy second item was the Revuelto ($15) which the menu listed as soft scrambled eggs, shrimp, wild mushrooms and black truffle toast. I got a plate of warm-ish, watery eggs, no mushrooms in sight, 3 tepid, pathetic, half raw shrimp and 3 very thin slices of the very hard toast that I set aside. \n\nThe items on the menu that stated they came with \'baby greens\' showed up with ONE piece of arugala as a garnish. \n\nI\'d ordered a Campari and soda that was good (and hard to ruin) but the server never asked if I wanted a second drink and when he did come by to check on the table, his question was cursory rather than really interested. Water glasses were replenished regularly but the energy of the restaurant was very low and it felt everyone was on auto-pilot. The place was not busy, which surprised me for a beautiful Saturday. It\'s possible the construction and street closure on 2nd St. due to the fire at The Little Lion could be part of it, but I don\'t think that\'s the only reason.\n\nWe were not offered tea or coffee with or after the meal and while CC, my dining pal, wanted dessert, she opted to have it elsewhere.\n\nWhen we left, the Ice Princess hostess did not acknowledge us in any way, not even to say a phony ""thanks for coming, have a nice day."" I think this was my final, sad visit to Amada. Too bad.', ""Place is totally overrated. As a party of four withe a reservation, we were promptly seated, which was nice. Service was slow and inattentive (our server constantly forgot our ordered drinks). Food was mediocre. We ordered almost everything from the menu  (tapas that was), except the larger meals on the bottom of the menu. NOT a single dish we ordered was actually enjoyable.  Nobody in my party was wow'ed by the dishes. Our friends from Philly who recommended this place felt really bad that we came all the way from NY for such low quality food and service.

So very tasty.  Also, cannot go wrong with the manchego cheese plate and the olives (would have loved more of the black and less green).  What was not good:  calmari - very hard, overcooked.  I think if the pieces were slightly thicker, this would not have been an issue.  Also, the sea bass was very fishy.  My husband didn't mind it, but I could not eat it. The chorizo was super salty for my tastes. Would probably go again and would get the lamb meatballs - so good!!!  The olive oil ice cream dessert was good.  Could have used more of the yummy caramel."", ""Just had the most delicious lunch at Amada. La Mesa de Jose tasting was everything you could want. Such a great mix of flavors.

The problem was a lot of the things we ordered when seated was sold out *tears* so we ended up ordering our second best items off the menu. They were good but I bet the sold out items were even better. Maybe next time!!"", ""I have been to Amada a few times both in small groups (2-4) and then twice with a large group (6+). The space itself is relatively large, they have two rooms and can generally (read below!) accommodate larger groups. \n\nThe Food (9/10)\nThe tapas are great for sharing and always delicious. My favorite are the patatas bravas. The mains are good too, I recommend ordering the paella if you have a group of 4 or more, its huge but so worth it. The only reason the food isn't a 10/10 is that it really isn't anything stand out. It is certainly tasty but nothing that is by far and away better than other Spanish restaurants serving similar style cuisine. \n\nService (5/10)\nI have been here a  handful of times, one two separate occasions I was made to wait over an hour to be seated (I had a reservation both times). The first time it wasn't too big of a deal as it was only 4 of us and we were happy to wait at the bar (even though a table should have been ready since we had a reservation). The last time we went there was a different story, we were a group of 8 that I called ahead about (1 month in advance). Then followed up with (3 days prior and the night of), then upon arriving we were made to wait awkwardly at the small doorway for an hour while we waited for a table to become available. We were unable to find space at the bar and on top of all of that we were treated as though we were an inconvenience,  even though I had followed up and called multiple times to ensure the restaurant was prepared. It was rude and did sour the evening a bit. \n\nAll in all I would probably only recommend going if you wouldn't mind waiting even when you have a reservation and only in small groups. If I do go back, it will not be in a group."", 'We went to Amada this past Saturday night for our first wedding anniversary and had a great experience.

The food was delicious as always. We ate a TON. The bacon wrapped dates are always a must, as is the octopus. The manchego with truffle honey was delicious as always. By now, we have sampled most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed with any dish.

Every second weekend of the month, they along with other restaurants, do something out of the ordinary for the community. They want to lure more people back in the area to generate more revenue for their town. The first time they tried ""coffee cocktails and desserts,""  it was a disaster through no fault of theirs. We had a blizzard so they had very few people. \nThis is their second time and we\'ll, they still need to work out some issues. Our seats were on the side of the counter by the coffee beans\' grinder. A lovely young lady took out order and shortly thereafter have us our choices beverages. \nI chose Nastrino Latte. It is a latte where I choose hazelnut, espresso, blue ribbon laced into their foam art  Hubby preferred his dessert Affagato. That consists of a scoop of vanilla ice cream with Costa Rica and Ethiopian espresso. They took the espresso and poured it over the ice cream. Finally The Kid ordered El Diablo. It gives you Satan\'s  blood, double Dutch cocoa, espresso of course, cinnamon, heavy cream and whole milk. If you\'re lactose intolerant, I don\'t recommend this drink. The Kid Knew it was going to have hot sauce in their beverage. While most did not care for this drink , the kid loved it. I ordered the Nastrino Latte. Mine contains Hazelnut, espresso and their foam looked exactly was mine. The beverage also had a got pepper to help stir your coffee. \nEverything was fine but we waited over 15 minutes to be acknowledged for the check. We flagged sudden our waitress who promised another waitress will give us out tab. We waited and that still didn\'t happen so we went up to the counter again. After she have us the check, we waited another five minutes wondering if she forgot about us. That\'s there only fault I would say they have. Because it\'s their ""open for after dark hands crafted coffee cocktails"", they have to continue working out the links.

A few of us arrived maybe 5 minutes after the rest of the party and we asked the waiter to give us a few minutes to decide. Not even 5 minutes, he returns asking us ""Ladies are you ready?"". My friend and I ordered whatever our eyes landed on and my other friend ordered a grilled cheese only because he pulled the menu out of her hand before she could read anything else. \nMy friends who came before us had ordered plethora of small plates. The buffalo chicken dip was pretty decent, however I wasn\'t a huge fan of the pita bread. I get that its their thing, but it was an odd combo. The mac&cheese was okay, it looked like they skimped out on the potato chip crumble on top. The pesto hummus was decent again, nothing special. The chicken bombs were a meh, it was like chicken wings except they pulled the meat down so that the bone was exposed like a lollipop. For the main meal I got the chicken parm burger and that was a let down. The chicken parm wasn\'t the classically crispy chicken patty that you\'d expect but it was just a plain chicken patty with no breading encased in pita bread with with melted mozzarella and marinara. Not super great. The fries that came out were limp and they weren\'t meant to be shoelace fries either. \n\nI didn\'t try the pizza but it looked a lot better than most things we had.

Our beer sat in the sun at the rooftop bar for at least 10 minutes while our waiter walked past it numerous times. Finally, it was delivered warm. There were no utensils on our table and we had to ask the water server for them after our food was delivered.

Then came the avocado BLT, I have to say pork belly instead of bacon is more than perfect - succulent, flavorful, and not greasy at all. Service from Kevin was very friendly.

Oh, did I mention that the exterior is rather unassuming (major understatement)? The pale, slightly water-stained and unadorned concrete which hides the original brick facade is accompanied by plain, flat brown doors and windows. It hides a bright and beautifully reclaimed interior...and if you look up, you\'ll see the building also is home to a beautiful open second story patio.\n\nDrinks: Full bar with decent domestic and imported wines by glass and bottle, some whiskeys, and a mix of great craft brews, plus bottles and cans of standard swill. (Actually, the entire list is pretty good!)\n\nFood: Like the decor (check out the web site and photos for more details--we missed a few) the menu offerings are an hodge-podge with no distinct theme. The selections range from Quinoa Salad to Mac and Cheese to Cheesesteak Egg Roll starters, from Flatbread sammies and Gyros to Jerk Salmon plates and Pizza. Got the idea?\n\nWe picked a good hoppy IPA to accompany our Margherita Pizza. The crust was crisp and brown on the bottom (our friends thought it burned...but not us). We thought it was just right; it was topped with a decent sauce and quite a lot of cheese. To my liking, it also had a chewy Neapolitan-style ""corniccione"" (raised outer edge). All in all good but not outstanding pizza.\n\nFriends ordered and enjoyed the hearty black bean chili (a special) and shared (a bit soggy) fried eggplant flatbread sandwich with a side salad. Both were ok...but texture of the sandwich was a bit mushy; no evidence of ""fried.""\n\nTake time to walk around the interior, and hopefully appreciate the effort that went into redoing this place. It very well might will make you show the whites of your teeth.

The grilled cheese is amazing, but so is all of the food, I can't say a bad thing about it. \n   More recently, a few of us went here for dinner and asked if they were seating outside. They said yes and happily took us to our table outside on the sidewalk. 30 minutes pass and not a single person approaches us, all while workers walked by us inside not stopping or making a single effort to serve us. So we left and went next door to marmont, which was great. Unfortunately, the bad left a BAD taste in our mouths. We will be back eventually, but with all the great restaurants in the area, its not first on our list."", ""I just need to start this off by saying I am bias. Old City is really my favorite part of Philly so almost every place there I tend to love. This honestly might be one of the best renovated and decorated places that I have been to in Old City.

The brick oven pizza we got was perfect with a nice doughy crust and the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. We also got the Mac & Cheese which was really good with a chip crust on it and the cheesesteak egg rolls which were the first ones I've ever had that actually tasted like a cheesesteak.

I'm not sure what their recipe is,but this didn't taste like sherry as some places go heavy with.  The mushroom soup had lots of crab and mushrooms in it and okay flavor, but was served barely warm.  The fries with beef short rib and cheese sauce were our next item and were good.  Lastly, she had a salad, which wasn't great and I had the roast beef sandwich.

We were sat at a high top in the back bar which is not ideal for dinner but we had no choice. Sadly, our server was just as miserable. The food is expensive, which we knew going in.

But honestly I understand because the food is so great. I highly recommend: the prime rib eggs rolls, the jumbo lump crab cakes, and the tavern short rib fries. Always delicious.', ""# 1 reasons I gave this place a five star is cuz they deserve it ! The chef is great the food is by far amazing , esp the scallops ! Everything I have tried has been great. I honestly order three some times four corses and every one is on point . They usually have a decent live band on weekend evenings and usually busy , on that note I almost gave 4 and  half stars only because it is busy and some times staff is over whelmed , if your in a hurry don't go but if you want quality food do! I look at it like this if I have to wait 30 mins for a table to eat there , it will be much shorter Than the week or two wait that il be counting down  until I get time to go back ! With all that being said , the food is well worth Any wait you may have to endure to sit at a table , I highly recommend , compliments to the chef !! \n\nPs staff can be hit or miss from old the ray of sunshine (jk) (behind the bar ), to Kate the person that sat ius sat night who was super nice and helpful !

Everything you need for a nice dinner out in a local comfort establishment. They make you feel welcome. I'll be back ...."", 'On a Sunday it was packed and we were lucky to get a booth.  Its very loud inside and so there are a lot of raised voices with people trying to talk.  Sort of a true tavern of old, low ceiling probably adds to the noise.\nFamily style seating on the floor and booths on the outside perimeter. \nThe food was good, and tasty but I thought a little overcooked. But, these were sandwich entrees we tried. The salad was the best part of the meal it was fresh and dressed lightly just perfectly.  Service was a-ok.', ""We had dinner last night. I can't disagree more with the review of the brisket grilled cheese. The portion was large and it was delicious. My husband enjoyed the grilled cheese and I had the beet salad with salmon. The salmon was delicious and so was the salad. Our waitress was wonderful as well!"", 'We used to go to the Tavern all the time. Loved the atmosphere. When we knew it was being bought, we hoped that it would keep it\'s ""pub"" atmosphere and food. \nWe went not too long after it opened and it was OK but high priced and not a very good choice of ""pub"" meals. No real Lunch menu. \nYesterday my mother and I went for the first time since then. It was terrible. The high priced sandwiches were sparse with meat. My mother\'s roast beef was grayish and smelled old. My brother ate the remainder of it that we brought home and has had an upset stomach since. I had the brisket grilled cheese. Could have gotten better in a diner. My mom could have gotten a better roast beef at Arby\'s. \nA waste of a good deal of money. At least the beer was good!\nSo disappointed as it was a place we used to love to go.\nWe won\'t be back again.', 'I really really want to like this place. The location is five stars for me and the live music is also a plus. However the food (I have been three times) has never been more than a 1.5. The menu is excellent but the quality and execution of the food is just not there sadly. Hope they improve (quickly) before the place goes under yet again.', 'Dinner for three - 7:30 pm. First time here and disappointed in the menu. We are not particularly fussy, but there were no ""clean"" items on menu like unsaucy chicken or grilled fish. Heavy dishes with heavy sauces dominate. Decided to try the burger- but they were out of burgers. Huh?  Not ""I\'m so sorry but we have just served the last burger."" Just ""we are out."" Fall back to French Onion Soup, which was ok. Not great, just ok. Lobster Mac was really good and son\'s plate was practically licked clean. Pomme Frites were so bad that daughter wouldn\'t eat them. Ordered cheesesteak egg roll to share. Yuck- mushy meat and a cheesy sauce which really was not good. The place was packed, so other diners must have ordered better than we did. Service was adequate, not great, just ok. Not a restaurant we will visit again.', 'When you walk into this place, you\'ll see a dark, ugly restaurant.  You\'ll think, ""oh no, this is going to suck"". Ridiculous early American decor all over the place.  I guess they were trying to keep to the original tavern decor, but they shouldn\'t. I think it\'s so undesirable to sit and eat.  Some of the flooring is severely buckled and it\'s sooooo dark. UGH.  Not one penny was put into decor or ambience. HOWEVER, the food is delicious and very well done.  It\'s a shocker, I tell ya. Been there three times and was not disappointed. So consistent, which is a biggie.\nSo say yes to the Tavern, and you\'ll really enjoy if you are blind.', ""I came in with high expectations because this place is near and dear to my heart. I grew up here, my dad played music here, and Tommy was a good friend of my parents. It was our first time back since about 10 years ago, after they've reopened. ABSOLUTELY phenomenal. My stepdad had the crab cake sandwich, my mom had the Caesar salad, and I had the brisket grilled cheese. We went the first day of their fall menu, and it was a total hit. We basically fought over my grilled cheese, which was the best I've ever had. Waitstaff is super friendly. Highly recommend!"", ""WOW. This place blew me away. I had just gotten back from a trip to New Orleans so I didn't expect much when I ordered the jumbo crab cakes entree but WOW I was proved wrong!! \n\nORDER THE CRAB CAKES. They were the perfect texture and it was a very generous portion of two large crab cakes. The creamy sauce was amazing and tasted like heaven combined with the cooked spinach. The corn risotto was so so good with it as well. I was blown away by this dish!!!! They were the 3rd best crab cakes I've had. (SF and New Orleans is hard to compete with) \nI also split a Caesar salad with my bf and it was delicious. \n\nDidn't have the best wine selection but they had great beer. \n\nThe bartender forgot my cup of clam chowder but I wasn't charged so it was fine. I forgot about it anyways since I had the salad. \n\nGreat vibe inside, vintage tavern feel but classy. TVs at the bar. We left right before the live band was setting up. I will definitely be back!! I think this place deserves a better rating than what it has."", ""Wow what a major disappointment. It's been closed a few years and I was hoping a renovation and new ownership would make this a winner. In my book they really miss the mark in every way. Went this afternoon for lunch. They were serving brunch. Ok no worry I eat everything. First the new look is ok but it's very dark. That in itself is ok but we were sitting in a booth that the light was an open bulb which if cool but it's flickering. It did it though out the whole meal. My wife looked like a strobe light. Also a saxophonist-was playing hits from the 80's really loud. He was good but it was bizarre. The topper , there were little kids running around and screaming in the back dinning room. I believe they belonged to the owner. Restaurants are dangerous places for little kids plus they were really annoying . Watching a two year old tear into a kitchen full speed is frightening. I must be getting too old and grumpy. \n\nAre you sure you want to hear about the food . Ugh! It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Wife had short rib hash. Huge portion of potatoes covered with home made cheese wiz with soggy shredded short ribs, topped with two fried eggs. BTY my wife asked for them over easy. They were served sunny side up. I had fried chicken and waffles. Why it was topped with arugula is beyond me. Chicken was French cut and not crispy. Waffle was good but wasn't served with butter. The maple syrup was served ice cold. Really? No ice coffee. They did offer to pour hot coffee over ice for me. The server was very nice and knew the menu. The menu is solid but not if you can't execute it. I'm sure the owner will read this and be pissed at me for writing. Look in a mirror this is your business. I don't ever write reviews that are not fair. All this happened and I won't be back."", ""Went there Saturday day, December 1, 2018 @ 7 pm with reservations. On the reservation we requested the dining room instead of the bar. We arrived 25 early and it was mobbed! Couldn't get a seat at the bar. 15 minutes later we were told we were being seated in the bar! Can't say I was disappointed. We were seated in a corner booth (very private). The music was a blues band and they weren't half bad nor were they too loud that my wife and couldn't converse. Our drinks and appetizer came relatively quickly and it was very good (shrimp cocktail). Our waitress took our order and never checked back with us! About 25 minutes later the mean arrived (not served by our waitress). I asked for parmesan cheese but never saw her again! 10 minutes later OUR waitress came by and I asked Her for the cheese. 10 minutes later she came back with it. By now my seafood fro diabolo was warm at best. She disappeared AGAIN! I didn't finish my meal because it was lukewarm. We asked for coffee but no dessert. Coffees came 10 minutes later (seems to be their magic number)! She came back with the check (you guessed it 10 minutes later) and THEN hung around, in the area, until we paid it.\nEither they were understaffed or she wasn't that good.

So we ordered drinks, me a Bloody Mary and my friend a mimosa. My friend asked our server about the Riverhorse Raspberry Tripel and asked if it was an IPA. The server said, yes it was which is a complete lie. If you're unsure about something, don't lie about it, go ask someone who knows a thing or two about beer.\n\nThe food was mediocre, at best. We split the Chicken Club and Brisket Grilled Cheese and neither was anything to talk about. The fries that came with it were completely bland and unseasoned. You can get much better tasting, seasoned fries from the freezer section of any grocery store.\n\nIt's a shame, this space could be used for something great like a nice gastropub or small brewery but this is no where near close to being that.

Yes,Han Dynasty,3.5,301.0,1.0,"[""I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it."", ""The absolute WORST service EVER... which is so sad because the food really is delicious, but the service is seriously soooo bad it overshadows how good the food is. It's almost comical how AWFUL the service is at the Exton location... almost, like if it wasn't actually as bad as it it.

The lunch special is a steal for money and comes with a soup, main and rice. The hot and sour soup is really good and spicy. Wonton soup was a little bland and needed a decent helping of salt. The egg rolls are good and comes with a nice dipping sauce. Love the dan dan noodles. The noodles are good and the sauce is yum. The garlic chicken is also very good. Very mild in spice level and the sauce has a subtle hint of garlic. One dish I was really disappointed with was the fried dumplings. The dough is super thick and the dough to meat ratio is way off!! I couldn't taste the meat at all. This is the worst dumplings I've ever had and hence the 3 star. The only good part about it was the dipping sauce which was good. It's such a shame. I hope they change their dumplings. Apart from that rest of the dishes I tried there was good."", ""General tso's chicken was delicious probably best in the area. Big chunks of white chicken with light breading and a delicious spicy sauce. Reasonably priced."", 'Weirdest ""tangy tingly"" veggie lo mein ive ever had. Not sure how they cook it, but the lo mein actually had an after taste that tingled the mouth. Tried to wash it down with water and it intensified as if you drank water after using mouthwash. Definitely really odd. The general tsos was really good however, and was fresh with large chicken chunks. We lastly got the chicken and broccoli, which was really good as well. The place was clean, service was good, and prices were decent, but I just cant get over how odd the lo mein was, especially the after taste. I love lo mein but will never get it here again. Overall a good experience though.', ""If the service wasn't so slow this restaurant would have a perfect rating. The food just is on point with the authentic taste.

When placing my order, the waiter barely waited for me to finish, basically walking away to put it in so he could sit back behind the front counter on his phone. As a result, I ended up with white rice instead of pork fried rice, so I didn't really touch that part of my meal. \n\nThe egg drop soup was good and came out at a good temperature (not super hot but warm enough to enjoy) and my chicken and broccoli was cooked to my specification (I.e. steamed) and portions were plentiful. My egg roll was a tad spicier than I'm used too but still good. \n\nOur waiter was preoccupied with his phone the entire time we were there and we constantly had to get up and ask for things (sugar, another pot of tea, duck sauce, etc). It was pretty annoying since we were literally the only customers in the whole restaurant. \n\nAlthough prices were decent, service was not great (especially considering we were literally the only people in there eating). Food was adequate though."", ""We had a horrible dinner and experience here. First of all the restaurant was not full at all when we stopped there Monday. We were seated and sat for at least 20 minutes and no one came to wait on us. Another couple came in after we had been there and got waited on ahead of us. We stopped one of the servers who pretended not to understand English (how can you work in Exton, Pa and not understand clear English?) but finally we got a server. The food was just awful. I've never had food that salty in my life. I told the waiter it was horribly salty and he shook his head and left. Also the waiter who gave us our food was wearing a hoodie. That was so inappropriate to wear outside clothing serving food. Our food also was served on ice cold plates. Who puts hot food on cold plates? The double cooked chicken was horrible and tasted like a mouthful of SALT. The shrimp fried rice wasn't salty but not great  either because there were clumps of white rice throughout. The veggie rolls were the only thing we didn't dislike. I can't believe CNN endorses this place because It was the worst meal I ever had out.

Politics and Pork Lo Mein...I guess! \n\nFood : my friend and I got a vegetable egg roll, a pork egg roll, crispy cucumbers, the green beans and General tsos chicken. All dishes were pretty good. Sounds silly, but the green beans and cucumbers were the star of the show. Each dish was light, full of flavor yet still had some crisp.  $10 for beans seems a bit steep, but I thought they were delicious.  My friend liked his General Tsos but we agreed the portion was a bit small for the price. Both our rolls were uninspiring, lacking flavor.\n\nService: An energetic man was our server. I hope he was wearing a pedometer bc he may have broken 10k steps in the short period of time we were there.  Perhaps he was the delivery man, chef, hostess and the server?

Happy to say the pita(which is great and always fresh)does not fall apart. Falafel balls are perfectly seasoned. I usually get the classic sandwich(w hummus) and a side of babaganoush.

I didn't even realize they opened up a Mamoun's around here; the minute I did, I was full of glee and joy knowing that one of my absolute favorite Arab joints was opened near by.\nFULL DISCLAIMER: I'm Egyptian and I grew up living in a JC/NYC so Mamoun's (Macdougal) has a special place in my heart for being a little taste of the motherland and mama's cooking. \n\nI made a special lunch trip into the city of brotherly love for some Mamouns. HYPED it up to my co-workers and thankfully no one was in the mood for it since we typically get NAF NAF. I walked into a much larger space than that of Macdougal and Hoboken. Restaurant was very clean, open, and the staff was extremely nice. I choose a basic falafel sandwich (lunch special with a drink) and a small side of baba, $9 and change. A little more expensive than what I remember but whatever anything for a good falafel sandwich. \n\nWith complete and total excitement I took my first bite only to be extremely LET DOWN. There was no flavor. The sandwich looked great but failed all expectations of fulfilling a craving. At best this sandwich was 1-2 stars. Not worth the drive, not worth the type, not even worth it for lunch, honestly. I added hot sauce and some of my baba to the sandwich and meh. The baba tasted like nothing but the tahini sauce.... the garlicy, roasted eggplant flavor was nonexistent. \n\nSad to leave this review but somewhere across the state lines, this place lost connection to the original Mamoun's."", 'The first thing you should ask yourself is why is the falafel sandwich so cheap? Is it super small for $4.75? Why is there a $6 special in which you get a falafel sandwich and a juice of your choice? As my dad would say, what\'s the gimmick? What\'s the catch? Is the sandwich better than Goldie\'s? Or Mama\'s Vegetarian?\n\nThe sandwich is small, like a half-size Mama\'s Vegetarian and about the same size as a Goldie sandwich. It tastes closer to a Mama\'s Vegetarian sandwich than a Goldie sandwich. It\'s a little cheaper than a Mama\'s Vegetarian sandwich ($5.50) and the style is different from all three. From what I see, Mamoun\'s mashes their falafel balls to a pulp and presses it against one side of the pita bread like a layer or spread. The rest of the pita pocket is filled with lettuce, pieces of tomato, and a generous helping of tehina sauce. I don\'t think there was any cucumber in it. Each bite of my Mamoun\'s sandwich was loaded with flavor. Pure and simple ingredients. It just made me smile. \n\nI tried the hot sauce that was on the table, the one that warned ""Caution: Extremely hot. One drop at a time."" Spicy friends, this sauce does have a good kick to it. I did four drops.\n \nCompared to a Mama\'s Vegetarian sandwich, Mama\'s falafel are a little crisper, not mashed up in the sandwich, so Mama\'s sandwich is a little tougher to eat, especially if you want to get falafel in every bite. Since Mama\'s falafel is a bit crisper, it might be difficult to mash the falafel up into a spread. Mama\'s gives you cucumber as well as lettuce and tomato. Compared to Goldie\'s, well, hmmm.... Goldie\'s has better tasting falafel. Goldie\'s falafel are softer to the bite. It\'s almost like biting into lightly crisped raw foods protein balls (remember those?). Goldie\'s gives you more falafel than Mamoun\'s or Mama\'s half-size $5.50 sandwich, but... Goldie\'s falafel are tiny, so it\'s about the same amount of falafel. Goldie\'s sandwich tastes good, perhaps even great, but it\'s overpriced at $8.\n\n[Side note: What the hell was Goldie thinking making a falafel sandwich $8? This is supposed to be street food! Not street food for trust fund babies! Oh, wait... this is a falafoodie sandwich!]\n\nBack to the comparisons, Mama\'s has the best bread, especially when you get it warm out of the oven. Jesus, it\'s good! (Oops! there\'s my church influence!) Goldie\'s bread is good, too, but not pillowy soft like Mama\'s. Mamoun\'s bread is okay. It\'s more like store bought than homemade. Of the three, for overall value, I think Mamoun\'s is the best. It edges past Mama\'s a little. You can\'t go wrong with either one, especially if you live on one end of town or the other. Goldie\'s is about five blocks away from Mama\'s. If you have extra money that you don\'t want to put into your new Mercedes, try a Goldie\'s sandwich, otherwise go for a Mama\'s sandwich if you\'re west of Broad and Mamoun\'s if you\'re east. For pure, unadulterated bite-after-bite falafel, go with Mamoun\'s.\n\nOh, yeah, and the juice is good, too.', ""I got a shawarma platter to go with salad. Came home to find a sloppy, soggy mess of salad drowning in dressing/sauce. The meat itself was not much in quantity and tasted nothing spectacular (I have good memories of the chicken shawarma here). I wouldn't want to spend $12+ for food put together so carelessly. I've been having a bad time with ordering food in Philly lately, probably a sign to stop experimenting. \n\nThe pita was warm and gets one extra star.\n\nP.S. - like many have said, the red sauce can kill. Touch/sample at your own risk."", 'I tried all the proteins in the menu - chicken, the lamb in shawarma and falafel. Everything tasted overcooked and burnt.

Very reasonably priced.', ""Woohoo!  I was introduced to Mamoun's in NYC, then made some visits to the Princeton location, and now they've made their landing in Philly!  Had the falafel plate, which was tasty as ever.  I added a side of hummus to help break up the flavors and textures with the rice.  The interior is not as large as the Princeton location but there is still seating to be found (can't say the same for the NYC spot).  I appreciate how their sides menu indicates whether items are gluten free or not.  I did not see likewise for the main entrees - not sure if it was an afterthought or if the mains are free of gluten as well.  I can't find definitive answers searching online so hopefully they address that."", ""I used to go to the original location in NYC all the time prior to moving so I was excited to see a Mamoun's open up in Philadelphia!

I would come back if I was in the area. The restaurant is clean with plenty of seating so it's great for groups."", 'Taste alone, this place disappointed sorely. Staff and fast casual restaurant was fine. I love Shawarma and falafel. We arrived around 11:15am before the ""lunch rush"" (hint: it never actually arrived). I ordered the shawarma plate and my co-worker got the gyro version. Neither of us liked our food. Usually I\'m particular about not wasting any food. Even though it\'s not super photogenic, I\'d say it still looks much better than it tastes. The meat had some unusual bitter spice smothered in the creamy sauce. The pickled veggies were just sour without much appeal. Then the hot sauce it is straight up just HEAT -- very bitter aftertaste. \n\nMaybe the namesake falafels are a better choice if we have to return?', 'I was tempted to go 4-stars here and I still may come around if I eat here again (something I\'m willing to do). I had a Mcdougal Sandwich, which is basically a pita sandwich with both falafel and shawarma. My girlfriend got a basic falafel sandwich and we split an order of fries with garlic sauce.\n\nI started out very happy with the my sandwich - the lamb shawarma meat surprised me with how flavorful and ""real"" it tasted. And by and large I enjoyed the sandwich. As I went on, though, I noted that the falafel was taking a serious backseat to the lamb and the lettuce/tomato - there were I think two balls in there, but their presence in the taste and texture was minimal. My girlfriend somewhat similarly felt that there was a disproportionate amount of lettuce and tomato (as well as disappointed that the place doesn\'t seem to offer cucumber with any dishes), somewhat at the expense of the falafel. \n\nThe fries also elicited mixed feelings. Make no mistake - they taste exactly like I wanted them to. They were lightly seasoned and a perfect mix of outwardly crisp and internally billowy. But at $4.55, the portion was way too small - we would not have split them had we known how few you get...but we also would\'t have spent $9+ on two small bags of french fries, so damned if you do, damned if you don\'t there. The garlic sauce was a letdown, too - more than tasting garlicky, it was salty enough to choke a horse. It worked out because they tasted great alone and with ketchup, but the garlic sauce was disappointing. \n\nThere\'s still a lot that looks great on the menu, and the quality of the lamb and fries suggests to me that, say, the chicken kabob plate, falafel plate, or kafta kebob sandwich might be absolutely delicious.

It\'s just a matter of preference, and I like Rocky\'s for stromboli. But all in all, this place doesn\'t deserve the bad reviews as far as food goes.

First time at a Red Robin - kept seeing commercials on tv and decided to give it a try while visiting family in PA.  When we arrived around 7:30 pm on Friday night it was crowded!  Good sign I am thinking -- it must be good!  The hostesses told our party of 3 that it would be a 5 - 15 minute wait.  Once we were seated, our server came over rather quickly with menus and asked for our drink orders and welcomed us and asked if we had ever eaten at Red Robin before.  I told her ""no, it\'s our first time.""  I could have told her anything and she wouldn\'t have cared I am convinced.  You would have thought she would have explained the menu or the bottemless fries but, nope blank stare.  I said to her that we would take a few minutes to look over the menu.  Once she came back, we placed our order and starving!  No offer of an appetizer or basket of fries.  When our food arrived - reasonably timing considering how busy they were - she dropped them off and asked how everything was.  DUH.  I gave her the blank stare, bit my tongue, counted to 5, and said ""well, you are just dropping the burgers off and we haven\'t even tried them but, we will let you know.""  (CLUELESS).  Didn\'t phase her at all.  She walked away.  As we were waiting for napkins and silverware 5 minutes, 6 minutes, 7 minutes, -- we just started to eat.  Messy and pretty tasty - you know you\'ve gotten a good burger - I got up to go to the waitstaff station to ask 2 servers (not our server) for napkins and silverware.  One said ""oh sure, where are you sitting?""  We were literally sitting right in front of the waitstaff station and I said right here and went to stand by my table.  AND I stood there - they walked away.  Still no napkins or silverware.   I then walked to another waitstaff station mid way through the restaurant. There were 3 servers standing there.  I asked for napkins and silverware.  They looked at me like I had asked to take the keys to their car and go buy some napkins and silverware at the grocery store down the street.  Then one of them asked how many I needed and when I said for 3 people, he laughed and said ""ok, that will be $5)  HAHA - I am now thinking I am not here for stand up comedy night just give me the napkins and silverware and no one gets hurt.  Lucky for me, a 4th server walks up and thank God, this guy understood customer service and how to get a tip because he offered to bring the napkins and silverware to our table.  We never saw our original server - she didn\'t come back to check on us, offer us those bottemless fries, more drinks, NOTHING.  I hit that nifty little box on our table to get her back to our table and she showed up about 8 minutes later.  I asked if we could have more fries.  She said she\'d get them and walked away.  5 minutes, 6 minutes, 7 minutes, 8 minutes, 9 minutes.  Are you kidding me???? You\'re a burger and fry joint and it is taking this long for some fries.  You offer bottemless fries or so your commercials say that.  Our server certainly didn\'t offer that but I saw other servers offering to the tables around us.  Our server had a table of 4 next to us and they left shortly after we got our food and she never even cleared their table.  I decided to call our Server back to the table and I told her we would just take the check (I was nice the entire time -- I know my review is sounding a bit salty but, I was all sugar to this server).  She brought the check up on that little box on our table and I had a $25 gift card that I used and then owed $15 more.  She left the receipts, gift card, my credit card at the opposite end of the table and I had to reach over to get it to sign.  WHY was she ever hired?  I gave zero tip.  Yep, ZERO tip.  It was the absolute worst service I have ever received in dining out.  When we were leaving, I asked to speak to the manager.  After explaining the service situation to him and that it was our very first time eating at a Red Robin and most likely would be our last given the awful service (after 2 minutes of speaking with him I knew WHY she was hired . . . the same CLUELESS signs from him)   Facepalm.  God help me, please.  He just kept asking where were you sitting and did we eat??? (Yes, I told you 3 times where we were sitting and that we ate) Then he said ""I am sorry.""  That\'s it!  It\'s a wrap here folks.    He doesn\'t care that it\'s our first time or last time.

I was kind of annoyed because even though I just removed the buns and ate the burger a lot of the sauces had seeped into the bread.  And this burger really needed the sauce.  This was the most burnt, driest burger I have EVER eaten...it was well done and then some.  I couldn't even eat the ends because they were rubbery.  My fiance's was the same exact way so I guess that's how they cook all their burgers.  The fries are ok but I also prefer them crispy and that's really hard to do with thick steak fries.\n\nAll in all, this was a bad experience and not even worth the $14 plus tip we spent on lunch.  Won't be back to this Red Robin."", ""update, 10 Aug 2018\n\nWe went to lunch, and the place was close to empty (two tables, 6 covers total). My wife had a chicken sandwich and root-beer float.

The service and management of this restaurant is so bad another waitress came over to explain the other waitress was embarrassed to come speak to us. Finally received our dinners only to send back because meatballs were pink and undercooked. My meal was a pasta with sweet sausage, peppers and onions special. I requested  hot sausage which the waitress said no problem. My dinner was served with the sweet sausage and the peppers were not even cooked. Onions were sautéed nicely, however the peppers were raw to the point where we all agreed they just added them to the dish before service. Read other posts and you will see similar complaints about undercooked food from kitchen. At this point it was 7:30 and we just wanted to leave. Cashier offered us a free canoli to take home because of our experience.

I don't think I have been through Phoenixville, but Majolica is on the main strip that goes through the heart of town, with a relatively unassuming sign in elegant script hanging over the entrance. Once inside, you feel like you're in a cozy townhouse, as the layout very much resembles one. There are a few tables in the front and some more towards the back, but there's decent spacing, and while the volume's never that loud, you can carry on your own conversations quite easily. Our server was an earnest gentleman who made sure our food came out at a leisurely pace and let us know the one time it didn't (which was dessert). This is a BYOB spot, so bring your booze with you if you'd like to drink - otherwise it'll just be water for you (which is what we had).\n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward; there are starters, mains, and desserts. We first got a bite from the kitchen as an amuse bouche - a crispy truffled potato chip with freshly-cut raw tuna on it - very good and a promising start to the meal. The rosemary bread with olive oil was solid, although the presence of the herb in the bread was inconsistent at best (but good nonetheless). We then shared a number of appetizers across the table, with the best by far being the lamb tartare with a quail egg cracked on top, with a helping of finely-shaved cheese on the side. My experiences with lamb tartare have usually been a bit inconsistent, but it was really good here - partially due to the fact that the slight gaminess of the meat was not as forward as in others, and the egg really blended in well. We also had grilled sardines (the full fish) - pretty well-executed overall, although the fish was a tad on the drier side. Where the execution failed most notably was on the grilled octopus, which was cooked to that middle you want to avoid - hard enough on the outside but with that rubbery chew in the middle. It was edible, but that was the clear weak link among the starters.\n\nThe entrees, though, were very good overall. My porchetta roast was delicious, and while the meat inside the skin could have been a little more moist, that aromatic meaty flavor was on-point, and I really enjoyed the mustard seeds generously dolloped on top. The skin was perfectly crispy as well, and the beans were an okay (and filling) side. My wife's duck breast was also cooked really well - perfectly at medium-rare and with a slight hint of sweetness to each bite. I would say that my father in-law's dish was perhaps the most unimaginative - a filet of dorade atop a bed of fennel (a bit of a plain/odd combo) - but it was still decently-prepared. We then ended the meal, in a slightly-delayed fashion (as aforementioned) with a couple sweets. The spiced donuts were not really all that spicy, and the 'creme de pots' was a bit of an odd choice as an accompaniment, as it is more pudding-like in its texture than a dip. The other dessert, though, was fantastic - a pineapple sorbet served atop fruit and a lot of tapioca. It reminded me a bit of Gramercy Tavern's classic dessert at the end of its tasting menu in a favorable way.\n\nIn all, I came away filled - and pleasantly surprised by the dinner I had here. It's not the absolute best food I've eaten, but the quality and the quantity at the price point are absolutely great. I'd definitely come back to eat here again whenever I'm in these parts!"", ""My husband took me here for my birthday last summer. I had heard good things so I was excited (especially because it was BYOB). Well, it lived up to it's expectations and more. I legit haven't stopped thinking about this restaurant since August. It was so delicious- from the sweet bread appetizer, to the duck breast entree to the chocolate mousse dessert, I just want it all again. It's definitely not a cheap date night but it's so worth it. I would love to try the tasting menu next time I go. But do yourself a favor and go here if you are a true foodie."", ""We have been coming here for about 10 years.  We heard it was closing so thought the best thing to do was to have a meal or 2 before it's all over.\n\nThis place is particularly good because of the servers who are basically professionals - not just college kids. \n\nThe food is always very special and there are some great options.  It's great to hear how chef thinks the food should be cooked - ie. medium/rare etc.\n\nThis visit I did the radicchio salad, the petite filet and the doughnuts.  \n\nThe radicchio was great - could have had a tiny but more bacon for my taste.  The petit filet itself was amazing - the sauce was extraordinary.  As to the potatoes though they were slightly undercooked.  I am a potato aficionado so I am confident in that assessment.  The doughnuts though are the clincher.  It's getting easier these days to get fresh doughnuts but not with a coffee cream side with them.\n\nIt will be sad when Phoenixville loses its best small restaurant.  It nice to have choices that aren't taproom breweries or larger experiences.  I hope someone takes on the lease of the space and tries to make this work."", ""We came to Majolica based on the reviews we read so it's only fair to pass along the great news! \nThis place is a must in the Pheonixville area!!!\nWe brought a couple bottles of wine as it is a BYOB, which is the best of both worlds--spend more on good food instead of expensive drinks. The food though is out of this world! The chef special was a tuna tartare on a chip and it just melted in your mouth. DELICIOUS! I also had a special that night; the soft shell crap BLT, which I had never had before ando was a little weary at first but it was the best decision of the night. My wife's lobster bisque was also a home run with great flavors! Thanks chefs and owner of Majolica for great food!"", ""A great place, but time is running out - they close in December!\n\nSo, after putting off going here for literally years, I finally managed to get serious about it once I got word they are opening to close up shop in December. Too bad, because the place is pretty good!\n\nStarted off with the Maine mussels, lobster corn chowder, and smoked salmon. Salmon was decent, very fresh and sweet. The corn chowder was rich, but no, it's not a sharable portion (unless you don't eat much). The mussels are plentiful, and unlike most mussels in this area, HUGE. The benefit of Maine mussels. Both the chowder and mussels were great!\n\nMains! On, so the pasta was amazing! Light and fluffy, filled to capacity, in a delicious sauce. The duck meal looked a bit weird, since it's covered in leeks, but it was cooked perfectly and tasted great!\n\nDessert! Both the donuts and truffle are amazing. Order them for appetizers, then again at dessert, they're that good!\n\nService was tremendously friendly, and very prompt and attentive. It's a BYO, and fyi, if you choose to put your wine on ice (if applicable), they'll put it in a communal ice bucket and come by frequently to top you off. A little unconventional, but it works well.\n\nAll in all, a great place! Get in there before they close!"", ""This is a great restaurant in the heart of Pheonixville. The food was exceptionally executed and the atmosphere was great for date night.

Menu is diverse enough for anyone to find something they like, but not so exhaustive as to dilute the quality and presentation of each dish.

I so recommend that you add the chili's heat if you are getting CORN or AVACADO or any chocolate because it just makes the sweetness so much better.\n\nOne of our group went the sundae route and she was totally happy using her finger to get the last of the sauce from the cup.\n\nSo my family's advice ... especially on any hot day ... if you are going to LONGWOOD make sure you are also going for ice cream 10 minutes down the road at La Michoacana!

If they didn't have an outdoor seating patio I probably wouldn't of ever came here."", ""Was here on Saturday afternoon after walking around town wanted a quick bite to eat and this place had no wait time and roof top seating. The inside is very nice but the rooftop deck on a beautiful day sealed this choice. The people were very friendly and our waitress was very attentive  So now to the food its a typical burger, pizza and sandwich place. My son had the chicken parm burger which I grabbed a bite and was very tasty. I had the gyro in which was a boring choice but that's on me not the place. My wife had cheesesteak egg rolls from the small plate selection, I also grabbed a bite of that and they were very tasty. We order the buffalo chicken dip and that came with soft warm pita strips the dip was very spicy, that's a plus for me. Overall I would give this place 3.5 stars but if a larger selection and probably would of rated it higher if I wasn't disappointed with my selection."", ""Cool looking restaurant. Sat upstairs on the outdoor patio on a gorgeous evening and had a lovely view of the iconic Market Street sign. Service was prompt. Only complaint was the buffalo chicken pizza. I've ordered this many places and it usually has individual, boneless chunks of chicken and some type of buffalo sauce. It seems all they do here is dump their buffalo chicken dip on top of the pizza. It was ok, but not really what I was expecting."", 'I had a great experience at this restaurant, my girlfriend and I walked in and asked for a table at the outdoor patio upstairs. They said it would be a half hour wait, it ended up being only about 20 minutes. We got seated and our server was very attentive, we got drinks right away and our appetizer. My margarita pizza was superb, only downside was that my girlfriend got a cheeseburger and the one end of the bun was burnt. I recommend this place and would gladly go back.', 'I was kind of disappointed not going to lie. I experienced the opposite of the reviews. \nWe went with a larger group so not sure if that somehow made the experience worse. I understand it gets busy was waiters and that its hard to serve a large crowd but the waiter we had was extremely impatient. A few of us arrived maybe 5 minutes after the rest of the party and we asked the waiter to give us a few minutes to decide. Not even 5 minutes, he returns asking us ""Ladies are you ready?"". My friend and I ordered whatever our eyes landed on and my other friend ordered a grilled cheese only because he pulled the menu out of her hand before she could read anything else. \nMy friends who came before us had ordered plethora of small plates. The buffalo chicken dip was pretty decent, however I wasn\'t a huge fan of the pita bread. I get that its their thing, but it was an odd combo. The mac&cheese was okay, it looked like they skimped out on the potato chip crumble on top. The pesto hummus was decent again, nothing special. The chicken bombs were a meh, it was like chicken wings except they pulled the meat down so that the bone was exposed like a lollipop. For the main meal I got the chicken parm burger and that was a let down. The chicken parm wasn\'t the classically crispy chicken patty that you\'d expect but it was just a plain chicken patty with no breading encased in pita bread with with melted mozzarella and marinara. Not super great. The fries that came out were limp and they weren\'t meant to be shoelace fries either. \n\nI didn\'t try the pizza but it looked a lot better than most things we had. Maybe this place needs to be tried again during happy hour but from this experience trying a lot of things from the menu, I can only give it 2 stars.', ""While the food and ambience was good, our service was not. We went to the Revolution House to have pizza and a salad for lunch only to be told that we could not order pizza because the oven was being cleaned. Shortly after our order was rejected we saw numerous pizzas being served to other patrons. Our beer sat in the sun at the rooftop bar for at least 10 minutes while our waiter walked past it numerous times. Finally, it was delivered warm. There were no utensils on our table and we had to ask the water server for them after our food was delivered. After waiting several minutes, we got up and found them on our own in a basket on the table next to us. We would have had another drink but none were offered. Not sure why our server was so inadequate, he certainly didn't seem too busy. He was friendly when we saw him. Lol While our server was not accommodating, I would go back to try the pizza if we lived in the area. The eggplant was yummy."", 'A late May happy hour visit include the generous Buffalo Dip (with pita) for $5.00.

I should say this was the upstairs bar and this was  the female bartender.  Maybe she was having a bad day I thought?  We took our drinks with us outside to the outside patio and after a while I glance up to see the bartender was now all smiles and laughs with her co worker.  Glad her day got better, perhaps she'll treat the next customer nicer.

He made suggestions and waited patiently for me to decided on a drink.  From there, everything looked up.\n\nThree of the four of us got the flatbead burger.  I was hesitant but I really liked it.  We all did.  My other friend got a chicken parm flatbread and also liked it.

Very short with her responses, no eye contact, poor service in general.', ""This was a great find. We sat on the upper deck and enjoyed some apps and a few drinks. There's a beautiful view of the ben franklin. Big stairs, so if you can't walk up a big flight, I don't recommend sitting upstairs. The tater tots were clearly home-made and that was awesome. The hummus pesto was great with the pita bread. Very flavorful. Some negatives about the place were the lack of apps- they were out of 3 but the waiter told us immediately, so we didn't get our hopes up. The staff was attentive but they didn't bring out silverware until we asked, and even with ordering appetizers, I thought was a little odd. Overall, great place and I'll be back when I'm in old city, especially with the proximity to franklin fountain."", ""We were starving walking around Old City and we stumbled upon Revolution House. We liked the variety of the menu, so we thought we'd give it a try. What a pleasant surprise, great food and service! We tried the buffalo chicken pizza and the pork belly A-BLT. First, the Neapolitan pizza, the crust had a great texture and was so light and tasty - even the crust with no cheese or topping was delicious  - and the buffalo chicken topping was good as well. Then came the avocado BLT, I have to say pork belly instead of bacon is more than perfect - succulent, flavorful, and not greasy at all. Service from Kevin was very friendly. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Old City, in fact I know I have to try the margherita pizza the next time."", 'This place is awesome! Went with a group of 8 people at 7pm on Saturday. We were seated immediately and had a great table on the patio (they close it in and have heaters and string lights in the winter, so the ambience was great inside & out). \n\nThe food was spectacular and I had every intention of taking pics - but got so excited by the food that I forgot! They had some fun new additions to the menu. We tried a ton of stuff, and hands down our favorite dishes were the mushroom arancini and the short rib risotto. The risotto in both dishes is just insanely good! Another group fav was the tuna tartare, which had a creamy wasabi flavor. The fig pizza was unique and super flavorful. My only critique was the craft beer menu was slightly lacking.\n\nGood service and great location. We will be back!', ""We came here to celebrate a coworker's birthday, and were very disappointed with the service. We put in our order at 12:05-12:10pm, and the first two dishes didn't come out until 12:30-12:35. Then three other dishes came out around 12:45. The the last dish we ordered came at 12:50, right before we needed to leave. This last dish was supposed to be ordered GF/without bread, but it came out on a piece of bread and we had to send it back. \n\nThankfully, the waitress took off a drink and meal from our bill, but we will still greatly underwhelmed with the service and customer experience.\n \nThe food was good, but not worth the unfortunate service. \n\nWould love to see the restaurant work on this aspect of their business, because the location and interior is very promising. What a bummer!"", ""Suffice it to say, I will never be back here again.  The staff were poorly trained and the food inedible.  The concept of investing in a space that creates invitational warmth and return is devoid on this poor excuse of an establishment.  If you are looking for a comfortable relaxed setting to enjoy a drink and a bite with friends, you're much better off foregoing the ill served rooftop and staying streetside at the Continental across the street or down the street at the beautiful bar at Fork."", ""Though I feel like the menu is somewhat limited, I have never had a bad experience here and I have never gotten anything I didn't like. I also appreciate and enjoy the decor and overall atmosphere, especially on the rooftop dining patio in the summer. Selfishly, I'm primarily writing this review to rave about the Eggplant sandwich. It is by far one of my favorite sandwiches in Philadelphia and I hope it never goes away! I have driven all the way from Point Breeze in the past just to pick it up :) Keep doing what you're doing!"", ""I came to Revolution House on a Thursday night with my coworkers. We were able to get a reservation for 12, but we probably didn't need it because the restaurant wasn't that busy. We were seated on the upstairs patio, which was very nice and have us a view of Penn's Landing and the Ben Franklin bridge. \n\nI really enjoyed the restaurant's aesthetics and the view, but the food was mediocre. We ordered the tater tots, guacamole, and buffalo chicken dip for the table. Out of the three, the tater tots were my favorite. They are made with a mix of regular potato, sweet potato, and cheese, but they weren't anything special. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken special, which came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The chicken was juicy, the green beans were average, and the potatoes were very buttery, but kind of tasted like boxed mashed potatoes. All in all, the food did not impress me. This a good place to bring out of town folks when the weather is nice because of the patio area, but otherwise, I would not come back."", ""The deck caught our attention as we were strolling Olde City in search of a quick, late night bite & drink. Ordering drinks were easy, I had the Turn of the Tide which was pretty good. My friend had a simple Alagash White (which is one of the only beers that I actually like). When it came to the menu, nothing really popped out at us. We sampled he flatbread & it was more like a pita than flat. We ordered the tater tots and firecracker shrimp. You really couldn't go wrong with either. They were ok. We really liked the ambience and view from the deck. It was a great summer weeknight & the streets weren't too busy. I'd love to experience this place during the day, perhaps for brunch or happy hour. I think it has potential, we just stumbled in on a quiet, slow night."", ""This is a cute little spot to stop for a quick and causal brunch if you're in the area.

It was after 12 and I have a rule about booze before 12 and eggs after 12 so I had a cheesesteak with beer. The cheesesteak was served as a flatbread. The bread was fresh, cheese melted well inside with onion and nice sirloin shredded, along with some smoked mozzarella which had a light smoke flavor. The fries were decent and the beer was fresh. It was a Can-O-Bliss from Oskar Blues, def a fresh keg, nice and citrusy, clean pour and glass. Thank you for cleaning your beer lines! \n\nI was happy with my experience here.

I literally had more offers to get my cup refilled with tap water than I would think of doing at my own home. You\'re truly well looked after here.\n\nThe menu is at first glance somewhat limited. However Emily went with a flat bread style sandwich and it was truly filling. It came stacked with protein and was encased both at the top and bottom. \n\nI went with buffalo chicken dip and I can\'t say I was disappointed. You\'ll get a generous serving of what is obviously slow cooked pulled chicken that is matched with a delicious serving of pita type bread. It was a meal and a half in and of itself.\n\nOverall I would certainly return. It\'s a little too pricey for me to come frequently but we made out well leaving work a $30 check to settle.

The terrace overlooks Penny's Lansing and made for a great atmosphere, paired with attentive and quick service. The waitstaff was notably great in offering recommendations, explaining portion sizes, and refilling drinks.

If you're looking for an upgrade but the $5 to add chicken feels like a little much, and it did, the hard boiled egg was a good addition to the salad."", 'The location of this restaurant is so ideal. It is one of my go to spots in old city for drinks and small plates with friends! The atmosphere is very cozy but the upstairs deck/porch is my favorite in the spring and summertime when everything opens up. Prices are super reasonable which is always a plus.

I take everyone here because they never disappoint!! LOVE friendly staff, great atmosphere. 5/5!', ""If I could break it down, I would give an easy full five stars for the phenomenal service and experience, four stars for the ambiance, and three stars for the food (averaging out to a four). \n\nWe came for a friend's birthday dinner on a Wed evening, and enjoyed a lovely time up on the outdoor-but-covered rooftop bar. Our server (shoot I forgot his name because I'm not writing this review in a timely fashion) was excellent in accommodating us in so many ways that it really helped create a wonderful evening experience! Really can't emphasize enough how friendly and attentive he was!\n\nI would give this place five stars but I wasn't particularly impressed with the food. It wasn't bad but I didn't enjoy my goat cheese, beet, pasta salad as much as I had anticipated because it was prepared very differently than I would have imagined; the goat cheese was inside pasta bits that were kind of more of a tough consistency to chew on. I tried some of my friend's tater tots, which was actually very delicious because it had melted cheese inside. However, she hadn't been aware of the cheese inside because it didn't say on the menu and she doesn't eat dairy so it wasn't a pleasant surprise for her (even though it was a treat for the rest of the table as she shared it with us). \n\nThe interior is beautiful though, and I loved their clean yet rustic styled bathroom.

Oh, did I mention that the exterior is rather unassuming (major understatement)? The pale, slightly water-stained and unadorned concrete which hides the original brick facade is accompanied by plain, flat brown doors and windows. It hides a bright and beautifully reclaimed interior...and if you look up, you\'ll see the building also is home to a beautiful open second story patio.\n\nDrinks: Full bar with decent domestic and imported wines by glass and bottle, some whiskeys, and a mix of great craft brews, plus bottles and cans of standard swill. (Actually, the entire list is pretty good!)\n\nFood: Like the decor (check out the web site and photos for more details--we missed a few) the menu offerings are an hodge-podge with no distinct theme. The selections range from Quinoa Salad to Mac and Cheese to Cheesesteak Egg Roll starters, from Flatbread sammies and Gyros to Jerk Salmon plates and Pizza. Got the idea?\n\nWe picked a good hoppy IPA to accompany our Margherita Pizza. The crust was crisp and brown on the bottom (our friends thought it burned...but not us). We thought it was just right; it was topped with a decent sauce and quite a lot of cheese. To my liking, it also had a chewy Neapolitan-style ""corniccione"" (raised outer edge). All in all good but not outstanding pizza.\n\nFriends ordered and enjoyed the hearty black bean chili (a special) and shared (a bit soggy) fried eggplant flatbread sandwich with a side salad. Both were ok...but texture of the sandwich was a bit mushy; no evidence of ""fried.""\n\nTake time to walk around the interior, and hopefully appreciate the effort that went into redoing this place.

The grilled cheese is amazing, but so is all of the food, I can't say a bad thing about it. \n   More recently, a few of us went here for dinner and asked if they were seating outside. They said yes and happily took us to our table outside on the sidewalk. 30 minutes pass and not a single person approaches us, all while workers walked by us inside not stopping or making a single effort to serve us. So we left and went next door to marmont, which was great. Unfortunately, the bad left a BAD taste in our mouths.

I picked this place mainly for the rooftop bar - it's a beautiful space that overlooks penn's landing and as it had a roof and sliding shutters that could roll down in the case of rain, my party was kept dry even when it started thunderstorming.\n\nIn terms of food, it was good but nothing special. My friend and I shared the peach, pastrami, and goat cheese pizza. The flavors were good (although I wish there were more peaches) but it wasn't a pizza that blew me out of the water. Also, please be aware that the tots that come on the side are filled with cheese (to my utter delight and friend's horror - she hates cheese) so keep that in mind when ordering sides. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience.

Avocado was also a great accompaniment. I heard great things about the veggie burger and mac and cheese, and I had some of the best calamari I've ever had in Philly. \n\nFrench fries came in a huge bowl, obviously freshly cut and fried perfectly! Didn't like the shrimp rolls particularly, not very crispy but weren't bad. Overall, this spread impressed me and I'd come back for some appetizers with friends, and the beers are average prices too.

Old City is really my favorite part of Philly so almost every place there I tend to love. This honestly might be one of the best renovated and decorated places that I have been to in Old City. They did such a great job of keeping some of the cooler parts of the building like the fireplace on the steps and the exposed brick walls and incorporating modern touches like the see through metal grate steps.\n\nEnough about the decor which I could keep going on about, the food although very scatter shot items was very good. The brick oven pizza we got was perfect with a nice doughy crust and the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. We also got the Mac & Cheese which was really good with a chip crust on it and the cheesesteak egg rolls which were the first ones I've ever had that actually tasted like a cheesesteak.

Haven't seen a lot of the same people over time - might have a high turnover. Water glasses stay full for the most part.\n\n5. Love the roof deck - in summer and covered in cooler months!\n\n6.

Mind you, three servers were standing nearby hanging out by the bar doing nothing. \n\nThe bartender left halfway through our dinner without saying anything, so I had to ask a server who was walking by who our new server was.

This was probably the main reason we came here instead of other brunch/ lunch places in the area. It was fabulous weather so it was nice looking out at the ambiance. \n\nWe ordered the wedge salad, pepperoni pizza, and pesto hummus. The salad a pizza were very good and I would eat those items again. The pesto hummus was a big miss. There was no hummus consistency at all. I don't even think it was made with chick peas. I'm pretty sure they just gave us a cup of pesto sauce but the menu clearly said pesto hummus.

This place is right across the street from Penns Landing so it makes for a great pre bb&t concert food spot. Eat hope on the fairy and have a great time! \n\nWe'll definitely be back!"", ""This spot is an old favorite, but I often forget about it - at 2nd and Market, its deep in old city and a bit of a distance for a lot of center city dwellers.  Still, the 2nd floor deck is worth the trip for beautiful days when you can't stand the idea of jostling with 300 other folks at Independence Beer Garden. \n\nThey offer 1/2 off a bunch of their drafts during happy hour, which means you get to try cool beers and decent discounts.  Their margherita pizza is also 1/2 off, and its wood fired and pretty delicious."", ""I enjoyed my experience here, however, my friend not so much. The hostess and waitress were both friendly as we arrived and were seated. The place wasn't too crowded and our waitress was patient with us. \n\nMy favorite part is the homemade tator tots. They are delicious. I would definitely suggest getting them if you come here. For my meal, I got a veggie burger and instead of a bun it came out on a pita looking thing. At first I thought that was weird, but to my surprise I ended up liking it a lot more than a bun. It allows you to actually enjoy the burger. Also you don't have to worry about the bun being too thick or too dry. This is something I'd actually prefer going forward! The fries and dipping sauces were also good\n\nMy friend ordered Mac and cheese which neither one of us really liked. It was a bit watery and very lacking in flavor. It could've used a lot more seasoning and a lot more cheese. It didn't taste very cheesy and didn't have that cheesy texture. I wouldn't order this again but I'd come for the other food.""]","[5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0]",61,3.704918032786886,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes,Holiday Inn Express & Suites - West Chester,2.5,17.0,1.0,"['I recently stayed here, breakfast was awesome. A week after checking out I found an additional charge on my credit card. After calling and speaking to the managet-he informed me it was a smoking charge. I did not ever smoke in my room, yes I am a smoker but spent most of waking hours in my vehicle. Fraudulent charging. I have no recourse except reporting here. Beware if your clothing smells of smoke!!', ""We stayed in this hotel few times during the last few years. We liked our first couple of stays, but with each next coming stay saw clear degradation of the services, management and conditions of rooms as well as common areas. This time it was plain awful.\nFRONT DESK: no welcoming smile, nonalignment of the IHG membership, total ignorance to the needs of the customer. I am talking about person named Rocco whom we dealt with. This person doesn't have any clue about proper customer service and working in hospitality industry. But his supervisor Gwendolyn Mckoy wasn't really much better, and though after the conversation about our stay at check out seemingly was acknowledging our concerns and complains (even offered a refund or give rewards points for our inconveniences). But in reality after more then a week we are still waiting for any points related to this stay.\nCLEANLINESS: VERY, VERY questionable. The linens looked badly laundered and not fresh at all. The room was smelly and even vacuuming with carpet freshener didn't help much. The bath tub wasn't properly cleaned for a simple reason: as we discovered next morning taking a shower the drainage hardly worked, so we were standing in the dirty water up to our ankles. The shower head and tap was leaking heavily and water pressure was poor. The efficiency of the housekeeping staff is poor. At 2:30pm we observed them happily chatting in stead of cleaning in spite of the deficit of the rooms availability for check in we've experienced ourselves.\nBREAKFAST: the area was dirty, the quality and quantity of the food was poor. Pancake machine wasn't working. Supplying of hot food was slow.\nMANAGEMENT: VERY POOR. Even when I've tried couple of times to address my concerns by calling to General manager Manjunath Tumkur Vasudev could not go through the repeating over and over automatic massages.\nNo doubt it was our last stay in this dreadful place, but I hope I'll save lot's if aggravation to many people who'll read this review and decide to skip this place either.""]","[2.0, 1.0]",2,1.5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
