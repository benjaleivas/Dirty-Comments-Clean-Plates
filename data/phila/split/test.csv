We had our own entrees which included the Smoked Chicken Pot Pie (bacon, oyster mushrooms, carrot, biscuit), Mushroom and Brussel Sprouts flatbread (wild mushroom, truffle, cheddar), Shrimp and Grits (crispy pork belly, stewed peppers, parmesan), Sticky Stack O' Chops (sweet and spicy pork chops, treasure rice, shishitos), Duck Shepherd's Pie with cheesy mashed potatoes, and All-American burger. My favorites were actually the appetizers. The fried cheese curds are pretty much mozzeralla sticks but with a more airy/light texture. Tap Fries are pretty much poutine, a superb set of fries. The Mac n Cheese was really nice and cheesy. I enjoyed my flatbread, and the truffle was quite prominent. I only wished there was more bite to the crust, as it was more on the soggy side. For drinks, I tried the Poor William, a citrusy gin based cocktail. This was very light and refreshing and just a tad sweet.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty good meal. I really enjoyed the fried cheese curds and tap fries, and I would recommend. The entrees were great, but I think I would skip the flatbread next time.

The Smokey chicken pot pie is unbelievable. The serving size looks small but is deceivingly filling. So much flavor in this dish and the cheesy biscuit is the perfect dipper. The brisket dip and catfish po boy are also good options but I feel the both have too much bread vs protein and would benefit from a slimmer roll.

Today, I ordered a couple breakfast skillet bowls at the drive thru window. After handing me my order, the employee walked right away immediately out of view without even checking if everything was okay. I waited for a few minutes to see if she'd see me and come back. Nothing. So I drove around to the drive thru window again. (The first mistake - how is anyone going to be able to tell you if their order was missing something if you just hand them their stuff and walk off where they can't even get your attention?) When I asked for more hot sauce, the employee told me that I wouldn't be allowed to get more than 2 sauces per food item (and to begin with, I had about 5 hot sauces in the bag for 4 skillet bowls, so not even 2 per item as it was). Her name was Tori. She literally said I would NOT be able to. Then, I inquire more about this new policy. (I had been coming here for years and nothing was ever said.) She brings out her manager Jen, who says that they stopped giving more sauces because employees were giving too much, but that I could get more if I asked. She ended up giving me more, but likely just to save face at this point. (If the policy was that you get 2 per item and can ask for more if you need it, why did the employee outright tell me NO?)\n\n11 months ago: Very, very hit or miss, but what do you expect from a Taco Bell? Some days, the food is excellent and it really appears that the employee has put effort into putting together your meal. Other times, you can just expect to lose money when you leave here because something was very clearly done wrong. First and foremost, their ordering system tends to be a problem as employees constantly get items wrong. At the first window, the person who provides your sauces, utensils, straws, and napkins may forget one or more of these things in the midst of taking your payment, so you may need to ask for whatever items you didn't get at first, at the second window. Lastly, the food could either be sealed properly in the container or not closed all the way and fall all over you as you attempt to remove it from the bag, like what happened with my last power menu bowl, and rice, beans, and sour cream spilled all over the bag and my work desk. Attached are also some pictures of some nasty overlooked black beans I got today in my side of black beans and rice. The beans were very hard and I could barely even move them with my spoon. Upon closer inspection, they've been heated so long that they've turned into hard mush. I just threw them out and considered the $1.50 a loss.

That was the extent of the ""cleaning"" after a table of 12 year old boys wrecked the place. When I asked the chef for more sauce, he grabbed someone else\'s bowl (a stranger, not someone in my party), and then he didn\'t understand when I looked disgusted and asked him to use my own bowl, thank you very much. They kept the to go boxes next to dirty dishes. The service was terrible, too. After being seated, we waited for over 30 minutes for our chef. I got splashed multiple times, and not during the whole ""we are going to fling food at you"" grand finale. No, this was the chef slapping food on my plate and haphazardly lighting things on fire.

I was there one day with 2 friends and only me and one friend ate the other only had a drink. We were there for about an hour total and during that time she visited our table twice, once to give us our list for the all you can eat and to get our drink order and again to give us our drinks and take the list. We were the only ones there other then one guy sitting at the bar day drinking... She was the only person working, but instead of waiting on us, she was to busy flirting with the dude at the bar.. My friend who only had order a soda only got his initial drink never got a refil and neither did my other friend and I. When we were done we waiting 10 minutes or so before I finally got up and walked over to her at the bar and asked for the cheque and she said she would bring it right back over to our table so I went and sat back down, 20 more minutes go by before I\'m finally pissed and go get it myself. Mind you she never once left the bar. I signed my receipt and left without tipping her. We walk out and are half way out to the car and she comes running out yelling ""excuse me! Excuse me!"" And she was pleasant at first asking if there was something wrong with our service and I was so dumbfounded that she actually chased us out of the building over this.. And before I could open my mouth my one friend said ""nothing"" and before anyone could say anything else she became enraged and stomped her foot forward and put her hand out towards us and angrily said ""then why didn\'t I get a tip!?"" There are so many things I should have said to this woman at this point but did not. I called and complained as soon as I got home and the manager who barely speaks English agreed to give me two free all you can eat sushis to make up for it (I never did tho) and a few months later I went back with my whole family and low and behold she remembers me... She did not say anything, but she did make sure to spilt in my glass of water :) as for the other reason, I\'ve been there on three other occasions for the all you can eat and in at least one piece of sushi (usually a rice ball) was a long black hair all throughout the piece of sushi.

I\'m not sure if there\'s new management but there was a noticeable difference in staffing.  The overall experience was: have people wait as a captive audience at the bar and then churn them through the meal portion with half rate hibachi guys.  The hibachi guy botched the utensils toss at the beginning- bad first impression.  The eggshell was visibly present when he also botched the egg toss and proceeded to fold it into the fried egg.  Fried rice was crunchy.  Burnt vs. eggshell... who knows?  Left me wondering ""what the eff did I just pay for?""  Not going back.', ""This restaurant is clearly great for kids: the koi ponds, the chefs' performances, and the fires will entice most young (and old) customers. However, the food is unfortunately not very good. The filet mignon was tough, the lobster was rubbery, and the scallops and rice were flavorless. The salmon had a decent flavor but was a little dry. Even the sashimi was uninspiring. A lot of the decor also relied too much on plastic plants.

I got a chocolate layer cake for the party and a cheesecake for me to bring home! I also picked up an assortment of salami and cheeses. I noticed they have a coffee bar where they make a bunch of gourmet coffees which smelled amazing. The deli has a huge variety of Italian meats and cheeses. They have pre made trays of lasagna and other dishes. They have packaged fresh pasta in every variety can you imagine. This store is old school Italian. I didn't even know that stores like this still existed. I was pleasantly surprised by how reasonable their prices were especially for the high quality products that you get. The store employees were also very helpful and friendly. Judy was the best. She helped me make a gift box for my husband's grandparents and beautifully wrapped it with ribbons. I bought a gift card for my husband's aunt and uncle who live in West Chester and they were thrilled to receive it. They told me how much they love Carlino's and told me all about their favorite foods from there. The chocolate cake was a hit at the party by the way.

We tried pretty much everything we wanted on our wedding menu, and everything was really good! A lot of times, Italian food for large events is just thrown together in my opinion.

We ate the left-overs at home for like 2 or 3 days. \n\nSo yeah, the food was great, but more importantly the staff was amazing. \n\nOur wedding was held at a DIY venue, and the staff there was pretty difficult, constantly reminding us of what ""wasn\'t their job.""

The chicken in any dish containing it must have been frozen cubes that were nuked in the microwave.  Just doesn\'t taste fresh. I\'m willing to wait longer if we could slap a few fresh pieces on a grill.\n\n3. Replacement cards.  We\'ve been waiting about 8 months for a replacement card.  After a few months, we approached the front desk twice and were told this can take some time because it\'s ""coming from corporate"" both times.  Is corporate located in another galaxy?

At such a high price, shouldn\'t satisfying members be their top priority?\n\nI tried to come as a guest of my sister, who is as member at this gym and had a free guest pass. Once I arrived, they told me that free guest passes can only be used Monday-Friday. This came as a shock because NO WHERE did it say that. We even double checked the app and the membership contract and saw nothing that indicated this was a policy. This incident was the beginning of us discovering the gym\'s many hidden policies. For example, members can also receive ""Life Time Bucks"", which are promoted as something you can spend anywhere in the gym. That\'s NOT true. They can\'t be used in the cafe or to purchase guest passes (and there are probably more restrictions that I\'m not aware of/weren\'t mentioned to us at the time we joined). Why market this as something you can use throughout the gym if that\'s not the case?\n\nWhen raising these concerns, I\'ve received the cold shoulder (an experience I believe others have had as well). While I understand these policies are usually beyond the control of employees at the KOP site, I wish they appreciated their members enough to be more explicit about their policies that are currently being hidden. As someone who also works part-time in fitness, I\'m appalled at the way Life Time treats their members-- I could never work at or be a member of a place that shows such little value in their members.', ""This is a first review I left during the last 8 years on Yelp. \n\nOverall this is nice a gym, paying a couple hundred more a month for a family membership I would expect more professional staff tho. I don't need a facility member give me a cold look when I tried to get a simple answer about the swimming pool policy. \n\nBrought my two boys for wkly semi private lesson, they jumped in the pool trying to warm up bf the lesson. They passed the assessment test and were given the green wrist band which allows them to swim by self. The life guard nearby named Blake V., w no emotion, said they need to come out or I need to be in pool w them. I was confused and tried to figure out why, she got impatient and have the don't bother me attitude, and said: more questions you need to go the office to ask, and turned her head away. I tried to ask what time they can be in the pool by self since they have the green wrist band, she kept her head away as if she does not hear you, Simply awkward for me to stand there...\n\nI am not here trying to make a big deal out of a simple situation, if it is a 20 dollar gym I not gonna give a damn about it.

You might even find yourself becoming a Heart Stone regular, just because it's such a wonderful and uplifting place to be! \n\nSo what are you doing? Go visit!"", ""The space is beautiful and modern and the coffee was great. I enjoyed being able to take my coffee outside into the courtyard and soak up some sun.

The barista and other workers were lovely. I don't regularly drink coffee so I ordered a strawberry chamomile kombucha and a GF chocolate/almond cookie. The kombucha is made locally (Baba's brew) and is one of my favorites. I loved that my drink was served in a glass rather than plastic!

I found this cafe today via Yelp while looking for coffee around Phoenixville. Agree with others that it is 'slightly' tricky to find.

The cafe space is HUGE, open and also cozy all at the same time. I was taken back with it while I was there. The barista offered EXCELLENT SERVICE & made the best Chai Latte I ever had (paired with a great bagel from Green Lion Breads) Seriously get out of the drive thru line and go support this local business! You won't regret it!"", ""Coffee is ok for a specialty spot and how much the barista was bragging about their coffee. It was difficult to find the cafe as there are no signs and they aren't listed in the Franklin Commons directory. \n\nBarista who served me seemed antagonistic towards friendly customer service and customers in general unless they wanted to go on an aimless search to discover them. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back every now and again to experience as they evolve their product offering; however, the attitude I got was customers should be happy to experience us and we don't care to make it easy for customers to be served or find us. Probably not the most effective culture for a small business in growth mode.\n\nSelf-service coffee was ok.. maybe a bit more concentrated flavor than Wawa, not burnt, but definitely not the boldest, some aftertaste flavor at the end. If you are a coffee snob, you can find the service and talk here to match, but the ready made coffee is working towards the highest echelons of snobbery. \n\nGood luck growing this business - it has a lot of  potential to serve the north side of PXV! I enjoyed walking the halls to see all of the beautiful artwork. Worth coming here to see that while sipping on some coffee.\n\nEdit: I updated this review with an additional star after the owner's reply. It  took a lot of guts to be so candid, and the context and receptiveness really was appreciated, went a long way, and gave me a sense that this business isn't just 'tude-forward. It made me feel a lot better about the experience as my allergic reaction was towards the service which created a trap for the product.

Ordered the chicken parm since you usually can\'t go wrong with a classic dish. It didn\'t disappoint. I was really good. After dinner they give a shot of limoncello which was really good!!! My only suggestion to them would be if they\'re going to ""advertise"" or welcome people to BYOB of wine/champagne then don\'t charge a corking fee of $8.

The service is also very good. With all the positives, it is no surprise that the restaurant is popular and deservedly so. The problem is that last night there was insufficient parking requiring people to drive around and wait for an opening. Inside the restaurant, the noise level was extreme making it very difficult to hold a conversation within our party. Then there were celebrants of events who insisted on singing at the top of their lungs, friends of the owner no less, who appeared to encourage them. Numerous times we had to stop a conversation and wait for ""quieter"" moments to continue. The restaurant is not set up appropriately for large gatherings, greater than 6 people. There should actually be a second floor to cater to larger groups. There definitely too many people jammed into the space available.

In hindsight,I this was a MAJOR misstep -- a little over a week ago, I scratched my cornea attempting to take out a RIDICULOUSLY DRY contact lens (which was prescriped by Dr. Hajduk). I called the office immediately the following morning. It WAS before they were open, but I left a message, stressing my urgency that this was an optical emergency and that I needed to be seen as soon as possible; the time was approximately 7:30 am. I\'ve done this before (not in YEARS because I\'ve been around the block and am finally compliant with my CL wear) and knew I was going to need something stronger than your basic artificial tears. I was at work and left them the number; I ended up leaving early because I was so uncomfortable without hearing from them. They called me after 2 pm. So more than seven hours later; for an emergency. Here\'s the best part--when they called my job, one of my employees told them I\'d left early and they asked her for my cell phone number BECAUSE THEY DIDN\'T HAVE IT. I\'m an ESTABLISHED PATIENT. Why, praytell, do you NOT have my contact information?! What are you ACTUALLY DOING in that building??!??\n They call me (Ken? Keith? Kurt? Don\'t remember) and I say ""I called before 8 am and left a message saying I needed to be seen as soon as possible. I described my symptoms on the voicemail."" I got ""I know."" ""It\'s seven hours later."" Again ""I know."" ""Seriously."" And AGAIN ""I know."" And I finally had it: ""Yeah, I KNOW something too. I know that if this is how you treat patients with obvious EMERGENCIES, I\'ll never come back. I\'ll be following up to let you know where you can send my records."" Not even an apology, explanation, SOMETHING?!\nEven better? I definitely scratched my cornea, as confirmed by another optometrist; it was nearly a corneal ulcer which can get REALLY NASTY and lead to ophthalmologist/specialist visits if left untreated. Go with your gut; you get what you pay for and sometimes the extra drive time is worth it in the end if you escape the hassle -- and discomfort!\n**Side note--if an optometrist is prescribing new contacts from a brand you\'re not currently wearing, they should, ideally, bring you back in for some type of follow-up to check said lenses on your eyes. Ideally three hours is a good minimum for them then to look at the movement, vision, and variable dryness. At that time they can tweak the prescription or CATCH ANY ISSUES if necessary. Had she done that, she would have been able to see that these new lenses were drying the bejesus out of my eyes.']","[5.0, 1.0]",2,3.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well I called back tonight and there was no credit issued. Shocker! This is the last time I will be ordering from there."", ""Ordered a pizza at 530. Was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. When I got there, they didn't have my order and the guy behind the counter tried multiple ways to make it seem like I'm the one who screwed up. No apology. They just let me walk out, without my pizza. No offer to make one up quickly or anything. I went to Whole Foods and got a pizza in 15 minutes.  We had been regular customers at Spatola's Downingtown since they opened. I'll never go back. If there was a zero star category, I'd give them that rating."", ""We ordered our food on the Slice app but there's not much of a review option. First, the food was prompt, I'll give it that. The driver was friendly as well. Not bad. We only had two problems with our order. The pizza was fine, fries and mozzarella sticks were fine as well. Come to the poppers. They were smashed in the bottom of the bag in a mushy messy pile of what looks like cheez whiz, and not actual cheddar cheese, breadcrumbs and jalapeños. As for the Greek pizza, I nearly broke a tooth on a pit of one of the kalamata olives! I'm not ok with this and have ordered many items in the past with those and other olives and this did not happen. Am I the idiot here and should have checked every single olive on the slice before eating it?! I think it's absurd that a restaurant doesn't do this themselves as part of prep to avoid this from ever happening. After the pain of smashing a pit between my teeth subsided, I checked the remaining 3 olives...2 MORE PITS on the same slice!! How is this even possible? Definitely the last time we're ordering from there."", ""The Trenton pizza is MUST TRY. I'm a huge pizza lover and square cut pizza is my favorite, but hard to come by in this area. I was excited to learn that Spatola's offered square cut pizza. The garlic added to the Trenton pizza compliments the delicious sauce and tasty crust very well. Incredible flavors all around! My only feedback is to work on maintaining the crispness of the bottom of the pizza, so the crust does not get soggy. The top of the pie remained crisp, but the bottom was so moist when I opened the pizza box that I had to crisp my pizza in my oven. If Spatola's can just work on that, they'll be around for years to come!""]","[1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 5.0]",8,2.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was meeting someone for breakfast and they told me I couldn't sit until he arrived - I found that strange.  I can't sit and have coffee while I wait for my friend?  Weird.

They wouldn\'t seat us (3 were there) until our 4th diner showed up. Keep in mind there was no one else waiting and all the tables were for 4.

Was looking forward to the chicken and waffles today, looked on line and realized they closed at 3 (new to the area) Being that I have worked in restaurants for many years, didn\'t want to walk in with minutes to spare keeping all of the employees longer than they had to be there. Gave them a call at 2:30 and asked the employee who picked up if it would be okay to be sat at 2:45, which would be the time we would get there. He answered ""we close at 3"". I asked if they would be kicking us out at 3? He said no. I then expressed that I didn\'t want to put the employees in a bind. He answered; ""we close at 3"". I was trying to better understand if it was busy or not and how they treat customers who run in late. I believe I was told ""we close at 3"" four times by the young man who answered. I told him he was of no help. I understand it was my fault for being late, however the answer was not professional and not at all what I expected given that we are always treated very well by the staff.

On Sunday, we decided to swing by for breakfast because the wait did not look too long. We waited probably for 20 minutes because there were two tables waiting ahead of us--no problem. But as soon as we were seated, we ordered... our food must have taken 25 minutes or longer to get to the table. One of the tables in the room decided they could no longer wait and asked for the food to go! The puncher is that no one, NO ONE, came to the table to advise us of the delay and our server didn't even acknowledge it with an excuse or an apology! That's what I find most frustrating.

It\'s true.', 'Leaving this joint feeling unimpressed and grossed out about the quality of my meal. \n\nFood: Generic diner style breakfast served here with a couple more intricate dishes. Maybe it\'s I showed up here early or maybe because I had pancakes and my dining partner had a standard egg dish  but really nothing great. \n\nThe pancakes were massive and the waitress laughed about how she could have warned us but thought otherwise. The buttermilk pancake was dense and had no  flavor. There were some scattered baking chocolate chips inside and on top of the pancake. This meant that the bites with chocolate were overly sweet considering how much of a sweet tooth I am. The pancake was difficult to cut through likely because the ratio of flour to wet ingredients was off. It was the weirdest manoeuvring of my fork to access the pancakes\' internal fluffiness (which was underwhelming). \n\nThe eggs and toast are eggs and toast. You can\'t seriously mess them up(?) but they seemed fine. \n\nThe coffee was over-brewed which made it very bitter. I ended up not drinking my coffee due to my first coffee having clotted milk all inside it. Major turnoff and I headed to McDonalds for my coffee fix. \n\nService: Early morning service can mean that you have a bit less attentive staff. However, I walked in with jovial staff chatting with two regulars. That seemed like a good start to the morning...Unfortunately, that kind of jovial service was not in the cards for my table. We seemed to be an utter after thought. We waited for a bit after finding out the favorite album of a regular and the chi chat that accompanied. We waited for our waitress to notice us and avoid eye contact when we were served spoiled milk, we had no one around during our meal or refills of coffee, we were not offered water...I can go on but the highlight was the waitress reiterating the hilarity of not informing us of the size of the pancakes and how someone once tried to eat three of them and ""it didn\'t end well"". To get our bill, we had to physically go to the counter and wait for our waitress to decide we were worthy of attention. \n\nThis place gets a two for the simple fact that there was parking and my dining partner thought the eggs were fine.

It's a shame because I will be here at least few times a week to get their awesome loaves of bread and pastries if I lived closer by. This is not your typical restaurant/cafe where you sit and order your food. It's basically a buffet style where you take a wooden cutting board tray and pick what you want to eat from the buffet line on the wooden tray. Each items are marked with the price. I don't want to sound like a cliche, but Buttery emphasizes on locally sourced produces, supporting local farmers, and using organic, pastured and humanely raised meats and dairy. I love their various grain salads with seasonal vegetables, their pastries are so delicious, but I have to say I love their bread. The way they make their levain (starter culture) for their bread must be different from other places. I know that a good slice of bread tastes delicious by itself or with good slab of butter! Buttery bakes their bread perfectly and if I'm not careful I can and will carbo load. \n\nAfter you get your food you have to find a place to sit amongst their communal tables (there are some bar stools facing the window counters). I understand some people love the idea of communal table, but I am not one of them. It's quite awkward for me, but I did experience sitting with some friendly folks before. This time it was next to some family and the older lady sitting next to me just turned her back towards me (I guess she felt uncomfortable also?). This is the only thing I don't  like about Buttery. I only get to come here on weekends and it is always crowded. I should try coming out here during week days to see if it's more breathable with less people. \n\nThey have a separate drink section where you can order your drinks. There are some memo pads and pencils in a small tin bucket on tables where you can write down what you ate. When you are finished eating you take the memo pad to the check out and pay for your food. This is completely an honor system so please make sure you are honest!\n\nYou can also purchase their loaves of bread and pastries if you don't want to stay and eat.

The decor is clean and rustic, with plentiful seating and an open kitchen that constantly replenishes the buffet-style display of food.\n\nAt first, I was confused by the honor system payment scheme - the customer chooses their food, then pays at the end, after having eaten. It's an idea that definitely encourages the friendly community feel of the place, and an idea that could only ever work on the Main Line. \n\nAll the food I tried was great, though the items certainly added up quickly! After much deliberation (everything, especially the pastries, looked great!), I got the pulled pork sandwiches, a chicken pot pie, a canelé, and a flat white. The coffee was excellent and the chicken pot pie, though lukewarm, was flaky and flavorful. I would have liked to see more reasonably priced vegetable side options - the salads were all priced as full meal portions and there were no other plain vegetable sides (e.g. green beans or brussels sprouts) available. \n\nMalvern Buttery is deservedly super popular, attracting families, students, and local workers alike. We arrived right before the lunch rush, so the buffet bar was well-stocked, but when the crowd came, we did notice that all the buffet items got snatched up quickly and quite a line formed to pay and order coffee.

Yes,Mabel's Barbeque,4.0,92.0,1.0,"[""Found this on a road trip. So glad we did! Quiet little place with just a few tables. Warm, friendly service. We ordered the fried pickle chips and hushpuppies to start. Perfectly fried deliciousness. For meals it was the pulled pork sandwich and the fried flounder sandwich with sides of mac n cheese and sweet potatoes. The pork was so juicy and tender. The flounder was lightly fried and tasted like heaven. Sweet potatoes were by far, the best I have ever had! Thanks Mabel's for the great meal!!!"", 'Solid food. Everything we had was quite tasty and we all left happy and full. Wish they had better ventilation in kitchen.', ""I am super excited to have found this place, not only is it the best fried chicken I have ever had anywhere close to this area but the service was also a game changer for me. We called 15 minutes to closing and the food was brought out to us so fresh and hot. We dined in and didn't feel rushed at all. The owner welcomed us and told us she was glad we stopped in. Each and every side we had was seasoned to perfection. Perfect selection anything you would crave is on the menu. This is now my top five favorites."", 'First time here.... My husband and I had to wait 30 minutes for macaroni and cheese- we started to leave but decided to wait.  I had to call Ms. Mabel to let her know this was the BEST soul food EVER!!! Everything ordered was absolutely delicious.  We will be back!!', ""Well, we've now had our first experience at Mabel's, and I have to say, I'm sorry that we hadn't stopped in sooner! It's odd...we're big fans of barbecue and have lived in West Chester four years (which is distinctly lacking in barbecue establishments), but had only learned about Mabel's in the past year, and now finally made it in.\n\nIt's a very small place, so keep this in mind if you're dining in. We lucked out and got a table for four at 7pm on a Saturday night, so that was a good start! Ribs were the most popular order of the night, but we also enjoyed the chicken (barbecued, not fried...that'll be sampled next time) in addition to sides of mac n' cheese, potato salad, collard greens, green beans, and breaded mushrooms.\n\nEverything was great! Both the ribs and the chicken were moist, tender and tasty. I've seen reviews from people who bitch about a lack of barbecue sauce...which for us was brushed perfectly onto the meat, as opposed to served on the side or in bottles on the table, and I had no desire for any extra sauce. For me, barbecue sauce is an optional accoutrement to good barbecue, and the better the barbecue, the less sauce is needed. The brushed-on sauce was a great compliment to the meat, but nothing additional was needed. We had zero leftovers...every rib bone was clean and dry, and all the side dishes were completely emptied. \n\nOne of the best parts of the experience was as we were finishing our meal and the evening's business was starting to wind down, Mabel sat down at the table next to us, and we had a delightful conversation with her. We always enjoy chatting with the owners of independent restaurants, and Mabel was no exception...just an absolutely sweet lady; we really enjoyed meeting her, trading stories and learning a bit about her, her family and the restaurant.\n\nWe're already looking forward to our next meal at Mabel's and highly recommend stopping in for a leisurely meal or some takeout whenever you have the chance!"", 'Was fantastic !

Halfway through our meal we had to track down the server for a coffee refill and felt awkward with people crowded by front door watch us eat.

They gave us complimentary bruschetta and shots of limoncello. Our waiter was really nice and attentive! The food was absolutely amazing and our portions were pretty big. The wine was good too! I can't say enough good things. We will definitely return."", ""Best Italian restaurant in West Chester hands down. All of their food is delicious, is always hot and the portions are awesome. Lots of wine to choose from including beer too. Plus you get complimentary Limoncello shots after your meal. Parking is tricky but it's so worth it. If you leave hungry after eating here, there is something wrong with you!"", 'Great food, but incredibly loud to the point of seriously impacting the experience!!!!  Its not the restaurant\'s fault, but rather the groups of 6-10 that descend on these restaurants and feel that unless they are shouting, somehow they are missing out on the ""experience"".  I\'m not saying it has to be your grandparents ""slow death"" restaurant with stuffed pheasants and fox hunting prints on the wall, but it could not have been louder eating at Lincoln Financial during an Eagles game.  If you are an arrogant 30-something who wants to shout over your IPA or Pinot Grigio for 2 hours, this place is perfect. If not, perhaps visit on a weeknight or later in the fall.', 'We read mixed reviews and wanted to offer our input. Dined here last night. We are early before a concert (5pm) & I would always recommend reservations. People were waiting @ the door when we left @ 6:30pm. My only complaint is that our poor waiter was covering too many tables. Maybe someone called out?  He worked very hard & was everywhere but they were slammed. The food was wonderful. From the complementary bruschetta when we first sat down to the complementary shot of Limoncello to end the meal, we enjoyed everything. I would recommend the grilled  calamari salad. The calamari was cooked perfecting. My husband had the beet & goat cheese salad & thoroughly enjoyed. I judge an Italian restaurant by their lasagna & Limoncello did not disappoint. Plus I have leftovers for lunch!  The sea bass special was terrific as was the veal with shrimp & crab. We took a second beet salad with additional salmon to go for our performing son. Still good when he finally had a chance to eat 3 hours later. We tried a wide range of food and we pleased by all selections. Make a reservation & go.', ""We were visiting the area and saw the menu and reviews for this place and decided to stop. All of our meals were excellent! Everything is all a cart so it's not cheap there, but the quality of food was wonderful. The home-baked bread was awesome! My son had a seafood Alfredo and it had huge pieces of lump crabmeat and jumbo shrimp. My wife had this chicken that was stuffed with asparagus, cheese, and Italian meats, all over pasta. It was unbelievable! Huge portion and very delicious. I had short rib ravioli which were delicious. We got dessert to go, and while the desserts were all delicious, they were quite expensive at nine dollars each. I tasted the complementary lemon cello after dinner and it was probably the best lemon cello I've ever had. I would definitely go back to this place if I was in the area again."", ""I've been to Limoncello twice and loved it both times. Food and cocktails are delicious, and portions are extremely generous. Love the complimentary bruschetta, fresh bread, and limoncello dessert shots. Prices are reasonable and the experience there is great value for the money. Only negative is that it's difficult to get a table without a reservation. As long as you're flexible with alternate seating arrangements (bar tables, outside) you can usually get seated quickly."", 'Wish I went here instead of awful teca, ugh terrible. Anyway ,  Great food, great vibes, so highly rated by everyone.', 'Classic, go-to WC restaurant. One of our favorites. Always amazing, authentic Italian food!', 'We had a great experience with Haley, our server.  She had great timing in her service, even though we took a long time to figure out our order.  Haley helped us pick out selections of the charcuterie board as well as drinks.  We also ordered the fried calamari, the rigatoni alla Guiseppe, as well as the seafood alla vodka (substituted the rosé sauce).  Everything was delicious -- we are always delighted.', ""Our dining experience Tuesday night was wonderful.  Fantastic ambience, especially sitting by the window against the cold city streets.  Bread and wedge salad were delicious, then came the main course.  Chicken Parmesan over linguini with Fra Diavolo sauce.  Wow.  This might be the best chicken parm I've had anywhere, and trust me, I've tried it many places.  Great portion, thick cut with a perfect crispness under that melty cheese.  The Fra Diavolo was sensational on this - amazing bold flavor with just enough spice.. really elevated the entire dish.  Finished up with a flawless Creme Brulee, as close as it comes to a perfect meal."", ""this is the place to go for a good celebration dinner! we made reservations for Friday for our anniversary and were really pleased with our dinner and service. I got the chicken Alfredo and I really loved it minus the extra weird vegetables in it like peas. I would suggest maybe not eating lunch before because you will be super full and stuff because some of this food is heavy. plus you get a limoncello shot at the end of dinner which is fun. if I could afford it I would come here a lot more often. also in terms of parking there's a lot around that are free just make sure to look for it."", 'Food is great, love the owners my only wish the bar area was bigger! So the wait for a table is more comfortable. But it is always worth the wait.', ""We waited a very long time for our food last night. We didn't order appetizers, just dinner. No drinks were refilled.

The service last night was terrible."", ""Another wonderful dinner at Limoncello!! The food was amazing , the staff was friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere is awesome. Can't wait to go back !!!"", 'Great dinner at our favorite restaurant in the borough.

We will be back!', 'This is by far one of the best Italian Restaurants we have had dinner in a long time. I love to cook and eat, and we are so disappointed when we eat out at most places. We were hesitant about going out to dinner. However, we were so happy that we did. While driving home we were already planning what to eat the next time we go!', ""I don't understand why this place was so busy.  My friend and I tried it for the first time a week ago.  We put our name in knowing we would wait 90 minutes.  I didn't care because I was looking forward to enjoying drinks and conversation with my friend.  After waiting 90 plus minutes I politely inquired on our status.  They couldn't find my name - they had forgotten about us.  Two hours later they sat us in a corner by a large window with vents - it was so cold!  Our food finally came.  I ordered a penne vodka dish.  It was the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  No flavor and dry.  I may try this place out again with my husband just to give them a second chance, but again I can't understand why people seem to love this place around here."", ""A definite go to for Italian food. I split the beet and goat cheese salad and it was very good. The goat cheese was warm and delicious. I also got the Chicken Limoncello which came with asparagus and pasta, very tasty! Always good and it doesn't hurt to get the free shot of Limoncello after your meal. Nice atmosphere, best to make reservation."", ""Fabulous Food and Excellent service.

What a joy he was . He's s keeper!"", ""I was in town visiting my boyfriend's family and everyone raved about this restaurant. We went for the lunch buffet and it was great for the price. Multiple styles of salads, pastas, and pizzaa to choose from. Definitely will back next time i'm in town.

Love the Limoncello martini and the complimentary shots at the end. My husband asked where I wanted to go for our V-Day dinner and without hesitation I said Limoncello. Perfect for a night out with your other half or with a group of friends. Also, I never write reviews so this should tell you how good this place is!', ""This place is great. You just can't beat their lunch buffet, I've only been here three times and I've had that every time. For $11.95, you get all you care to eat of some pretty top notch options. I think their pizza and veggies are especially good. They also typically have a fish entree and a beef and/or chicken option available as well. Go hungry to their lunch buffet and you will not be unhappy!"", 'Food is really good and service on point. Not a wasted meal ever and happy hours are fun with lots of appetizers. If in town, this is a place to setup dinner. Suggest calling ahead because the secret is out. If nice weather, outside street seating too.', ""Fabulous from start to finish!! I booked my reservation on Open Table and when we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us quickly. Our server, Marty was wonderful. He was patient with us as we talked to our friends we hadn't seen in years. He checked back with us but never rushed us or seemed annoyed. He was really the perfect server! We couldn't say enough compliments about the food as we were eating it. It was the best meal We have ever had at any restaurant. My husband almost always orders chicken parm so he has a lot to compare. He is still commenting on how delicious his meal was. I had the, delicious pumpkin gnocchi, that melted in my mouth and tasted like dessert. Yes! It was that good!! Looking forward to returning in the next few weeks!"", ""Have you ever been forgotten? Sat for 35 min waiting for a simple plate of pasta - no appetizers, just pasta. It was amateur hour, for sure. The waitress appeared shocked when we left as she seemed blissfully unaware of our dissatisfaction. At least I got 1/2 of a Manhattan for free (they dared not try to charge for it). Go to the sister restaurant in Chester Springs. We've always had a good experience there."", ""Another fine meal that I feel like I stole today at Limoncello in West Chester.

My family decided for the buffet, and I wanted the chicken parmegian. Nothing says a good Italian restaurant like a good chicken parmegian!  And I was really pleased with the dish. \n\nThinly pounded chicken and fried to perfection. Sauce and cheese were flavorful and tasty.  The linguini was slightly under cooked (30 - 60 seconds more) but I'm not a big pasta fan to begin with. Otherwise, this was outstanding. \n\nIf you are in West Chester and looking for an amazing Italian restaurant, make sure to stop in!"", ""meal comes with a piece of brucetta per guest and two different kinds of bread. both delicious. i got the shrimp and crab fra diavlo...let's just say i am so happy the dishes were so big so i can eat it for lunch today. large lumps of crab meat, 8 jumbo shrimp. the pasta was el dente just the way i like it. my bf got lobster raviolis, and i love how it comes with a lobster tail as well. gianna our server was nice and attentive. definitely a place i would eat at time and time again."", 'If you are looking for a fantastic downtown eatery..Limoncello West Chester is a must do.

But a lot of my old favorites have lost some of their magic. The Lobster ravioli that was once the spirit animal of my dreams was dry and chewy the last two times I got it. The Calamari that used to be pillowy clouds of squid, just good now.\n\nI will say that there is another location out near Chester Springs that is still fantabulously delicious. When I crave the calimari, I make the hike out there instead :)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nstill good, but go to the one in Chester Springs\nQuality: solid italian food\nValue: pricey but not tear-inducing"", ""It is absolutely delicious here. I think the quality of the food you receive is worth what some other Yelpers consider to be a higher price. You really can't go wrong with what you order but my big tip is if you're between pizza and a pasta go with the pasta. The pizza's wonderful too but it's quite filling and it's not at every Italian restaurant where you'll find such flavorful, beautiful pasta dishes. \n\nIf you read to the end of my review then you'll get the real tip that they do have a Happy Hour menu but you do have to (and should) ask for it."", 'Love this place!!

We ordered the Crab and Avocado appetizer which is just simply amazing, especially for dining outside in the summer. It's so clean tasting and refreshing. My husband ordered the Carne Pizza and I had the Penne Alla Vodka. The pasta was a small, tapas style portion for happy hour which was perfect for how hungry I was. The pizza is always delicious at Limoncello. The takeout pizzas are the real value. They are larger but for the same price!\n\nDuring our meal, someone, other than our server, came out to check on us and how our meal was going. I've dined at Limoncello many, many, many times and that has never happened before and was much appreciated.\n\nLimoncello is one of, if not, my favorite restaurant in WC. The food never disappoints and their happy hour menu is the best!"", ""As is my usual opinion , the Limoncello experience is full of fun, laughter, and great food.  This evening, I sat at the bar.  Dave deftly handled the demands that the evening presented.  He has a quick wit and makes his patrons, who have become friends, welcome.  Tyler, his bar back, creates an efficiency that enables his bartenders to focus on their primary duties.

I was unsure - this seems to be a place that caters to ""the convention"" crowd, and that\'s NOT what we were looking for.  But searching online, I struggled to find a more extensive bourbon list for a restaurant in Philly. So we took a shot. \nWe went on a Friday evening (8-ish).  Surprisingly, the dining room was nearly empty - so that may have impacted our visit in a good way.  I can see how a dinner crowd with no interest in bourbon could make for a hectic dinner service.  \nWe got the cowboy steak for 2 - perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Potatoes were great as well.  It\'s easy (and all too common) to serve a mediocre steak, but this dish excelled - we would return for it.\nService was attentive and friendly - even shared some other local restaurant tips.  Bourbon list was as advertised, and Daniel enhanced the experience by helping us learn (and taste) different options.  Overall, the staff delivered exactly the experience we were seeking.

I told the server and he said ""oh, I did tell them, but do you want me to check?""  Yes, that would be nice...  it was yogurt so I got a new one but no thanks to the staff. It took a while to get my cocktail and weren\'t sure who our server was. To be clear, organization is not great here which isn\'t the fault of the server, but of management so don\'t blame the messenger!  We also asked for olive oil with the bread and they just brought more bread. Again, communication not their strong suit.

The buffet is definitely cost effective and satisfying (continental...which I don't see often except for in hotels, which this happens to be, haha). Really lacking in a la carte options, the list was miniscule...but the a la carte desserts and delicious, especially the carrot cake doughnut.

Delicious. \n\nThe restaurant is spacious and I saw quite a few groups, large groups, like 8 and more. That's cool since a lot of places can't comfortably accommodate that many. \n\nI think the fact that this place opens early even on the weekend is a plus (it probably does that because it is in the hotel) \n\nThe service is ok...I had one absolutely amazing server, very attentive without being intrusive (I wish I remembered her name to shout her out) but the others were simply ok, not terrible. \n\nThe bathrooms are the hotel bathrooms."", 'The first thing that impressed me, was the warm welcome and handshake by Kevin at the bar.

Our bread plates and platter were never cleared for the entirety of our meal on a cramped two person table. I had to ask a manager to check on our drinks after our first course came but the drinks hadn\'t yet arrived. Our fries came out after we\'d finished our steaks. We were still charged for them. The table next to us had to ask the waitress to check on their food twice. She then brought out their check while they were still eating and they had to tell her they were planning on ordering more drinks and dessert (again, this was at noon during lunch, not 1 AM as they\'re trying to close). Every other table had to stand up and request their check. My boyfriend put our meals on his credit card. When the waitress came back she addressed him by his last name and said ""you as well Mrs HisLastName.""  We are not married, neither of us had a ring on any finger, and we did not say we were celebrating an anniversary or anything along those lines. It was a weird assumption to make. We let it go and laughed later, but plenty of people would find that offensive. It could make for a very awkward situation if we were on a first date or a business lunch. \n\nI will say the manager was very nice and came around apologizing to every table. However, if they were aware service was that bad maybe they shouldn\'t have been letting her serve. There was another waitress with no tables of her own just kind of hanging around and filling water glasses. Still didn\'t bus our crowded table though. I\'m happy we were only paying lunch prices.

We had wedge salad and ricotta as starters, steak for our entrée and apple cobbler and chocolate mocha cake for dessert.   All wonderful.

However, others at my table who ordered the steak felt they did not get a large enough portion and were hungry after finishing. The service was excellent.

While we definitely wanted to check it out at some point, we weren\'t going to go to Bank & Bourbon this particular night because we felt a little underdressed in our nerd-chic t-shirt attire. Our original dinner location was having ""an issue"" with their kitchen, so we strolled back down the block to Bank & Bourbon. And are we ever glad we did!\n\nWe had been snacking on ""convention food"" earlier in the day, so we decided to go straight to our entrees. Filet for my wife, and the blackened trout for me. Now normally, when I see trout on the menu, my first question to the waitstaff is whether or not they have any kind of strawberry jam, preserves, or puree. Almost always, the answer is no...and then they look at me funny when they make the connection that the strawberry jam is meant to go ON the trout (trust me, everyone thinks it\'s weird at first...but then they try it and love it). Not only did B&B have a wonderful small jar of high-quality strawberry preserves, but our waiter seemed to appreciate the genius of strawberry jelly on trout. It especially balanced out the cajun spices of this particular piece of fish.\n\nAfter our entrees we decided to throw caution to the wind and get some after-dinner drinks and dessert--the mocha cake...which was equally parts beautiful and delicious.\n\nWe are absolutely looking forward to our next visit to Bank & Bourbon!', ""I took a lovely young lady here to get out of the thunder storms and it was such a nice time!

I ordered some coffee and some bread and got a cocktail for her. The service was very friendly and smiley. I really appreciated it. At one point a young child sat on the back of our couch, which was rude as heck, but I can't blame the restaurant since we were in the hotel part. Service was quick!

I got the chocolate cheesecake (though it wasn't on the menu, I got the hookup). One of my friends got the chocolate bread pudding and said it had no flavor.

If you know Philly, you know that a dinner reservation on a Saturday for 12 or more people is nearly impossible without a complicated and expensive pre-fixe menu. Well, not at Bank & Bourbon. After contacting 20 restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by the ease and accommodation B&B offered us. They easily booked our reservation and welcomed us without any contracts or pre-fixe menus. When our bachelorette party arrived, we were blown away by the amazing private room we were given - we did not expect that. The decor and ambiance is great in general, but this private space was just so nice. Then we were greeted by our awesome server, Jacob, who was on top of EVERYTHING the entire time. Jacob and team greeted us and the bride with a free champagne toast - what a nice touch. Throughout the meal, he also surprised us with a few of his fav apps and his fav dessert. It was just so above and beyond, we were stunned. And everything was sooooo delicious. The cocktails were YUM - I got Tipping the Velvet - love it. Food I enjoyed: the roasted carrot salad (omg so good), the truffle parpadelle w/ short rib - amazing, and the filet mignon. Split all of this (and the apps and desserts) with my friend. We were delightfully full. The dessert we received was some sort of carrot cake-ish donut with ice cream. OMG - to die for. If you are planning a special event - choose Bank & Bourbon. They will wow you and take care of you. Shout out to Jacob for being awesome. Thanks for a memorable dining experience.', ""Delicious food. Got the salmon plate breakfast. Our server Jasmine was very nice. My daughter who is 4 didn't like the syrup to her pancakes. She asked for chicken nuggets and jasmine went above and beyond to make that happened.

In terms of service, I will say that it was inconsistent at best. Some of the staff were incredibly friendly, others aloof and just dropped the bread and butter on our table like it was on fire. The place was nice overall, but it was definitely one of the loudest dining establishments that I've been to. Even as we sat at the far edge of the restaurant, we had to almost shout across the table. Speaking of which, we had really wanted to sit next to each other, and wrote that specifically on the reservation website, but despite it all, we were placed at a table where we could only sit across each other, and there were multiple other tables that were empty that could have accommodated our request.\n\nThe food, finally, in a nutshell was meh. My favorite was actually the fresh fish of the day, where it was served whole on a bed of grilled and seasoned herbs and vegetable. The soup and salad felt uninspired and really bland. And finally, the dessert was laudable: dry, oily, and tasted like it came from a microwavable box.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was definitely my least favorite restaurant week menu in Philly, and I've been to at least 10 over the past 2 years.

I'm a pretty frugal person and didn't realize how pricey these would be. However, I ended up buying two pairs because I could tell these would last me years. I bought a Sebastian McCall black bootleg pant and a dark pair of bootleg jeans.

We told her multiple times that we're just looking but she literally was right behind us the entire time and wouldn't leave our side. Made us so uncomfortable so we left. Will never go back. Whatever happened to giving customers space when they are BROWSING? Please stop this. Also, I personally don't even think the clothes are that special or fashionable. I'll take my business elsewhere."", 'I miss this storeS shopped here a lot when I lived in Philly. I have more than five jeans from them. I only buy jeans I never tried the other clothes and not interested. But jeans they fit real well and great quality plus the price of made in USA. I also love that they offer to return the old jeans and give you credit towards a new pair. So it is a good way to feel environmentally friendly zero waste and recycling mindset.  About the reviews I read about salespeople being too close. Actually they do that because this brand is known for fitting so they are trying to help explain how things work and in my experience I don\'t find them annoying like some other stores because they actually do help ! I always have them figure out the hem because they get it right every time and hassle free. I moved from Philly and I am going for a quick visit this week and I called them to check if they still do the return jeans for a credit and I am happy I can bring back my first pair from a couple years ago which I cannot fit in anymore and they offered to bring it back and get the credit. So awesome! The jeans quality is great. Unique cut and fit real nice. I had nothing but positive experience with this store. If a salesperson is too pushy why one doesn\'t just politely express how they feel and ask for even more space. I can say "" I am an independent shopper and would appreciate some space so that I focus and decide without any distraction. I don\'t feel comfortable when a sales person is near me"" honestly I think if one says this, they would give space.

We sat outside but the only way back into the restaurant to pay or use the restroom is back through the front door. There is barely enough space for the hostess stand and the entry way. As we were trying to pay for our meal, it was very difficult to even stand and speak to the hostess. Second, the wait staff seemed rushed and curt with us.

The lobster Benedict lacked flavor, perhaps bacon would be a nice addition, and the cinnamon bun French toast was more cinnamon bun than French toast.

Children were freely roaming off the corralled black top area they are forced to spend most of their days into the parking lot, just looking for anything to do, while the counselors sat huddled at the few picnic benches in the shade with their faces buried in the screen. \n\nMy child has shared some of his engagements with the counselors, the real highlight being told to ""not worry about it"" when expressing his concern about a boy telling everyone that he was going to go into the girls\' locker room and pee all over them. He also routinely engages with the counselors to have sunscreen put on, yet he comes home sunburn everyday.\n\nThere seems to be very little structure to the campers days, as campers are clearly aimlessly looking to entertain themselves at drop-off, pick-up, and mid-day. The marquee activity of the day, the ""dance party"" was taking place while I was there, and the song being played was Chumbawamba\'s TubThumping. I\'m not sure anyone could think that a song that includes lyrics regarding getting drunk and pissing the night away is appropriate for children, some so young they are still in preschool. \n\nMy child has not been himself while at this camp, he is very upset at the end of the day and is constantly asking my husband and I to not go back. Other parents have shared similar experiences as well.

Yes,Cafe Baladi,5.0,54.0,1.0,"['Tasty Kaftah burger pita and fries - yummy.  We also ordered the falafel and tabbouleh.  The parsley hummus on the lamb burger was so good!  Will be back!', ""As I looked around yelp for a place to eat for my lunch break, I stumbled upon Cafe Baladi, a new Lebanese place that opened up inside a shopping center across Lancaster Ave in Malvern. I decided to give them a try, and I'm so glad I did.\n\nFirst off, I have a very soft spot for family-owned establishments. The owner greeted me when I first walked in. His wife worked with him and they had two beautiful girls. Very nice family overall.\n\nI was so happy when I found out that they had sfiha. Not many Middle Eastern places serve it, and when they do they are mediocre at best. I also ordered the cheese fatayer which was also stuffed with spinach. And finally for my first meal at Cafe Baladi: a chicken shawarma sandwich with fries!\n\nThe Sfiha: DELICIOUS! It certainly wasn't what I expected in terms of shape since usually Sfiha's are prepared like pizzas (flat dough with meat on top) but this was just as good! I had to hold myself from eating the 2nd piece. My mom would be so upset if she knew I hadn't saved her any.\n\nThe Cheese Fatayer was amazing! I admit I hadn't realized it was also stuffed with spinach until I took a bite. I thought I made a mistake of ordering Spinach Fatayer but the owner assured me that all Cheese Fatayers are also stuffed with spinach, which was literally pure heaven in every bite. Might I add that the spicy mayo served with the fatayer is to die for!\n\nTheir Chicken Shawarma was probably one of the best shawarmas I've had so far. The chicken was flavorful and had the perfect mixture of spices, and the sandwich itself was toasted to perfection under a panini grill. And of course, the traditional shawarma garlic sauce that was served on the side and placed inside the sandwich was the real deal. It's an art that not many places can perfect. The best part is it reminds me of the shawarmas back home in Syria. I wish I had finished the whole thing, but ended up boxing the other half to eat for breakfast the next day.\n\nAnd let's not forget those delicious homemade fries. I didn't even have to ask and confirm from the owner to know that they were homemade. The Paprika seasoning was a good touch. As any Syria would do, I also dipped them in the garlic sauce :) \n\nAnd did you think I was going to leave that place without trying their Hummus? Though I didn't order it, the owner was generous enough to give me a sample along with some toasted pita. It's A+ Hummus on my book.\n\nOverall this was a great lunch, and I will definitely be back. I'm looking forward to trying their other stuff (Kibbeh, Fattoush, Falafel). \n\nI spoke to the owner and his family for a bit and learned that they recently came to the States from the Dominican Republic, where they used to own a similar place. \n\nI wish them all the success! You'll be seeing me very often for lunch!"", 'Amazing authentic middle eastern food. I grew up eating home cooked middle eastern food with my family so I am very picky. This place is fabulous. Fresh ingredients, amazing flavors, clean, wonderful service (Husband and Wife owners are incredibly friendly) and very reasonably priced and great portions! \n\nWill be coming here often and telling everyone about it!', 'Super cute place.  Excellent shawarma pita wrap!  I ordered that and got an apple Laziza. Definitely worth a visit.', ""This place has delicious, fresh Lebanese food. My favorites are the chicken shawarma wrap, yellow platter, hummus with beef and tabouli salad.  It takes time to prepare so if you want take out, I recommend calling ahead to order and if you're eating in, expect to wait a bit but it's worth it. It's a BYOB."", 'I went in almost by accident because the new indian restaurant a few doors down was closed between 3 and 5. The green platter was quite delicious - i am not a big tabouleh fan and the owner happily substitited a hearty bowl of fattoush salad instead. Small gestures like this make it very satisfying to support family owned places with a heart. The falafel balls were cooked to perfection and perfectly spiced, and the rest of the platter was yummy too. \nI ordered the lentil soup - it was very good, but a little lacking in spice for my taste. But overall a pretty incredible meal!', ""Really good tasting food. I got the lamb pita and it's a very nice range of flavors and consistency. I can't speak to how authentic it is, but it's good food and I'm sure many kids would eat here without issue."", ""I'm not a usual Yelp reviewer but felt the need to do so here.  I stumbled upon Cafe Baladi by chance by being in the shopping center but I am so glad that I did!  Let me start by stating that Lebanese food is my FAVORITE cuisine and since moving to the area 2 years ago, not having a local spot has been a huge point of contention.  \n\nWife and I went there with our 1 year old (he loved their hummus).  We had the mixed shawarma, fattoush salad, and tabbouleh, all were amazing.  We enjoyed it so much that I picked up the next week for ourselves + siblings + parents and everyone agreed that the food was excellent.  And its BYOB!  It's also great chatting with the owners when you are there in person.  I highly recommend Cafe Baladi and expect to go back on the regular."", ""It was so good that I had to come back again. This time with my fam.\n\nWe decided to try their soup of the day, which was the lentil soup. I don't think describing it as delicious is enough, so let's just say that it earned my Mama's approval. \n\nIn the ultimate shawarma debate, I am more of a chicken than a lamb shawarma kind of gal, but in an effort to try something different, I decided to give their lamb shawarma a try. And It was probably the best lamb shawarma I've had. The lamb itself was juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly.\n\nCongratulations, Cafe Baladi! You have officially earned my family's approval."", 'Excellent food. All fresh and made in front of you. Great friendly service. Wish it was closer to where I live. I would eat there once a week!\n\nUpdate: 3/5: I went back again today. Same great service, conversation with the owners and fresh food. Just awesome and delicious!', 'We just moved from philly and were not expecting to stumble upon a Lebanese restaurant in the suburban world of chains and pizza joints , especially not one with food this good!

I was given a groupon as a gift so definitely helped with the cost. We made reservations but didnt need them. The place was pretty empty on a Friday night and also it looked like a bunch of the patrons were locals who were regulars. We bought a bottle of wine; however they didnt have it so offered us a similar bottle. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive. We sat next to the window which was nice and bright. The booths in the back looked pretty dark with low lighting but everything looked clean. Their bar is pretty nice. Its huge and well lit.\n\nOn to the food. We started with the tuna tartare. The menu said it came with avocado but instead it came with seaweed salad. Not a huge deal, and the tuna tartare was awesome. The fish was fresh and the poke sauce was flavorful; I would get that again for sure. Next I got the seafood risotto which had decent sized chunks of seafood in it and the risotto was cooked perfectly. Its deceiving how much is in the bowl they give you but I took some home for a second meal. My fiance got the special which was bbq chipotle half chicken. It was huge, but she loved it. The sauce was good, it had a kick to it and worked really well with the chicken. The chicken was tender, moist and the fries were crispy. Overall our food experience was great. While no place is perfect the food here is worth checking out. We will go back.\n\n\nPs. Note to the owner. I almost didnt come to 30 main because I am an avid yelper and saw your response to some of the comments from other yelp reviews. I try to be fair in my reviews because I feel like it helps others make a decision for a food choice when looking in the area. Everyone will have their opinions good or bad on the Internet.

Taste was mediocre, and portions were small.\nMy biggest gripe is that we told them my allergies MULTIPLE TIMES over the phone and when we got there they said ""yes no egg, shrimp or chicken"". Okay perfect, said they would sub for tofu which was a $2 additional charge. Well we got home, at this point an hour and a half after we ordered, and my dish had ALL of those things in it, and two small pieces of tofu - really? \nI called back and told them what happened. I could tell they didn\'t want to remake the dish because at this point it was almost 8:30. Well they did and they threw in a free Thai tea which was nice but again, the dish was mostly just rice, barely any veggies or tofu.

I wish the food was more flavorful. The service was great and the staff members were kind! I'll try something different on the menu next time"", ""thai basil fried rice & drunken noodles are good and have a lot of flavor (they might be too salty for some).\n\ngreen curry was a little heavy on the coconut milk, but it went well together with the other two dishes. i'm not sure if i would get it alone. even though it is supposed to be more spicy (according to the menu), i didn't feel much heat at all."", ""MAMA Thai is easily in my top 5 for take out joints around my house. Love having a new option that's unlike the others in the area. MAMA Thai is a true takeout spot (with a few seats inside) that prices everything accordingly. Portions are a good size and they're affordable. Appetizers, soups, and salads range from $5-10 and entrees range from $10-15 depending on what type of protein you prefer. I love a place that embraces the preferences of the customer and doesn't decide everything for you. MAMA Thai lets you choose between veggies, tofu, chicken, beef, shrimp, or salmon for every entree. Entrees range from curries, to noodles, to rice, to other assorted entrees. There is something there for everyone. My favorites are definitely the drunken noodles and the basil fried rice. My wife really enjoyed the red curry (gaeng dang). Both the tom yum and tom kha are very tasty. To be honest the only thing we didn't love was the pad Thai. It was awhile back, so we'll have to give that one another try, but it didn't have the same strong flavor profile that all their other entrees have given us. \nOverall, I really like MAMA Thai and have been recommending it to other friends in the area. Worth checking out for sure. Oh and try their house made tea. My wife said it's better than a chai tea from Starbucks!"", ""Food is great and very reasonably priced! I met a friend here last night based on Yelp reviews when we were both craving Thai food. It's a small spot with ~5 tables inside - They do a lot of takeout.

Probably some of the best noodles I have in a really long time. Really great service too. Happy we went.', ""First time customer and first I've had Thai.  Very inviting decor for small storefront.

They have so many items on the menu that it was difficult for me to even decide what I wanted. Now I'm talking everything from falafel to fish tacos, to cheesesteaks to French toast. Now while I expect this from a diner, I found it didn't necessarily work for this particular spot. I like to go into a new dining place and know what they are famous for and what they do really really well. I prefer smaller menus bc it's easier to pick from and I have assurance that the food is fresher in the back when they aren't ordering 4 million things each week. The atmosphere wasn't inviting and all of the food needed seasoning. We ordered a pancake and the bottom of it was burnt. The cheesesteak and fries were pretty good and my breakfast burrito was just so/so. I didn't appreciate being charged $1 each for fries and home fries, especially when the home fries were the tiniest portion ever. The server/(possibly owner?) was super sweet and really did take great care of us.

But for a brewery, it's pretty great! All the beers were unexpectedly excellent, and they have great ratings beer tasting apps. We only tried their take in poutine, and the portion was small, but quite delicious! The gravy is actually swedish meatball gravy, which makes sense since they have a swedish meatball app.  It works!  And hey, it's right across the street from a parking lot, which is very helpful in Phoenixville.  Overall, this place was an excellent surprise and is definitely worth a shot!"", ""Visited over the holidays and was super impressed with the beer selection, along with the service. My girlfriend and I shared a flight of four beers, but were able to try a number of others thanks to the chill bartender. \n\nThe brewery itself is very spacious and there's plenty of room to spread out, along with games in the back. \n\nWould definitely come back in the future."", 'The beer is good not great and the food is just ok but the atmosphere and friendly service will make you want to return.

Went as location two on a date and was a fan.

There are TVs in the bar area and had old Kung fu movies playing which was actually unique and funny to watch. Took a little bit to get refills but all in all it was a good time.', ""Great spot for a beer with the family.  Suggest that they post the building's history and the brewery's history on the menu.  FYI, from what I could figure it was an old root beer and orange crush bottling facility.  They did a great job repurposing the space.  The back (beer garden-but couldn't see an outdoor space) was rented out for a kids (?) party, so I didn't see much other than pinball games, air hockey, etc.  The variety of beers was good with something for everyone on our group.

Decor appear to suggest a hip hop, early 1990's MTV focus. There is spray paint (intentionality) on some walls and some interesting other decorative choices. Having said that, when I was there the clientele was mostly middle aged working class people. The bartender was friendly and attentive. He knew their beers, asked about my preferences, and made suggestions. The beer was very good as well. I did not try the food so I cannot comment on that. \n\nOverall, the theme of the brewery would not have been my choice, but it was not overpowering and I was comfortable there. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The beer was very good. I would certainly stop by again if I was in the area.\n\nPs- they appear to have different events. Including drone racing through the bar. The next one is a Monday night but I would love to stop by and witness that type of event."", 'We enjoyed a fabulous afternoon watching sports on the big screen.

Go for the fun, food, and some decent beers.', 'The beer alone separates Root Down from the competition in Phoenixville.  One word of caution their beers are more on the hoppy IPA side which is my particular choice but if you like lighter beers this may not be the best selection.

Plus they have golden tee and air hockey!', ""Okay, Root Down really doesn't need another great review. But I'm going to anyway.

Now while I expect this from a diner, I found it didn't necessarily work for this particular spot. I like to go into a new dining place and know what they are famous for and what they do really really well. I prefer smaller menus bc it's easier to pick from and I have assurance that the food is fresher in the back when they aren't ordering 4 million things each week. The atmosphere wasn't inviting and all of the food needed seasoning. We ordered a pancake and the bottom of it was burnt. The cheesesteak and fries were pretty good and my breakfast burrito was just so/so. I didn't appreciate being charged $1 each for fries and home fries, especially when the home fries were the tiniest portion ever.

We told someone who was clearing tables and showed him he could have the chef feel they are still frozen. We then received our dinners, then we received burnt replacement spring rolls. (Picture to follow) obviously they get irritated if you return frozen food. No manager came by. I ordered the Kennett Mushroom with chicken and it was supposed to have some chef\'s special sauce. It was a bland, flavorless dish so I doused it in soy sauce. I asked the waitress if I was supposed to see some sauce and she was not clear on a response. My husband\'s salmon pad Thai smelled terrible and he could not finish it. He ate the salmon but the awful odor of the dish was repulsive. Finally, some young short blonde waitress came to our table (not our waitress) and asked us if we got our bill yet and we responded ""no"" and she dropped a bill in front of my husband.

Though I did not try the soup, I did sample everything else and it was all delicious. The rangoon and the dumplings come 4 to an order, while the lettuce wraps portion is large enough for a light meal. The starters were accompanied by a standalone set of three sauces to add if  you cared to.\n\nFor my entrée I selected the Drunken Noodles with Scallops. I was given the option of mild, medium, or spicy and opted for spicy. Depending on your tastes this level is either delicious, or too hot to eat. I found it perfect, though added some additional heat from the selection of sauces. Pad Thai was another popular entrée at our table, and everyone agreed that they\'d order it again.\n\nOverall, I\'m really looking forward to trying their curry and other menu options.

At our table was one person with a nut/legume allergy that\'s terrifying. She is always very clear about it, asks lots of questions, explains the need for extraordinary care needed - all the while being extremely good-natured about it. Our server was confused from the beginning, thinking she was asking for additional nuts! \n\nOne of the people at our table wasn\'t sure the point was getting across, so she walked over to the person who\'d seated us to ask for an assist. \n\nEnter Katie.\n\nThis young woman - a senior in high school! - fully grasped the situation and not only ensured our server entered all the special information into the order console correctly, she also took it upon herself to go have a chat with the chef, just so everyone who would come into contact with the food was 100% clear! The chef had the wherewithal to ask whether or not our guest\'s allergy was airborne as well so that precautions could be taken if that was the case (which it was not, but great proactive inquiry Chef!). I don\'t recall seeing out server again after the order was taken as Katie oversaw our meal from that point, but did an amazing job on her own.\n\nAs a note: the A/C was out on July 30 and it was really warm inside (and 96 outside).

There were no cashews( I didn't realize there were no cashews until I had left the restaurant). The meal was not hot. I told my server the meal was not hot. He apologized. I did not send it back because I have watched too many programs on television that show what happens when you send food back. I just got a take out and heated it when I got home.

I got the eggplant with tofu- it was great with a fresh basil taste and just enough heat. She got the yellow curry with tofu and also really enjoyed it. The portions were not huge but plenty for lunch- I was satisfied. The price was very reasonable which is partly because it was lunch.

Definitely some of the best Thai I've had in Chester County ...I would have given them a 5 star but twice our takeout was missing stuff and when I've eaten there it was slow to get our food ...but it tasted so good it was worth it and I have hopes the service will improve :-)"", ""We recently purchased a home in the Chadds Ford area and it's just a few minutes away from this place. We tried it for dinner last night, and it seems they still have some kinks to work out. First and foremost, they desperately need noise abatement. It was SO loud that it was impossible to converse. As we sat not saying a word, we perused the menu. I ordered an orange juice which came out brown, and had a funky smell and taste. I sent it back and ordered a Thai iced tea instead. The glass it was served in didn't hold much, and it was jam packed with ice, so the actual liquid was maybe about five ounces. Next came the shrimp tomyum soup, which cost $5.95. It contained two shrimp. Yes, two shrimp for about $6. The flavor was just ok, with minimal heat. There was one small mushroom in the soup and a couple of scallions. I had ordered the spicy chicken pad thai while my dining companions had the Kennett mushrooms with chicken, and shrimp pad thai. We were pleased that the waiter offered to accomodate a seafood allergy by preparing the Kennett mushrooms with chicken without any fish or oyster sauce, which it originally would contain. That dish was the best of the three. My spicy chicken pad thai was just ok. The chicken was dry and chewy, and tasted as though it had been previously frozen. The entire dish was one-note in terms of taste, with no layers of flavor at all. It was extremely lacking in basil, garlic, onions, lime and bean sprouts, with just a pinch of each throughout the whole dish. The rice noodles, as another reviewer on here noted, were quite undercooked and too chewy. I like just-done noodles, but these were just plain not cooked enough. The dish was overly greasy and extremely spicy. I had asked for medium, but it came out hotter than what I would call medium. I suppose that judgement is quite subjective, but I would caution that they definitely don't shy away from heat in the main entrees. It would have been nice, though, if the heat was accompanied by some complexity of flavor. The shrimp pad thai was also passable according to one of my dining companions, but she also noted it was sorely lacking in many of the ingredients that make pad thai flavorful. At the end of the meal I asked for decaf coffee. They didn't have any. Nor did they have any decaf tea. Overall, I would try it again since maybe it was an off night, but if the quality problems continue I would probably make the second try my last."", 'Food was very good! We had fresh rolls and Tom yum for appetizers. Green curry with shrimp and drunken noodles with roasted duck. Try the Thai iced tea, it is amazing!! Very good variety in the menu with lots too choose from. The best is being able to choose level of spiciness, from no spice to hot. We will definitely be going back!', 'I thought the food here was really good. I had the Penang curry, dumplings and cucumber salad. All were tasty and of decent size. The only thing I was really annoyed with is that one person in my party said to put a lot of eggplant & broccoli in her vegetarian dish (red curry with veggies) and they charged us $4 saying ($2 for each) ""extra broccoli "" and ""extra eggplant"". We both had vegetarian dishes. I could see maybe one $2 charge for extra veggies, but not for each. Maybe it was because it was our waiters first night working.', ""Divine Thai food, right in Kennett Square. I have wanted to stop in and finally did. Everything was  really top notch. The food was really good, firecracker shrimp, tom ka gai and spicy Pad Thai. My food was reasonably spicy. Not too, very nice. I heard the next table comment that a 2 was a notch too much.

Perhaps a bit of sound deadening would be helpful?', ""For an appetizer, we shared one order of the steamed pork dumplings which came with a delicious sauce. Then we each had different noodle soups for dinner. One was the basic beef pho & the other was the duck noodle soup. I would recommend the duck since it was very tasty.

We started with calimari which came with a mustard sauce and a spicy plum sauce both exclent ..\nThe French onion soup was also great now it\'s not really my thing but it was so good my date made me try it. Surprisingly o loved that too. And would even consider ordering it for my self from this place.\nAlso the muscles. In a very light kind of garlic wine sauce like I have never had before .\nAs you know seafood is difficult at times every thing came out tender.\n\nI had ordered bangers and mash.. my dad the steak and my date had the vegetation burger..\nAll came out tasting great \n\nFinally the desert a fresh made turtle cheesecake. \nWe got home and are kicking ourselves for not getting more for the road..\n\nThe server was quick and attentive..\nEven had to tell the manager what a great job they we\'re doing..\n\nWe will definitely be back..\nAlso they have an extensive beer list to choose from.', 'Great beers on tap, love trying local brews. If you like IPAs, try the Conshohocken Type A. Calamari, cajun mac & cheese, and the Big Ale burger are delish. Fun history. Definitely a gem.', ""We've eaten here frequently for family dinners since moving nearby this past summer. The waitstaff is always very friendly and knowledgeable, they are patient with my toddler and we like the food.  The ambiance is nice.  Parking is a bit of a challenge but they have free valet."", 'ate here on Sat night - food is good here but the service was terrible.  15 minutes to get acknowledged and then at the end it took just as long to get a check. Waiter forgot he has already given us the bill.  Kinda weird and a darn shame because the place could be great.', ""The prior pictures posted in reviews for this place did it ZERO justice because the food here is pretty A-1! We're tater tot fans so when we saw short Rib tots on the menu we were in, however, I was hesitant because there wasn't CHEESE involved....when is cheese NOT needed with potatoes????? Answer: TODAY ON THESE TOTS! OMG! They knew what they were doing with this flavor profile. There was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy and sour and refreshing with these bad boys, WOW! And just when you thought the tots couldn't be outdone, the Chicken Pot Pie  said HOLD MY BEER! This was perhaps the most BEAUTIFUL pot pie I've ever seen! That damn crust was flakier than that one friend you totally hate but somehow someway for some unknown reason keep around. WHEW! Perfectly pulled white meat chicken, chunky fresh veggies and that comforting stew-like chickeny gravy goodness! We would order this again for breakfast lunch and dinner! Overall  a surprisingly GOOD experience here in the middle of small town PA!"", 'We had an excellent Thanksgiving dinner at Black Powder.  They had a well stocked buffet with all the classic foods and a few nice extras like salmon and shrimp.  Dessert was an assortment of pies.  Service was great our table was waiting when we arrived.  A great American restaurant for a great American holiday.  It felt like home with out the cooking and cleaning.', ""Awesome first experience at the Black Powder Tavern! We went with a large group and everything from the Fish and Chips to the Turkey burger was excellent. Service was very attentive and fast. We can't wait to go back!"", 'Delicious food - mussels, poutine, NY strip, Cajun Mac and cheese and prime rib grilled cheese. Friendly wait staff and parking was a bit of a bear. We would be happy to go here again. Definitely suggest making a reservation.', 'Food was very good. Service was alright a little on the slow side. Although the food came out  very fast and was very hot. Male host was very friendly and very nice. On the other hand the female hostess was rude and not very friendly. Would probably go back again', ""All around fantastic meal yesterday. We went for lunch- 2 adults and a baby. Sean was our waiter and we had an amazing experience from start to finish. Sean was incredibly attentive and so personable. He acted as though it truly was his pleasure to be there. The food was great. We had short rib tater tots, Brussel sprouts, a turkey club, and a short rib grilled cheese. We'll definitely be back!!"", 'Really enjoyed the bacon wrapped Gorgonzola dates and the chips and dip! But the best part was that the busboy at lunch today worked really really hard and even ran after a customer to give them their leftovers they forgot', 'Food was fantastic except for the bone in my chicken pot pie! It was in my first bite and it made the meal like a game of russian-chickenbone-roulette. Service was pretty slow as well.', ""We dined here with a big group in mid-July. The staff was SO patient with us. We ordered a broad variety of food. Two 11 year olds split the full rack of ribs and a bunch of sides. They loved it.

Each dish was delicious and very reasonably priced. A large number of draft beers and very inviting dining rooms. The waiter, Ryan, was the friendliest most helpful staff member I've ever encountered in any restaurant. Honestly. We all decided we'd return and ask to be at one of his tables again. Best of all, it wasn't noisy or crowded: a perfect evening in Valley Forge!"", 'We had an amazing event here last night! We are so glad we chose the Black Powder Tavern! We had a group from all over the United States and we used the private room upstairs for 36. The event planner made it easy and was well organized. After speaking only once, by phone, we were expected, welcomed and the room was set up perfectly. Menus were printed with our special title at the top. Such a nice touch! The two BEST parts were the food & our server! Ryan Cue made this a perfect celebration.... professional, incredibly great attitude & provided over the top service. Thanks also to the chef!', 'This was my second visit.  The first time was pretty good with some of the dishes making me want to come back and try it again.  Had fish and chips both times which was crispy and light, but the chips were a bit mushy.  What we did enjoy was the fig appetizer.  Very tasty.  The lower rating is being given because not all the food was great and the service was slow.  If I returned it would be to sit at the bar and get the figs.', 'Excellent food and service. Very nice environment. Specials usually awesome. I highly recommend the Black Powder Tavern.', ""Starwise, I will rate this place mainly for the ambiance, and its facility providing a private room where we had a writer's meeting. I say that because personal dining preference can't really apply when you're there for a group function. (The New American [trendy] food, and the whole pub/tavern atmosphere is not my scene for a culinary experience.) So I will do my best to comment honestly on the whole encounter, but be fair to rate for the function it served, which was the objective of my visit.\n\nMenu, VERY typical American pub food. If you like the gamut of Applebee's, Bennigans, etc., you will be much pleased here, and I highly recommend this place. It is actually a nice alternative to the mega-chains if that's otherwise your go-to.\n\nAmong options of burgers, Reubens, etc., I chose the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. It was decent. The taste was satisfying for junk food cravings, and the meat was nice and tender, good quality, and no sinew or gristle to ruin it. I was impressed there. But honestly, I wanted something without a lot of carbs/fat/sugar, and it was frustrating that there are no real healthy options on the menu, but again, that is the nature of this kind of place (no, Caesar salads are not healthy). The sandwich came with fries and a pickle, pretty typical. I was pleased to see that these entrees were rather cheap, between $12 and $16 or so.\n\nI also had a Whiskey Sour, and it too was decent. It seemed totally weak at first, but a few sips in, I could definitely respect the bartender's pour. The booze menu didn't mention cocktails, just listed liquor brands, so I have no idea what whiskey was in it, but I'll assume it was some well stuff, not mentioned on the menu. Then again, I didn't feel all dehydrated and crappy the next morning, so maybe it wasn't well? I'll have to ask next time.\n\nAs for the ambiance, very typical of a pubby place. Low lights, bar, booths, trendy wood grains, black/mushroom colors, etc. It was clean and attractive inside. They have a local theme going on, kind of honoring the uses for the historical buildings of the area, with a brigade of dead presidents' faux portraits on the walls, and framed photos of Valley Forge Park attractions. I can definitely see this place being interesting for out-of-towners, or foreigners. From those perspectives, it does provide a little feel for the area.\n\nMy meeting was in a private room upstairs. We had a lot of attendees this time, so the room was packed. It got uncomfortable with close to 40 people in that room, but I don't fault the restaurant for that because they can recommend party size, but they don't police how many you push in there. My drink helped.\n\nThe room, again, was clean and attractively decorated. If you needed the bathrooms, you did have to go downstairs for that.\n\nOur server did a pretty good job. He was completely alone doing dinner and drinks for the whole room. That is tough. BUT, I know he made a LOT that night in just over 2 hours of his time, so a party like this is the time to bring it (I know from experience when I waited in college). While he was totally on the ball for most of the night, he neglected to bring me a take-home box after FIVE requests. He was so busy making sure to collect his tips, he could not be bothered to just bring me a carton and toss it to me. Grrrr. He deserves another chance, but that was pretty annoying. My food sat for like 30mins in front of me, which is just unpleasant.\n\nThey have tight parking, and thus offer free valet services out front. I don't really like this situ because I drive a Hoopty and it's not like I am passing off the keys to a Ferrari that needs special TLC from some car-parking professional. I bypassed the valet and made a beeline for the one empty spot in the corner of the lot. The attendant kind of gave me a look when I walked in, but I returned him a smile. Nope, no tip for you tonight. Sorry, Darling. \n\nSo all in all it was a decent evening. This New American tavern will provide a reliably filling meal, the flavors Americans in general crave, and the latest food and drink trends in some crowd-pleaser version, always in an affordable price bracket, so you can go home feeling like you're a part of the times. The place is attractive and clean, and can accommodate large groups, definitely bigger ones than ours if they allow you to rent the dining spaces downstairs."", ""Great finger foods and great atmosphere, picture a colonial themed type of bar with pictures of the presidents on the wall, that brownish tone with wood finishes on chairs and tables. \n\nVery packed during happy hour because it's located on a great location in the king of Prussia area. Good drink selections. \n\nBut hey what's the best of all?\n\nComplimentary valet, so you only gotta tip, SIGN ME UP!"", ""Not very good food and not very good service!  Just being super honest !

This place has been jammed packed the last few times that I have tried to eat here. I got in today. I enjoyed the Reuben, Irish nachos and a beer. Excellent excellent. The service was a little slow, but it was late lunch and they didn't have much staff on. It's not a huge deal. I will be coming back to try a few more dishes that caught my eye. \nEnjoy"", ""The last time I was in this building was over 10 years ago for a New Years Eve dinner, back when the restaurant was Winberies (I don't remember too much about the food or inside). However the newly renovated Black Powder Tavern is incredible. You walk through the two double doors and are immediately taken back in time to the 1700s. The inside feels like a modern colonial take with portraits of Revolutionary figures hanging on the walls. There are multiple floors to the tavern, however my family and I sat on the first floor. The layout is cool with booths lining the walls and wooden tables in the middle, with a large bar and the perfect amount of TVs.\n\nI would suggest valet parking your car or parking near the old car wash as the parking lot is not huge and can be narrow at times with parked cars. Valet attendants were very alert and were on top of their game, as they quickly pulled out car around when we were ready to go. \n\nMy mom and I ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad while my dad and my brother ordered the special angus burger of the day. Of course, it wouldn't be a family dinner without calamari apps, which were delicious. The sriracha aioli was the perfect dipping sauce for the calamari rings. The food was great along with the service! The menu is 2 pages but definitely has a great selection as well as a large beer selection too. Would highly recommend eating here! Great food and a great piece of history for our town."", ""I've been here a few times and have had decent food. Went here recently with some friends and got the cheeseburger. While it was good, I think it could have used some sauce or something as it was a little dry. We got calamari to split which I found very crispy and a good size. My main complaint about this place is the price. It definitely is a little on the expensive side for the quality of what you're getting. Service was good and the atmosphere is nice, but I wouldn't rush back because the food is just okay and the prices aren't great."", 'This was a great stop and a lively atmosphere.  They had some innovative dishes and pulled them off nicely.  Great historic building as well.', 'The food was very disappointing, they used frozen Bubba burgers instead of freshly made burgers and there salad was out of a bag with almost no dressing.

What has happened here? This used to be a GREAT breakfast spot and I have recommended them to many people over the years. The food I am sorry to say has taken a turn for the worse. I stopped in this morning around 9:30 and the place was not very busy, maybe 4 tables and 3-4 diners at the counter. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a Kaiser roll, simple right? The bacon which is usually perfectly cooked and crispy was flaccid and undercooked, and honestly, whatever type of roll they tried to pass off as a kaiser was both stale and disgusting. Honestly I know what a Kaiser roll is, in this area we all do. This was not, it was dense, heavy and stale, slathered with butter (this is okay) and flat like a pita bread covered with flour??? What?? The stale fake Kaiser and the bacon killed the nicely fried egg and cheese that accompanied it. If you guys got a new chef train him, if it's the same one, drug test him. I hope this is helpful and I hate to leave a bad review on a place I have been going to for almost 30 years. Your slipping.. catch yourself as word of mouth in a town this size will put you under.
