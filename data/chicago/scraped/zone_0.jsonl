The bun was slightly too big, but it wasn't a detriment either. The battered fries have an outstanding texture and flavor as well, also low-key awesome.More food? Heck yeah!

Hours are from 12-6p and I must have gotten there around 530p.

The server looked like she was confused by my order, which I then pointed it out to her in their menu, then she went to the kitchen \"to see if it was available\" and came back out and said it was and it would be brought out.  I said, \"Stay in line?\"\"Yes\", she said. After about 5 minutes,  I reached the register and told the cashier i wanted to pay for my order and she said \"No, we are out of that\" I said, I was told they'd bring my order out, so could you please go check?  As a first time customer  I wish I'd had a better 1st impression of their place of business.  When I finally got my order home though....it was mmm, mmm good!

I recently ordered a large salad with Prince dressing and something has changed. It's watery, flavorless, almost bland to what it used to be.

Soon afterwards, I was hugging the toilet vomiting everything up. Totally disappointed. I have to add, their bar is completely overpriced. By the time you add a \"heavy\" veggie like cauliflower, you're paying $8 for less than a pint of food. Slow service, \"non dairy\" (and not vegan) creamers available to those getting coffee?

I never knew this place existed until hubby and I went to the Taste of Chicago on July 10, 2022. Their food truck was there. The line was so long! We stood in line but the line didn't seem to move much so we left and enjoyed other parts of the Taste. We really wanted the shrimp because we both love shrimp so we went back to the truck. The line was still long but not as long as prior. We stood there wondering if we'll actually get to taste their shrimp. Then the business did something which was a great idea - they had employees come past the line with shrimp portions offering it to people who had CASH ONLY. That really saved us - we had cash and got our shrimp, left the line and enjoyed. Boy was it good! Very well seasoned and nice sized shrimp. We wanted that experience again so we decided on 8/27/22 to visit their storefront and order the large shrimp dinner and chose fries as our side. It's really nice inside and plenty of room for indoor seating but there is only take out, no table/chairs to eat in. The portions are a nice size and I feel it's definitely worth the price!Young people working there and they were very friendly which is always a plus in my book. We will continue to patronize this establishment now that we know it exists.

One train car was use for storage & supplies; the other for preparing, frying and selling his shrimp. Mind you that's all that's sold...shrimp (delicious shrimp)! Oh, you can get fries and/or spaghetti. But the only seafood you gonna get are shrimp.  On Friday nights  my Bestie & I would come to the City to hang out. However, we had the consume food before drinks. She always wanted to go the JJ Fish. I could not understand why the parking lot was full of car but the JJ restaurant was empty. All I could see were two train cars in the back with a parking lot up front.One day I decided to walk back there to see what was going on. As I approached the stairs to this train car a gentleman was coming out with his bag of food. I asked him, 'what was this place' he replied 'a shrimp house'! I said on a train; are they any good? He then responded 'once you try the shrimp   here you aren't going to want to go any place else. That man did not lie. These are the best shrimp this side of the Mississippi River.Oh let me not forget the spaghetti. I don't eat spaghetti much especially outside of my family.

I picked the spaghetti for both and I order two large cole slaws which are only 4oz a piece. (Your meal comes with 2oz of cole slaw which I didn't know) My total was $27 and some change. I continued to take pictures of the restaurant then I asked the older gentleman was he the owner, Mr. Haire's. He replied yes!!! So I introduced myself and shook his hand. I told him people have been raving about his shrimp and that has gotten great reviews on Yelp! He smiled and I told him I heard that he got his recipe from his mom. He said he did but he tweaked it . He told me that he hoped I enjoy it. By that time my food was ready! I took it to the car and gave my mom her order and took mine. We busted it open right there in the lot! You get a lot of shrimp for a small order!! The shrimp were cooked to perfection!!!! Nice golden brown breading,(no filter on my pictures) nicely seasoned and were a nice size. The breading to shrimp ratio was perfect. They weren't fishyyyyy tasting like some shrimp restaurants are. You know some shrimp places shrimp taste like they came out of Garfield Park's lagoon...this wasn't the case here! The spaghetti was a nice hood spaghetti. Hood spaghetti doesn't have ltalian sausage it has ground beef. It was very tasty. I am not a fan of cole slaw but it complimented everything so well.

The shrimps are juicy, sweet, and served piping hot fresh, my advice is to eat it right away. The batter is light and seasoned just the right amount with a tiny bit of heat to get your blood flowing, if it's not enough, don't worry they give you a container of Louisiana style hot sauce to add a extra bite for you spicy lovers and some cocktail sauce for you traditionalist.

For those that dont know what Fooda is, it's a company located in an office building that features different restaurants everyday during lunch.  Today was highly unorganized and the presentation was shot! Got here around 12:15. The container of fried shrimp looked sad as hell on that counter as there were barely any left and they were microwaving the small cups of spaghetti. Anyone ever heard of those lights that keep food warm? I also didnt like that the microwave was located about 6 inches from the floor.  There was about 5 feet of unused counter space, yet the employees seemed to have everything in boxes on the floor and pulling food out of that.  Utilize your space people!I had second thoughts on leaving but i was already waiting in line for 10 min and didnt feel like waiting somewhere else, so I ordered the shrimp combo that came with 6 pieces of shrimp, a very small container of coleslaw and spaghetti. $11 was way too much for all that and so little food.Pros:The flavor of the shrimp and batter was actually quite tasty, along with the spaghetti.  I can imagine how the shrimp would taste if it was hot and fresh and crispy.  But instead it was room temperature and a bit soggy and stale.  I guess that wasnt really a pro,  but hey I tried.The only time i would give these guys another shot is if i passed by the actual restaurant on the street.  Im sure, at least I'm hoping, that the food is much fresher there.If i see them again at Fooda - i think ill pass and use my $11 elsewhere.***thought i took a pic but i guess it got deleted!", "date": "Jul 20, 2018", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60620", "rating": 4.5}

The ribs had a wonderfully deep, rich smoke flavor and were perfectly tender. They normally baste the meats in their sauce when serving; however, since we we taking it home, we opted for the sauce to come on the side. The sauce is vinegar-based and goes great with the ribs. Love it!The chicken wings were equally good; crispy and tender. The shrimp was solid. The hot link was a bit too coarse for my taste, but I'm sure others enjoy it.

I've been going to Lem's for over 65 years, because their first location was at 59th and State Street, on the southside. Then, I believe in 1968 they opened another spot on 75th right near Calumet Av, also on the southside of Chicago.  The exact address is 311 E. 75th St. I was at Lem's the Sunday before Labor Day this year with a friend and we stood in line for 2 1/2 hours. I wasn't mad, either. It was hot as Hades, but we endured. The owner brought Water out to us twice and the bottles were nice and cold. Today I went back and I got a slab of their amazing ribs with extra bread and a 1/2 pint of Cole slaw. I had them dip the slab twice. For me, I have to have the bread soaked in the sauce and because I don't eat spicy food I always get it mild, but the seasoning is a little on the spicy side if you can't tolerate any spice, whatsoever. Therefore, I take a bite of rib and follow it with a little bit of coleslaw to cool it down. It is so good! I don't know what they're doing, but I will never, ever buy ribs anyplace else. It's not just the sauce or the meat, it's everything. It's no-frills, absolutely delicious, barbecue.  And, the slab came with bread, but I always get extra.  Do yourself a favor the next time you want barbecue ribs and check out Lem's. You'll thank me later. So good!  The hot links are good, too. PS. And, they accept credit cards.

Let me give you the heads up, you cannot place your order in advance for pick up.We waited in line for 1 complete hour before we were able to place our order. We ordered the JBL special which comes with 2 ribs, 1 hot link, 2 wings, rib tips, and fries. I asked for spicy bbq sauce on the side. The cashier explained to me that I would need to mix 2 containers together to yield the results of the spicy bbq sauce.There's no place to sit inside to eat. We were so hungry we decided to eat in the car. The ribs and rib tips were pretty tasty. Their original sauce is a watered-down after thought and it's not sweet like normal bbq sauce. It's not very tasty at all. In order to get the spicy bbq sauce that I requested, they recommended that I mix their bbq sauce with picante hot sauce. The end result was so disgusting I am convinced they are not tasting their sauce before serving it to customers. The BBQ sauce should be the easy part. They have mastered the hard part- they can produce ribs and rib tips that are tender and very delicious. They created an epic failure with that BBQ sauce. I understand they've been in business for over 60 years---that bbq sauce couldn't have tasted that bad.

At the risk of sounding elitist, many people just don't understand quality food. Any true pitmaster or barbecue judge will tell you ribs should never fall off the bone. In fact, if they are you'll be penalized in any reputable competition. It's like the folks complaining about \"undercooked\" or \"pink\" chicken . It's called a smoke ring, smh. The same people order their steaks well done, prefer Moscato, think Au Cheval is a mediocre burger, and only eat shrimp tempura maki.Sweet Baby Ray's has ruined a generation of BBQ consumers because folks expect sweet tomato based sauces. There are different types of sauce and Lem's version perfectly compliments the smokey tips. I will admit slabs are not what they do best. I mean Lem's single-handedly created the rib tip culture found on the South and West sides of Chicago. Stick to tips, fried chicken, hot links and maybe the cole slaw. Service isn't particularly friendly, but always efficient.Lem's isn't for everyone, but you'll quickly lose credibility with critiques that expose a lack of food knowledge.

I'm from Louisiana and spent ALOT of time in TN and TX. To say I've been disappointed by places up north would be a understatement...but Lem's was a delicious surprise! So parking is kinda iffy if you go during the busy hours (which is like all the time) so I had to park on the street. They only allow 3 people inside at a time, which is pretty ok since the inside is pretty cramped. Like you order when you get in and ideally they have your order ready by the time you get to the cashier (5 minutes). The lady who was cashiering seemed to be sweet. Reminded me of home a little bit. I got the JBL special to go because it seemed to be a good mix of everything. It comes with rib tips, links, and fried chicken on top fries with mild sauce over everything. Not sure why Chicago doesn't that but whatever lolThe rib tips were meaty and delicious. Had a nice Smokey taste about them. The sauce was a good accompaniment that had a little spice about it. 9/10The links were meh. I guess I'm use to spicy smoked sausage, but these were like...dry. Like left out on the grill too long cause you're drunk Saturday night dry. Not a fan. Chalk it up to a busy night and perhaps they were lit ‍The fried chicken was delicious. Nicely seasoned, and had the mild sauce on it so it was a pretty messy affair too. The fries were Chicago fries...soaked in mild sauce at the bottom of all of your meat. LolAll in all I'd be super down to to again. Like I said, after dozens of restaurants tried (like in what world are Italian restaurants suppose to serve rib tips lmao) I'd say this is a top choice.

I will note I asked for a peach cobbler but the waiter never followed up. The chicken was Barely lukewarm warm, which was interesting because the yams and mac were hot. This is a massive issue because the baked chicken was the main course and cost the most. Also, I got smothered baked chicken, and there was no gravy, and the portion of chicken was a bit small for the price. However, it was still good. The yams were a delight. My mom had pretty much the same issues with chicken. Her sides were mashed potatoes and greens, the meal's highlight. Whoever made the greens needs to be complemented. My sister got the Salmon salad, which she enjoyed. It was a substantial portion. Overall, the experience was very mediocre.

Like most, I'm more familiar and comfortable with this establishment's sweet tea/ lemonade. Very delicious by the way. So why not give them a go for food?! Shall we... Upon entering, on a Saturday afternoon during rush time, we were sat immediately and given glasses of water and menus. From the first look at the menu, my friend and I just knew we were about to drop bank lol We ordered the fried green tomatoes, two pot roast muffins and the Hennessy wings appetizers (8 ct). For the entree, I did the fried catfish meal with gravy rice and candied yams. My friend chose the baked chicken with yams, Mac and cheese and greens. Your entree only comes with two sides; she ordered a separate side. She only chose to order the Obama lemonade. Let's get into this review now. Fried green tomatoes - love love love the crispiness, the flavor and the pinch of heat that comes with it. Wasn't a fan of the guacamole sauce to match but it's a cute touch. I do wish it wasn't as salty but what southern spice isn't? The Hennessy wings - boiiiiii this are tender! Sweet but not too much. You taste ever so lightly a smiiiidge of the liquor but you'd have to be looking for it to spot it. Pot roast muffin - wasn't a fan. The meat was lukewarm. The mash potatoes were hard and the muffin tasted sweeter than jiffy mix. Almost as if I were eating a Molly's cupcake. The gravy was the best part but I wish it were more because my muffin wasn't moist enough. Catfish meal - crispy and tender. Perf combo. Seasoning was great and different from the fried green tomatoes so that was a plus. The rice and gravy was good but again needed more gravy and the rice was under cooked. The candied yams were decent. Too many large chunks of potatoes though. My cornbread was ehhh. Felt grainy like it wasn't cooked all the way. My friend said the baked chicken was tender, juicy and flavorable. She would definitely get it again. The mac and cheese was a bit and the greens were alright. All in all, we both paid about $50 including tax and tip. That's not bad... at all. Considering other places are charging A la carte for Everything, this is a 100/100.

Decided that I would go on a Saturday as soon as they open for business. Good choice.Ordered jerk salmon with mixes greens, macaroni and cheese, and candied yams. Everything came with jalapeño cornbread. The salmon was cooked well enough that it was juicy without being borderline raw. Greens were nicely seasoned without being underwhelming or \"poor attempt\" gourmet. The macaroni and cheese was not bad, unless you prefer runny mac and cheese. It wasn't dry, just cheesy without being oozy. The candied yams were truth serum. I washed it all down with a glass of cucumber mint lemonade that was refreshing.Service was great. I liked that I got what I ordered without complaint and I was left to my own devices to eat without any further interruptions unless I needed something.

Tried to make reservations but not able to, wallk-ins only...this started the downward spiral of tomfoolery...get to the restaurant and there's a hand written sign taped to the inside front door \"Cash Only\". WHAT?? Why wasnt this message posted on the website!!! Who carries that much cash on them to eat at these prices??? Not me!! They didnt have an atm on site so you have to take your life in your hands, go across the street to the gas station atm (a bunch of bs). We really really contemplated leaving but since we were there and I had never tried it we braved the wait and stayed. My friend tried to order several main dishes but they were sold out, so she had to settle for her 3rd or 4th choice. Again, we were ready to walk out but ... it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken in the first place, ordered our food and 20 minutes into waiting for the food, the server notifies us 3 of our side dishes are no longer available!!!! Who ever is ordering supplies and food needs to be fired immediately because they are doing a pisse poor job. We pick different sides and WAIT some more. Our appetizer came out the same time as our entree, so now its not an appetizer anymore!!The server gave us plastic utensils...WHAT??? I dont use plastic forks when I'm sitting down eating dishes costing $30...who does that?.We had to ask for real silverware to eat our meals with (so uncouth)...Why do patrons NEED to asked for rolled silverware that should be automatically be given for a sit down experience!!!! SMHMy friends sides came out cold (greens and mac & cheese) so they needed to be rewarmed. She said the lamb chops were tasty. The service was utter garbage. My fried catfish was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The yams were undercooked, so I had to swap it for green beans (which were great). The greens were terrific as well. Seasoned to perfection and tender. Fried green tomatoes were seasoned and have a spicy kick to them, unexpected, but welcomed. Portion size is more than enough. Definitely had leftovers for tomorrow. The food, if you can get what you want, is terrific but going through the BS makes me not want to come back. You have to mentally prepare to deal with waitimes; have several dishes in mind (in case they're out) and not have your mind set on one thing because you will be mad when its not available; bring cash just in case; DONTcome on a SUNDAY!!!! Too many issues to want to come back and thats unfortunate because the food is terrific. The questionable business practices, poor service, and lack of food availability overshadowed the good food (as long as its hot).", "date": "Sep 30, 2023", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60619", "rating": 3.5}

{"resturant_name": "Oooh Wee It Is", "alias": "oooh-wee-it-is-chicago", "text": "Let me start with the good. I've eaten at this restaurant three times. Twice in their smallest location, I believe off of 79th and one time on 83rd, for carry out peach cobbler only. The peach cobbler was EXCELLENT! The owner was very accommodating although the credit card machine was out. My last visit, on Christmas Eve 2023 makes me reconsider if I want to go back. Before I get into that, the oxtails and the fried fish I bought for my mom, was really good, she said. So here's my total experience. 1. They didn't greet me when I came in. I stood at the desk for a while and despite eye contact being made several times with one of the four people standing at the front, nothing was said to me. One person was on their personal cell phone, or so it seemed. 2. After placing a large order (4 entrees with 5 desserts, at around $160), it went chaotic. While in the store, I see my yams were missing. They corrected that with no problem. Halfway to Indiana, I realized my two peach cobblers were missing. I drove back and they replaced it. Again, without a problem. After giving it to me, I tried to talk to them and ask them a question. They were so busy talking amongst themselves, no one heard me! I was ignored. No apology. No good-will-compensation, like another dessert for free, or 10% off my next order...nothing but ignored. 3. This is the real issue. I woke up on Christmas, and after watching The Grinch, I proceed to heat up my other two meals that allowed me NOT to cook for Christmas. Usually soul food is better on day two. This was not. If any reasonably priced restaurants were open, I would've thrown my Ooh Wee out. I hate that this is the meal that I had planned for my daughter and me. The dressing didn't taste like it had an ounce of sage in it, but it did taste like high blood pressure. The only seasoning I tasted was salt. My mac and cheese was as dry as the Sahara. I went back and put a little milk over it when warming up, and it was tasteless. It was tasteless before, but it was REALLY tasteless now. The jerk chicken was ok. No sauce for the chicken nor gravy for the dressing though. I have had their left over mac and cheese before and it was as if your auntie made it...it was so good! 4. The last issue is they messed up my order yet AGAIN! I asked for one order of green beans and two orders of greens. They didn't mess up in charging me for the food, why three mess-ups when getting me the RIGHT food? The caramel cake tastes like box cake with homemade icing. It wasn't bad at all, but I had better. The peach cobbler was perfection. Nothing bad to say there. I haven't eaten the greens, salmon or chocolate cake yet. The green beans were \"muh.\" My personal recommendation is to go to their 79th & Western location. I ate there, brought an extra entree, my daughter ate it the next day and was still ranting about how good it was. Or if you do go here, dine in or carry out and eat it within an hour. They don't have enough seasoning and homecooked flair to withhold being eaten the next day.

We got there and placed our orders, time to pay and the cashier asked us to show her the Groupon on two seperate phones. I showed her the two Groupons on my phone but she insisted to see it on two phones, I took a screenshot and sent to my partner and she said no that he has to have the app and log in with my Groupon details that's the only way. At that point we were forming a line, I then told her to give me a moment, she asked us to step aside while she attends to other customers. Understandable. But when we were done, she won't take us again until she was done with five other customers thereby making us wait another 15-20mins.For context, I was sick, I was tired and hungry. I never knew of this \"show Groupon on two separate phone\" policy it was no where on the app. When I showed her the Groupon on my phone she marked it \"done\" on my phone, the audacity! I don't know who told them to touch my phone, she could've told me to do that myself! Not invade my privacy. Also, my understanding of asking a customer to wait and sort their issues was that when they were ready, you attend to them not ask them to wait until you are done with five other people when they clearly were there first.

We waited about 12 minutes to be seated, which was understandable given our large group and the need to set up tables. Once seated, our waitress, an older woman who was soft-spoken, took our drink orders. While she was kind and helpful, she seemed overwhelmed by our group size, as we had to repeat our orders multiple times. I ordered a build-your-own skillet with veggies and egg whites, along with a side of catfish, which I was willing to pay extra for. However, the catfish was not brought with meal, and instead, there was ground beef or turkey in my skillet, which was disappointing as a pescatarian/vegetarian. I did have to wait about about 10 more minutes for them to bring the fish out and sent my other skillet back telling them that I no longer wanted it anymore since it included the meat in it, which I specifically  asked for not to be in it. The issue was promptly resolved, and the catfish was removed from our bill. Unfortunately, I never received the biscuits that were supposed to come with my meal. Overall, while Daleys is a great place to dine, I don't recommend it for large parties unless they have multiple waitstaff available. My first visit was better than this one. I suggest keeping your meal simple to avoid complications, especially if you have dietary restrictions. Despite the issues, the decor is lovely, with portraits of famous African-Americans adorning the walls, and the ambience is inviting.

We entered the restaurant and placed our name on a list. We were told the wait would be about 5 min, which it was. We were seated in a booth and everything pretty much went downhill from there. We all ordered coffee and about 25 min later the waitress dropped off one cup of coffee. We asked where the coffee for the rest of us was, and the waitress replied, oh you ordered coffee too?Are you kidding me?! Strike one! You heard us order coffee and said ok! About 10 more min later the coffee for the rest of the group arrived. We didn't have enough cream so had to ask for more. That also took a long time to come.  Also they don't have any flavored creamers just plain. Our food came out after waiting for quite some time and let me say it was subpar. It wasn't worth paying for. The bacon was drenched in salt. The grits were rubbery and the eggs were not cooked properly. The pancakes were edible but even that I only ate a few bites. We needed more butter for the table, and the waitress finally brought us like 20 small butter packets. Why on earth she thought we needed that many is beyond me!Terrible way to start my first meal of the new year !After a while we asked for a refill on coffee. Should have known better, but the refill took 20 min to come. How does it take that long to refill a cup of coffee?   Did they have to go get the coffee from another establishment?Finally as we were getting ready to leave, a different food runner comes to our table with another tables order. We said oh that's not ours, as it was pretty clear we had just finished our meals and had the check. She goes oh are you sure? Yes, honey I am sure that's not my order! I mean really...

No less than 30 people waiting.We were seated within 15/20 minutes in Ms. Barbara's section. We placed our orders after 15 minutes of waiting. Because brunch included my friend that I have not seen since before Covid, we fell into a long conversation and forgot how we were waiting. After more than hour of waiting for our food:One Daley's SkilletOne Turkey Based ScramblerOne Porkchop DinnerThe waitress continually told us that she was checking on the food and letting us know there was no food. At this point my cousin goes to the front and ask what is the issue with our food. The server at the register notified the manager of the concern, at the same time the waitress also notified the manager of the issue as well. The manager comes over to the table and asks AGAIN as if we have not made it clear that we haven't received our food. She goes to the back and suddenly ALL of our food comes out-- my food was not hot--lukewarm at best. The assistant manager came over gave us her word that she would take care of our table-- after calling my cousin by her first name-- so we finished our food. While sitting there the manager June comes to our table excited to notify us that she took care of us-- she took a whopping $10 off the bill. Ten. Dollars. Thats it. Nothing additional. When my friend and cousin went to the register the assistant manager attempts to adjust the bill for a real discount. June LOCKED THE BILL. SHE LOCKED THE BILL TO PREVENT THE OTHER MANAGER FROM GIVING ANY ADDITIONAL DISCOUNTS. At this point June is watching and acting like she did something amazing. I waited until today because I wanted to be sure that I am not reviewing emotionally. The service is not consistent enough for this type of treatment of customers.

However Despite my busy schedule,And the  high price of gas I returned to 63rd St. to return the food there was no apology there was even laughter and they did not even acknowledge the inconvenience I was caused  This will be the last time that I come here my mom called while I was at the counter and I told her the next time I guess I'll be getting your food from original house of pancakes to which the very ignorant waitresses busted out in laughter. Never again and I'm also letting everyone I'm referred this restaurant to know about the poor level of customer service that is show to Patron. If I could have returned the food on Saturday they could have kept my $45 because I would have gotten my meal replaced. Thank God I didn't. Who knows where that food would have originated from like the salmon croquets, eggs and grits and biscuits I returned.

Call me bougie but I like places that will serve you your own hot water tea pot.  3rd red flagI was craving and omelet and pancakes but menu stated if you substitute 2 pancakes for toast or biscuits it would be $3. Everything I would've chose came with toast or biscuit, so no pancakes for me. Yeah I'm cheap like that when it comes to unnecessary up charges.  4th red flag. Ya'll know i was done at the 3rd red flag right? Now the food. I settled for a Sausage, Egg and Cheese on Wheat toast breakfast sandwich.

Yeah! straight out the freezer and into the microwave. Gross! She said the biscuits were dry and honestly they looked dry. 5th red flagAgain Ya'll know i was done at the 3rd red flag right?

The staff was pleasant and helpful in explaining both food and drink options and giving me a run down and their favorites. Ultimately, I chose the Lupe Tabasco (a breakfast panini where you could add your own ingredients) I added spinach, cheese, eggs and of course the Tabasco sauce for a kick. Additionally i got cheese grits with butter and an iced coffee. The 'Lupe' named after Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco (awesome play on words) was AMAZING the egg was freshly cracked, made, and seasoned, the spinach was fresh and delicately place and the Tabasco really added a great kick to the sandwich. I was told by the cashier that people often add more veggies and meat such as ham or sausage. The grits were well made with the perfect cheese, butter grit ratio and had perfect texture. I enjoyed my iced coffee and the price was so reasonable for the size (12 oz for 1.89) I highly recommend Kusanya not only for the amazing food but the community vibes, pics, plants, staff and events are all worth while as well.", "date": "Jan 15, 2020", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60621", "rating": 4.7}

My favorite part was the celery slaw! Very good!!! And the third was the truffle BLT! Wowza! It had bacon, lettuce, arugula, avocado, and truffle aioli! It was delicious and they put a nice spin on a classic with the Avocado and truffle aioli. I can still taste all the sandwiches and it's going to be hard to pick one when we go back!

The sandwich was delicious, however I do have one thing I wasn't fond of. They left the rind on the slices of Brie that they put on the sandwich. I know, I know, you can eat the rind, but honestly I feel like just because you CAN eat it, doesn't mean most people do. Anyways, would be nice to have that removed, but I removed it myself and ate the sandwich. The honey dijonnaise was awesome and a great addition to the sandwich. I got the \"One Potato Two Potato\" kettle cooked BBQ chips and they were amazing.

Fast-forward to the moment I finally bit into their truffle BLT. Wowza. First and foremost, they did not skimp on the bacon. I'm a bacon crusader, so there's no such thing as too much bacon. Bacon kept falling out of the sandwich every time I bit into it, and it wasn't too crispy, in fact, it's a bit chewy just how I like it. Second, the truffle flavor and distinctive aroma were there but it didn't overpower the sandwich. 'Truffle' gets thrown around so easily these days -- truffle-flavored this and that but it's rare to actually taste it.

A warning as to what kind of shape your body will resemble if you hit this truck every week, since they are on Clark on either Tuesdays or Wednesdays (check their schedule) and Wacker & Adams most Thursdays. They are a treat, for sure. While it will be a slightly spendy lunch option, the food is freshly made, with quality ingredients, and generous portions. My modus operandi is the grilled cheese and the spicy sesame fries. First, I will try to pawn off, I mean, share some of the fries with my co-workers because the portion is huge and realistically should be split between 3-4 people, but I have no shame and have polished off an order by myself before, because these are some damn good fries.  Next, I will happily dig into the beautifully messy, gooey composition of grilled sourdough, caramelized onions, sauteed spinach, and muenster cheese.  I am a fan of using muenster cheese in my grilled cheese sandwiches and was happy to discover these guys are too.  Usually, with the fries involved, I only manage to finish half of the sandwich.  When that happens, I save the other half for breakfast the next day (it re-heats well in the oven or toaster oven; do not microwave, DUH) and I add a fried egg. Heaven!

After the experience I had to today, no more. My husband and I ordered breakfast and coffee Saturday morning at 9:00am. The barista at the register was stand-offish from the get-go but whatever. We are all going through different things and sometimes it's hard to be nice to every person you see. I messed up the tip and asked to purchase an additional item so I could tip her. This perked her up and she was friendly, recommending a donut. She gives my husband an iced coffee despite her specifically asking when he ordered if he wanted iced or hot (probably because I ordered my latte iced). He nicely let her know he wanted hot and she wordlessly snatched it off the counter. Okay. Fifteen minutes later, I still hadn't gotten my drink but noticed several customers that were behind us in line had gotten theirs so I checked with the barista. Apparently my drink order had gotten lost somewhere so she made it right away. No big deal. Another fifteen minutes go by and still no food. We are starting to wonder what's going on when the barista who took out order notices us still without food and comes over to ask if the number on our table is the one she gave us. Yes? Where else would we have gotten it from? She then berates us, yes BERATES us, for not asking about our food sooner. Having worked in the service industry, we just figured they were busy and didn't want to be \"those\" people harassing them about our slow order. My husband, tired of her attitude and waiting, tells her, \"Look, can we just get a refund? We've got sh*t to do.\" She responds, \"We've all got sh*t to do. You should've said something if your food didn't come out in ten minutes.\" Yeah, the sh*t you have to do is taking care of your customers and making sure they get their orders. That's YOUR  job, not the customers responsibility. At 9:36am she angrily processes the refund for our food. I understand things happen, and I wouldn't be writing this review if it weren't for this barista's strikingly rude behavior. I'm still mad though that we went out of our way to buy an extra item so we could give her a $6 tip on food we never even got.", "date": "Feb 29, 2020Previous review", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60637", "rating": 3.8}

They typically have one person working cash register (and serving simple black coffee) and one person making all of the other drinks, so if you snoozed, you're losing, because you might be 10th in line even at 7:30am! .... totally worth it though for that honey nut latte and donut :)", "date": "Sep 28, 2017", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60637", "rating": 3.8}

In my mind if you keep selling out I brought a dozen of wings and they give me one packet of sauce which is what they give me when I order the snack size four.  I asked for one more and they said .70.  For me if you order a large and they are not willing to give you more condiments then when you ordered four this is a place not worthy of my business.I work in the community, not sure about all the dangerous in the hood lingo....and I have heard community members talk about the customer service but I love patronizing minorities.

Everything was made with love except the Mac and cheese it tasted like frozen stouffers had to season with salt pepper and dipped it in the yams juice bomb when I did that. Had a small side of sauce omg so spicy such unique flavor. I would for sure recommend this place.

I'm quite sure the southern way of life had an immense effect on my dining experience at Salaam Restaurant shortly after it opened in 1995 on the south side Chatham neighborhood.  (Salaam Restaurant was a $5 million debt-free project constructed by the Nation of Islam in a very depressed neighborhood.)Opening such a bold restaurant complex in the core of a national recession in a very downtrodden black neighborhood took a lot of balls, to say the least but let's talk about the food!I stopped eating pork in 1991, then all red meats around 1993 so I looked forward to the vegetarian fine dining offerings at Salaam.  Keep in mind, this was a period in Chicago dining history where vegetarian menu options were little more than a sloppy Iceberg lettuce salad with a few chips of tasteless hot house tomato thrown on top.  I still have nightmares about how many times I've had that offered back in the early 90s! Other than travelling up to Devon for some Indo-Paki food, you were pretty much out of luck. Thank God things have changed dramatically!So Salaam was forward looking in a number of ways and this was also noticed in the presentation. Our food was served on their very beautiful wine red and white presidential looking plate ware with gold script.  I'm quite sure this was one of my first fine dining experiences and a friend and I were almost in tears because sitting in their luxurious dining room felt like something out of a dream that we didn't want to wake from.OK the food!  I think my friend ordered a chicken entree but I wanted to see how well the chef would do with vegetarian fine dining. I was new to bean pie back then and was impressed that anyone could make a pie out of white navy beans and make it taste so phenomenal. Our dishes were brought to the table with such grace and care it almost made us want to get up and help them.  I'm sure that will be an odd read for a lot of you but, we were sitting on clouds. :)After many disappointing substitutions for vegetarian food around the city, I'd finally found gold.  The blend of perfectly-cooked greens and sauces were definitely a new experience on my palate. And to finish, we couldn't leave without devouring their famous bean pie.It's been quite some time since I've been and writing this will lead to making a reservation soon!UPDATE: I was just informed that the restaurant will open for dinner during Saviour's Day in late February, 2011.http://www.noi.org/sd2011/index.shtml", "date": "Dec 24, 2010", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60620", "rating": 3.9}

So today we arrived at 12:30 only to be told they are running late and wouldn't open for another 45 mins. The irony is there were several cars waiting in the lot.

I took off another star because the older dark skinned black lady with the African-American mullet, was very unwelcoming. I spoke when I came in, and the staff acted like they didn't want to speak. Specifically, the lady with the hair ear length at the top and long in the back. She barely wanted to speak. Ugh!

Enough with the bad let's look at the good.The place is huge and clean!! The washroom's were clean which should be standard but unfortunately it isn't but it was the standard here!!!! The dark skinned bigger lady was very helpful and gave good customer service!!! She let me know if I waited like five more mins I could get $5 off because it would be a special at that time. Score!!!! So I ordered the white fried chicken meal with string beans and macaroni and cheese. I also got a side of macaroni and cheese.   The macaroni and cheese was good heavily peppered good nice cheese, not just American. The macaroni and cheese was a cheddar and American blend. The string beans and potatoes were seasoned well! The fried chicken was also seasoned well! The skin wasn't crispy because it's not cooked to order. It was still tasty! Myself and my children did enjoy it.

This location in the south side is unfortunately a lot further from me, so I won't be coming here often, but won't hesitate to visit when I'm in the area. The service as great. The girl that took my order had a smile and was friendly. We ordered 3 jerk chicken tacos. These things are just how I remembered them. They put like a pound of chicken per taco and cover them with cheese, cilantro, onions and hot Jerk sauce. The chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection. The chicken is juicy and taste just how jerk chicken should taste like. The taco shell is still very thin and not strong enough to hold this entire taco. Luckily I had flour tortillas at home, to make me an extra taco with everything that falls off. My only regret is being too cheap to buy more sauce. It definitely needed more. Overall still very satisfied with the food they make here. Definitely have to come back more often.", "date": "Jan 7, 2023", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60619", "rating": 2.1}

Work experience So my first week working at Jerk Taco Man I thought this was an ok job despite the hiring process but after like 2 weeks I began to see certain employees I worked with took multiple breaks left food out uncover some other employees had to take over there task until the came back some minutes late also this is extremely terrible for the look of the restaurant because all employees can see into the kitchen and see the disorganization, the lack of staff and the carelessness, and what I've seen from certain ppl working in cash register was so terrible they were rude to customers and all they ask were simply questions, mainly on their phones, and eating and drinking at the register. Besides that when it came to first shift the shift I worked most of the employees came either on time or late to work a few never really came which has other employees working extra hard when they shouldn't but when it was time to clock second shift was always late I left 30 minutes to an hour or 2 after my shift waiting on someone to release me from my task over all working there was terrible.Payday/ ChecksWhen it came to my first pay day it was cool I got paid on time but checks were in cash like any other job I've ever had I've gotten either a check or direct deposit never cash so this was another red flag as  well but when it came to my second check pay day was switched from Friday's to Tuesdays then when pay day came nobody said anything about checks so I text to ask and was told checks will be ready when I say they are all rude like checks weren't ready for 2 days the day I worked another incident with checks were when again I asked about checks and they asked if I could read that checks were late (but as I said before I knew someone who worked there personally so when she said. She received her check I was already pissed asf because why haven't I gotten mine then the person I know said they were only paying ppl they were scared to loose first then other last) shady asl last check before I quit (worked a could of days after) but anyways last boss was super late that checks weren't ready until 8:00 at night who pays employees that late, Employees/ What goes on With employees some do work until they're told to clock for break but others leaves and takes multiple breaks talk to everyone they know who comes in and just barely worked and clocks out whenever this upset me so much because of have to rush and cover for them even though my roll there was Taco roller/Expo I hated running behind the other taco rollers to cover for then as well as rush to expo food out, kitchen was so disorganized, difunctional, unprofessional asf and over all terrible also we never really had materials that were needed we always ran out of some thing and mainly improvised on most stuff like napkins for hard a** brown paper towels never prepared at all.

Upon entering there was a flashy vehicle parked right in front of the restaurant and a long line of people waiting. Inside there was a giant menu full of 78 different variations of jerk chicken and a TV that was on loop that played the same image and song over and over again. Now I expected a long line since this place is highly talked about however I soon realized that I would be waiting for half a century. There was a man taking orders and 3 other guys making the food. It was clearly understaffed as the cashier had to stop taking orders and go help make the food. We ordered jerk tacos and a burrito. 3 centuries later are food was ready however upon looking at the order to see if it was correct we noticed that it was wrong. We would have went back in and showed that the cashier took the order incorrectly but that would have taken an addition 2 centuries and I would have been dead by the time it was ready.  The food was good in flavor and size however it was very sloppy and basically fell apart. Would I wait for this food? No. But now I can finally say I've had the notorious  jerk taco.", "date": "Aug 22, 2018", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60619", "rating": 2.1}

And I couldn't understand why. After I paid for my meal (two original chicken tacos), I looked through a large bullet proof glass. It stretches across the whole south side of the establishment. Just so happens that the kitchen is located there. Then I found my answer to the wait.Well, thank you for being so transparent. I really appreciate it. Obviously, they are not ashamed of the disorganization, lack of urgency, unprofessionalism, and lack of care that is located here.I viewed through the glass individuals leaving their stations for long periods of time, food sitting out for long periods of time and people standing around doing nothing. One example that I would like to share is the egg rolls. Somebody ordered them. But their were five orders ahead of the person with the egg rolls. So the egg rolls were fried then, sat, and sat, and sat, and sat. I witnessed this because, keep in mind, I'm still waiting on my food. Finally, the person received their egg rolls. Cold ones. Like cold beer from the freezer. From sitting out. They didn't want them, and I couldn't blame them! Which leaves my food. My meal. They finally prepared it after waiting another half an hour after I paid for it. I watched my chicken get chopped up, came out poppin' hot, and sat on a wooden board. And sat, and sat, and sat, and sat. She prepared the tacos with now cold meat and a man, with no urgency took 7 mins to give them to me. I went in the parking lot of the place and tasted the chicken before I left on a old salad buffet table (Why is that in the parking lot?). The meat was cold, like the egg roll, like cold beer. I mentioned this to the man that gave them to me. He asked \"What do you want me to do about it?\" Wow. I said I want hot tacos. He replied \"Do you me to put them in the warmer?\" I said no. I want hot tacos. That is how it is served, right??? Hot???They remade the tacos and gave them to me. The old tacos was placed in the warmer (I wonder why)I can't pick up the taco and eat it because the flour tortilla is stuck to the paper it was wrapped in! I chew on pieces of cartilage in the first chicken taco. I was so turned off I never got to the second one. I gave the second one to a friend that stated it doesn't taste ANYTHING like the West side location.Thanks, Jerk Taco Man.(FYI: The clientele of the South side location leave reviews on the West side location's Yelp page.

She snaps at me \"where's your receipt. You didn't have another order\" I tell her \"I had one chicken meal and one loaded fries\" and she begins arguing with the other employees and then snaps at an Uber eats driver that was there for at least an hour from what she was saying.

Currently it runs Tuesday through Saturday - generally they offer lunch during the week and offer dinner on the weekend.  The best way to find when and where they are serving food is by looking at the schedule (http://stemartaen.com/food-truck/schedule/) and to follow them on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/SteMartaen) - they send updates via Facebook during their route.  You can also text message them and request they come to you - their motto is \"Have Truck, Will Travel (312) 857-4393\".Now for the food - the vegan food truck is a collaborative effort between Soul Vegetarian (a local vegan restaurant) and Ste. Martaen (a local vegan cheese company).  Soul Veg is like vegan junk food (not entirely healthy), but its good food for the soul!  That combined with Ste. Martaen's tasty nut cheeses makes for some tasty vegan meals!  With that being said, I was instantly interested in trying the Chicago Cheese Steak.  I give the sandwich a 3.5-4, it was really tasty and I really enjoyed most of the ingredients (seitan and cheese) although I wasn't entirely fond of the bread.  This seems to be a popular item, as I've seen others talk about it on their Facebook and in other reviews.  I will likely try something else next time, though I would get the cheese steak again.

One thing though, I wasn't fond of the tortilla used.The Bernstein Shebazzle - None of my coworkers got this so I'll probably get this next time! Buffalo Chik'n Pita - If you were uneasy about the texture of the Chik'n tacos, try this!!! It's got a more \"meat\"-like texture and the sauce they put in with the pita is just absolutely delicious.

It depends on what flavor you like, but I personally prefer the buffalo.Soul Vegetarian Sides - The Mac & Cheese was DELICIOUS!!! The BBQ Delights were good but this was also a dish I don't think most people would like by itself. I think what would have made this dish really good is if it were served with semi-sticky rice.

Then I noticed on the back of the rickshaw there was a bumper sticker that said \"Go Vegan\".  Yes!  I'd found the food truck....err, rickshaw.  How many people can say they've eaten from a rickshaw? This was awesome.The dude was totally helpful, friendly and efficient.  He wanted to explain to me what everything was but since it was all vegan, I didn't care.  Plus it's fun to play \"culinary grab bag\" and take whatever rolled up sandwich he gives me.  I don't know what it was called, but it was fantastic.  I also had a slice of pecan pie.  It was a beat up slice that looked like it'd been tossed to and fro in that rickshaw all day.  Not easy on the eyes, but a delight to the belly!  Wow, I couldn't believe how good it was.  Easily the best slice of pie I've had in my life.I've since learned that they deliver food one of 3 ways: food-truck, rickshaw or minivan.

I had some amazing vegan fare the day before at the Handlebar in Wicker Park, and was craving more.  I started playing with my Yelp app on my Blackberry and this came up. I like the idea of a food truck and the idea of not having to eat the same Hyde Park staples/not having to cook.  I saw that they took requests and thought I was taking a long shot in requesting Hyde Park. A minute later someone responded saying they'd be there in the next couple hours.Eventually I braved the winter cold and traveled to where they promised they'd be at 6pm. At exactly 6pm they showed up - thank goodness because it was cold and it was my first winter after moving up from Miami.  I got the BBQ loaf, mac & cheese, and greens meal ($10) and the buffalo \"chicken\" wrap ($7). The amount of food I got was good if you're not a big eater (i.e. if you eat how much you're supposed to eat vs how much most Americans, including myself oftentimes, eat) - I imagine most people who would be attracted to this type of thing will be plenty satisfied. I walked home and decided I would have the wrap now and the meal the next day at work. I take the wrap out and it looks so good... then my boyfriend accidentally calls, then my mom calls, and then my boyfriend calls again to make up for the accident (UGH I WANT TO EAT, but I love you, sweetie!). Finally....but wait [RING... RING... or really my Beyonce ring tone]... who else could call before I take my first bite?!  UGH boyfriend (still love you!) forgot to tell me something since I rushed him off the phone so I could eat.  Whatever, finally I get to eat... bite down and at first I'm pleasantly surprised.  Lots of flavor and great texture, but then.... HOLY SHIT is it spicy! So spicy that I actually ran to the fridge and took out a container of milk that I was sure was spoiled that I had bought for baking a month (or two) prior and never got around to throwing out. Thankfully it wasn't spoiled or maybe my mouth was burning so badly that I didn't care. Either way, totally not nice to not to warn a person... most people in the food service industry would warn someone that something is REALLY spicy (Not that I asked, but still). However, I went through all the trouble, so I saved the insides to mix with some brown rice later on hoping that this will make the spice manageable for me.  Now, if you like spicy this is great... like I said, it had a good flavor to it (before the fire in my mouth) and the texture was good. The BBQ loaf dinner was also very tasty... the mac n cheese wasn't very pretty, but it tasted good.  Cheap enough that I would have again, but not so cheap that I would have it often.  Also, I am NOT a vegan or even a vegetarian, but an open minded eater who occasionally likes to do something good for her body and planet.", "date": "Dec 8, 2010", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60637", "rating": 4.5}
{"resturant_name": "The Vegan Food Truck by Ste Martaen", "alias": "the-vegan-food-truck-by-ste-martaen-chicago-2", "text": "I got the Chicago Cheesesteak ($10), made with seitan and Ste Martaen three cheese sauce.  The sandwich looked a mess, but was truly delicious.  The seitan was wonderful, juicy and peppery and flavorful, and seemed to have been grilled or seared before being sliced into strips.  Honestly, it was some of the best seitan I've had anywhere.  The cheese sauce was pretty darn good for a dairy-free vegan cheese, although I wouldn't necessarily call it saucy.  It wasn't completely melted, but was soft, and had a mild flavor somewhere between American and cheddar cheese.  Certainly not a replacement for the real thing, but it filled the role in the sandwich nicely.  (Disclaimer: I am not vegan, and I love cheese more than most things in life.)  The sandwich was missing the promised grilled pablano peppers and onions, which was disappointing, but other than that, it really was delicious.  (And truly mammoth, as advertised.)Steph opted to get the BBQ Chik'n Pita ($7).  This was made with vegan soy protein \"chicken\" and topped with shredded Ste Martaen cheese.  The chik'n was, like the seitan, wonderful.  It was slightly crispy on the outside, and as Steph pointed out, the sweet and tangy barbeque sauce permeated perfectly throughout.  This was not simply tossed in the sauce, it had clearly been cooked in it, making a moist and flavorful protein.  As for the quality of the chicken substitute itself, after twelve years of vegetarianism I consider myself well-versed on the available vegetarian \"meat\" products on the market, and this is up there with the best of them.  It had a nice texture, with the grain that you expect in chicken, with a nice chicken flavor.  The cheese here I believe was meant to be cheddar, and was slightly sharper than that on the cheesesteak, and again certainly provided an impressive amount of cheesiness for a product made primarily of nuts.  The pita was not nearly as enormous as the cheesesteak, but still made for a nice meal.Both of these sandwiches were excellent.  If you live in the Chicago area, I definitely recommend checking them out, but even if you don't, they seem to travel around a lot, so give them a follow on Facebook and Twitter and see when they'll be near you.  My only real complaint was the lack of the veggies on my sandwich, but I'm going to give these guys the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was either a fluke, or that they ran out, which can happen to anyone.  That said, I have no qualms giving this vegan meal on wheels top marks.Full review: http://mattreviewsstuff.com/2012/02/26/ste-martaen/", "date": "Apr 2, 2012", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60637", "rating": 4.5}

{"resturant_name": "The Wrap Bar", "alias": "the-wrap-bar-chicago", "text": "Not ideal...Midway through todays errands, I decided I would need something light yet filling. In lieu of any one of the fried options readily available, I ventured to The Wrap Bar in hopes of finding something to meet this need. The establishment is on the west side of Cottage Grove, so the parking is on the street but there's a bus stop in front of it, be ware. The staff was pretty blunt & to the point, no warm fuzziness here. Plenty of tables to wait for your food but kind of chilly inside, so you may want to preorder to have the food ready upon arrival. Typical run-of-the-mill neighborhood sandwich shop. My issue with this establishment was the excessive amount of oil on my salmon wrap as well as on his Philly chicken wrap. The picture I provided is not half of the oil that was in the actual food container, or soaking through the sandwich wrapper. On top of this oil that I assume the salmon & chicken was cooked in, there had to be nothing less than 5 tablespoons of mayonnaise per wrap (mind you the salmon wrap was supposed to be a Caesar dressing).  The lettuce was completely wilted, most likely someone placed hot salmon fresh out of the oil on the lettuce without attempting to drain it, leading to this disaster. The salmon was under seasoned but there was no complaints on the seasoning of the chicken. All in all this venture was a disappointment. I couldn't recommend anyone actually try this establishment b/c a wrap is very basic so for it to be a complete miss, how could I ever trust any other dish?", "date": "Mar 9, 2023", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60411", "rating": 4.3}

I use to go here years ago when it was called Captain Hardtimes (I believe that was the name) Anyway, let me not go back to the past and stay right here in the present.We ordered the liver and onions with a side of rice and cabbage as well as a Half of Cornish Hen with mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans.All of it was good except for my cornbread muffin at first because it was hard as a hockey puck but they brought me another one and it was really good.I had the liver and it had me dancing in my seat($13.95).  It was flavored well and cooked to perfection.  I wanted more of the cabbage and rice but I didn't want to pay an additional $6 bucks for the side so I just enjoyed what I had and savored the bites.My boyfriend had the Cornish Hen and it was moist and very tasty(half order ($12.95).  The mashed potatoes were also very creamy and with the gravy it just took it to another level of deliciousness.  The green beans were good but I don't think they were fresh I believe they came from a can but that is just my guess I'm not for sure one way or the other.I really do hope people begin to comeback to this place because it is well worth it and on top of that we would be helping out our community and an establishment that has been helping our community for years.I also wish they had more than just lemonade and sweet tea but both were very good and the sweet tea well let's just say it is the real deal and McDonald's has nothing on them.The only thing I was disappointed about was they didn't have that mac n' cheese special I saw on the show.  I really wanted to try that as well as the blackened catfish dish the other Chief had made up.  The staff was friendly and I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.

{"resturant_name": "Italian Fiesta Pizzeria", "alias": "italian-fiesta-pizzeria-chicago-8", "text": "Some places don't even try.Recently I've restarted my search for a good pizza place since my current favorite one has diminished in quality. Italian Fiesta popped up on my radar. At first glance it looks like your typical hood pizzeria except some reviewers noted it might be black owned so I decided to take a closer look.I ordered twice from Italian Fiesta. The first time I ordered my standard test of a sausage & pepperoni pizza (if you can't get this right... you should not be making pizzas.) I also ran the gambit, ordering a meatball sandwich & catfish dinner. The second time I ordered I kept it small due to issues with the first by only ordering 2 canned drinks & a small pizza. Each order took almost 3 HOURS for my order to be delivered & the orders still arrived screwed up. Here are my thoughts:Overall Price - Standard prices. Scary cheap on some menu items. Limited menu.Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza:Presentation - This is definitely one of the misses. Some of the slices don't even have sauce or cheese or toppings on them. The pepperoni is not even on some parts of the pizza. It's baffling how on some parts of the pizza has six pepperoni stacked on top of one another as if they did not bother separating the pepperoni from the packaging. The aluminum foil is also halfway on. Terrible job. 1/5Taste -It definitely is not the best pizza in Chicago as some of the previous reviewers have stated. Not even top 20. The sauce is salty, the pepperoni has a strange tinge to its taste, its greasy beyond belief & the cheese is of average quality (definitely not fresh mozzarella or any italian brand I've ever tasted.) Some slices tasted like motor oil. For them to take about two hours to shove this out the door is beyond ridiculous. 2/5Meatball Sandwich:Presentation -A meatball sandwich with no sauce? what planet is this restaurant from? French bread looks nice & soft. The mozzarella is nicely browned & they piled it on. I paid for sweet peppers & they just went overboard with the peppers. Less peppers more sauce. 3/5Taste -The meatballs are dry which is one of the reasons why people put marinara sauce on the meatball sandwich. The meat mixture isn't that good as it's not seasoned very well if at all. There's nothing like a meatball sandwich that is dry as well as not very tasty which is a shame because the bread is good & the overall combination of everything would have made a great sandwich had it had some actual sauce. 2/5Catfish Dinner:Presentation -Breading is very thin & lackluster. Unexpectedly dry. 2/5Taste -The breading has a little spice to it which is most likely the black pepper. The fish is alright, nothing special. It's perfectly fried where the meat itself is neither fatty nor dry.Customer Service:My second time around it was nearly the EXACT same experience as the first. The order arrived over 2.5 hours late with no drinks & they took it upon themselves to substitute Italian Beef for the Ground beef I requested for the pizza. No call, no nothing. 1/5Conclusion:Overall, listen to the reviews. This place is unable to get a simple order out in under 2.5 hours. For them to have such a limited menu & offer this level of quality is unacceptable. I don't know how this place calls itself Italian fiesta when they can't even get the basics of Italian food right. Both of my orders had the exact same issues down to the foil only partially covering the pizzas. There are plenty of restaurants throughout Chicago that get 10x-20x the business this place gets & can get out orders on time, have great customer service, etc. so there is no excuse. I wish I would've cancelled my order when after the one hour mark. Luckily Italian Fiesta doesn't leave that much of a hole in your wallet.1 out of 5 stars", "date": "Jul 19, 2021", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60620", "rating": 2.1}

Instead they gave me half cheese and then bacon and sausage on the other side. I don't understand how people say this is the best pizza in Chicago, because honestly it was terrible. The crust was literally paperthin, there was barely any sauce at all, and the sauce also had no flavor. Then the pieces of meat also barely had any flavor. The cheese was kind of rubbery and definitely was not fresh mozzarella like other places use.  The cheese was very thin. This pizza was extremely pricey as well, ended up being $21.40 before tax, which is absolutely insane because it's no better then some frozen pizzas I could get for $7. Our pizza was pretty cold when we got it. This same exact pizza, at other restaurants in Chicago sell for probably around 12 bucks.

The eggs I ordered were delicious and full of flavor, leaving me satisfied and impressed. Additionally, the avocado toast that came with the wings was absolutely delightful. The combination of creamy avocado and seasoned wings made it a genuinely 5-star-worthy dish.Unfortunately, my experience took a downturn regarding the wait time and some other menu items. Waiting over two hours for my food, particularly chicken and waffles, was simply unacceptable. I understand that a busy restaurant can lead to delays, but an excessive wait time left me feeling frustrated and hungry.To add to my disappointment, the wings I ordered were excessively salty. While I understand that taste preferences can vary, the saltiness was overpowering and took away from the overall enjoyment of the dish. Moreover, the grits, which are typically savory, were surprisingly sweet. This unexpected twist didn't align with my expectations and left me longing for the traditional savory flavor that grits are known for.To improve the overall dining experience, I strongly recommend that Conscious Plates reevaluate their kitchen preparation and efficiency. Long wait times for certain dishes can discourage customers, and the restaurant must streamline its processes to provide a more timely service.While there were definitely highlights during my visit to Conscious Plates, the excessive wait time and inconsistent flavors prevented me from giving a higher rating.

I got one sandwich mild flavored and one sandwich hot flavored.  I also got the chicken tenders, elote and French Fries.  The chicken is juicy.

On its high days I give it a 4.25. It is not a bad place but sometimes food quality can fluctuate. I will rate the menu items I had individually and give a break down. The Tender Combo - Over all pretty good, but also pretty in offensive. The texas toast needs some improvement, it really isn't as good as it could be. I think they should look into browning the toast in the butter more, and both sides at that. The chicken itself is fine and sauce is good. The fries aren't offensive so they make a good side.The cheat day fries - I was honestly most excited about this menu item but was the most disappointed. There is just too much sauce going on in the fries and it makes it too soggy. The flavor of the cheese and sauce overwhelm the chicken and fries so it feels like you're just eating solids without really differing what solid you are eating. I think if they toned down how much sauce and cheese used it could help accentuate everything it has to offer rather than dull it.Mac N Cheese - It's not bad but if you are looking for ths taste and consistency of homemade mac n cheese you won't really get it with this item.

They allow the students to work the front and the back of a real live restaurant to gain the necessary experience to transition to a career in the food industry. The restaurant itself looks amazing! The ambiance was very appealing and the hostess was very polite. My wife and I did not know that you needed reservations but the hostess accommodated us. As she was explaining to us, the reason for taking reservations during the summer is due to the low volume of students they have and the amount of product they order. This is smart but something that I wish they were able to expand because so many people are missing out.  The food was amazing. The menu changes every 2-3 weeks. We had the corn bisque, shrimp kale salad, grilled tuna tostada, pad Thai, strawberry bread with vanilla bean ice cream and a pistachio cake with vanilla mousse and a caramel drizzle. These students did an amazing job. Although the meal is $8, they charge tax and a scholarship fee which I think is a great idea especially given the meal is inexpensive. For a soda or lemonade type drink it's about $2 and I believe you get free refills. They also do catering and I can see that venue being used for some amazing things. I will explore that option soon.

They are part of the Washburne Culinary Institute so the cooking, serving, etc. is all done by young people studying the hospitality business. Sikia is a Swahili word for a synthesis of sensory input, a nice interesting name for a dining room. Sikia features a lot of African dishes but on this occasion their Valentine's special menu sounded too good to pass up, a multi-course not particularly ethnic affair which I assume gave them a chance to practice various kitchen disciplines. On the appetizer sampler plate, we especially enjoyed the grape encased in goat cheese and rolled in pistachio. The salad featured grilled quail, how cool is that! This was followed by two, yes, two entrees: salmon with morel sauce (I'm tellin' ya!) on saffron risotto with asparagus; and lamb glazed with pomegranate molasses and fig, over mashed potatoes. OK, the execution was not entirely perfect, both could have been a little less cooked, but this was still a wonderful couple of courses and quite a deal. The lamb sauce was definitely one of the more interesting and delicious things we'd eaten in a long time. The triple whammy dessert was exciting too, a flourless chocolate cake, a peppery chocolate panna cotta, and a chocolate sorbet (attractively non-creamy). It's BYOB, though they did toss in a glass of some so-called champagne. Their interior decor is a bit on the dry side and could use some livening up and personality. But anyhow, we were impressed; it was a more than satisfying meal, very enjoyable for the special occasion, a surprising find a few miles south of us down Halsted, and it was our pleasure to sponsor in some small way these future chefs and restauranteurs (our server, for example, hoped to start a catering business after serving some apprentice time at a restaurant or two).", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60621", "rating": 4.3}

Ok so I was craving some jerk chicken and I looked on here and here is Tropic Island Chicken with a lot of stars, I also seen that they have delivery so I called and a male with a Jamaican accent picked up \"E-lo Tropic Chicken\" I then mentioned to him over the phone I wanted to make an order for delivery he respond with \"oh no no no he no work here no mo, he got tired of doing delivery\" then he abruptly hung up on me without seeing if I wanted to order or not. But no my fellow yelpers I was persistent so I got my boyfriend to wake up and take that drive to 79th just so I can taste the food and get a dinner for my mother. I get there and the place looked clean, the food was set up in like a steam table without a cover (but I guess steam tables don't come like that). they had a nive array of items but they looked sort of dried out or limp looking the chicken was in the back. I ordered 3 white chicken dinners at $34 each came with 2 sides, red beans and rice, and bread. we rushed home to see what we would get... and to our disappointment this is what we found:Jerk Chicken- had no jerk at all!, tasted like some ok BBQ chicken I could have made at home, the chicken was dry there was barely any chicken skin to have that jerk flavor I was looking for, the chicken looked good but didn't make the mark clearly wasn't worth my money or commute out there.Mac and Cheese: My boyfriend liked but I didn't tasted like butter and kraft mac and cheese hell deluxe tastes better than this mac they haveSteam cabbage- I love cabbage with all my heart but it has to be seasoned well with onion, and other seasonings and can't be too hard, this cabbage was tasteless and too hard like it was poorly under cooked I wanted cabbage not coleslaw like cabbage leaves damn it!!!red beans and rice- hard and not fluffy, dry, they poured gravy on it that didn't taste to good eitherYams- were ok not syrupy tasted like cinnamon was on there it was alrightBread- Yes I judge the bread because with jerk hicken I like my bread to be like a pound cake in taste and how thick and dense it should be, this bread was like a regular white bread slice!Overall all of our dinners were bogish, subpar,mediocre messes and I wasted my Honey's money on this find another place to get jerk chicken and not here!

Both rooms here have bars, which I thought was good(though I suspect the back doesn't have as much of a drink selection, as the front 'sports bar' area did, and since the bar in the back looked smaller).Finally, I thought it was pretty cool that just barely to the east of here, that a new shopping center opened up, that includes a Target.

After encountering that I thought Subway, but I was on the fence about trying the coffee at Subway then it dawned on me that there is a Starbucks location in the area. There is plenty of parking at this location because its complex is shared with a few other known businesses that rarely get congested even during peak hours!  Other than being greeted warmly by the employees my first impression after walking into this location is that it is gorgeous! Its layout slightly differs from other Starbucks locations but the items presented remain the same. I loved that it had African art hanging on the wall because it gives it a different vibe. It feels artsy and different with its built-in conference room inside which no other locations have. While sitting briefly enjoying my drink and dessert, I listened to blues music, taking in its interior and watching other customers utilize its WiFi, which is another perk to this location. If you are in a rush with no time to dine-in this location has a drive-thru attached which few Starbucks locations have in Chicago.As for my order, typically I get the cafe mocha but I forced myself to get something different which I ordered a caramel macchiato and a blueberry scone. I believe this is the first time I ever ordered the caramel macchiato, but overall I enjoyed it and will most likely get it again. Plus, I have no complaints about the timeline I received it.There is just something about the employee's that work at the businesses in this sector that show a tremendous amount of hospitality, which does not get acknowledged in neighborhoods like Englewood. It is heartwarming to see a neighborhood like Englewood having resources it deserves like this Starbucks, and Englewood Wholefoods, which sits diagonal. One thing I will never forget about visiting this location is the warm welcome I got by the employees after walking in which makes me anticipate visiting again because employee hospitality is contagious when you least expect it.

I expected angels with harps to greet me at the door the way that these reviews described the place.I'll tell you about the good things before the bad.  The service was very good.  The staff was attentive and treated us very well.  The venue itself was clean and felt like a nice place to recline.  I appreciated the off street parking and was able to find a space without a problem.Now with the bad.The layout of the place is buffet style.  The food is all on display for you to see, but there are servers there to dish out the food instead of you making your own plate.  I was expecting a larger selection of food, but when we went, there weren't that many meats available.  I think I saw baked fish, smothered chicken and pork chops, ox tails and barbequed beef ribs..which is what I got.  I couldn't resist them, they were so pretty...looks can be deceiving.  What happened to the fried chicken and fish?The selection of vegetables were sparse.  I saw collared greens, black eyed peas and corn.  There weren't any cabbages, or even garden salads.  They did have a large selection of desserts though.  Alright...the quality of food.The barbequed beef ribs were HORRIBLE.  Don't get me wrong, the sauce was delicious, and they looked delicious, but those were the toughest pieces of meat that I have ever had in my LIFE!  I couldn't even cut it with the knife at the table.  I had to ask the waitress for a sharper knife, and that didn't even work.  I didn't want to be rude and pick it up with my fingers and eat it with my mouth but I got desperate, and tried biting it and that didn't even work!  I couldn't tear the meat away from the bone!!  Let's just say that this put a huge damper on the meal itself.  I enjoyed other things, like the dressing and the greens...but the macaroni wasn't like the baked mac and cheese that your mother probably made.  The corn muffins were tiny to say the least and were so hard they could have been used as a weapon!  I had peach cobbler for dessert which is my favorite.  It tasted like someone broke up pieces of a biscuit or cornbread for the crust and mixed it in with the sauce.  Seriously, it was pretty bad.I liked how quiet the place was in general except for the gospel music that was playing in the background.  I'm guessing that the owner of the establishment was religious, but what they need to take into consideration is that everyone may not want to listen to gospel music while dinning out.  I think it would be nice to have neutral music playing in the background...something that would appeal to everyone, like FM Lite or something.My mom was there and said she loved the ox tails but didn't really care for anything else.  Overall, it wasn't a bad looking place to dine, but in this case the good doesn't out weigh the bad.Hmm, looks like I took longer than I thought.

So, I called the store and was contacted back by the store manager and after going through what happened and with her supposedly placing a test order, I was told that I'd must've made a mistake and didn't send my order through properly. After I'd tried to explain several times that I could prove it with the app's order receipt, the store manager became very combative and obnoxious and was talking loudly over me on the phone. I told her that I'm not trying to argue and would return right away with my phone and physical receipt to prove that I'd been overcharged by $3.09. When I got to the store, I asked for the store manager and waited over 15 minutes and she still didn't come to the counter. Eventually, another female member of the management team asked \"what was the problem?\", looked at the 2 receipts and immediately refunded the $3.09. Was that so hard?

Why are the McDonald's locations on the south side seem to lack in efficiency and professionalism? I'm used to locations(primarily in the suburbs) that are fast and efficiency is pretty stellar. Still the efficiency needs an overhaul and what is really the problem is that owners of McDonalds around my neighborhood seem to be having problems employing people who don't take their jobs seriously. They need to set better standards in their establishments and one is presentation meaning making sure that the food prep area is clean and floor is swept and mopped. I went to use their washroom and the bathroom was nasty with toilet paper on the floor and trash cans that needed to be emptied. If the owner of this McDonalds wants to keep decent business get on your staff to do their job and stop standing around running off their mouths and take some orders and get the customers orders ready.It never fails to see how hoody all the McDonalds are on the south side are and how you see too many are hiring young people to work there who don't take their jobs seriously by seeing them texting on the phone especially the cashiers which results in them putting the wrong order in and even giving customers back the wrong change because they're not paying attention to what they are doing. There's been other times I went through the drive thru and a young girl working the register was texting on her phone and took her a couple seconds to see I was sitting there.

I didn't know that the gentleman who was at the counter signing a receipt was actually the owner (who is black). I figured that he and his wife who own this McDonald's made changes after customers complained about the staff. The owner told me he was trying to give young African-Americans an opportunity to work and have a job. Apparently, that didn't seem to work because the crew(s) they had a few years back were not acting like professionals like you would come to the window and the girl was busy checking her phone and not paying too much attention to ringing up customers, This is how people's orders were getting messed up and having a backlog of customers coming in because their orders were wrong or missing items. Since then thing are different there's a better crew who are more attentive and actually more courteous. The owner this day even had to kick out a guy who came in looking through trash cans and acting erratic (likely a drug user) so that also showed he had little tolerance for the riff-raff in his store. I try to support the local businesses in my community, but we need more owners to step up and keep their places in order in terms of people they hire and allow to work there and keeping those who are a disturbance to other customers out. What's even better is they offer all day breakfast now which should have been done 15 years ago because that would have kept McDonald's up since Dunkin' Donuts has been doing the all day breakfast thing for some time so other places are following suit because with the way the world is going not everyone's work schedules are 9 to 5 and some people prefer eating breakfast foods at any given time of the day.", "date": "Oct 18, 2015Previous review", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60620", "rating": 1.8}

I actually had a phone conversation informing her that she needed to be more aware of who she has working at her establishment. The quality of the food is not that good because it seems like when you put a young high school age kid behind the grill you don't exactly get the best tasting stuff around. Half the items I got were either too salty or got too much of everything on it. The lack of professionalism with some of the employees was apparent when many of them were acting snide because they're on a minimum wage job that didnt pay a lot, and the lack of customer service is obviously lacking at this location. When it gets to the point where you have to tell the owner of their buisness that the people working for them are hoodrattish and ghetto that's a real sign they need to take a look at who they're actually hiring and look closer at the character of their employees because that also determines the level of service they give to customers.

I asked is there something that can be done and she asked me what do you want me to do? I asked what can you do! Her response was to send the delivery  guy back for the delivered pizza and to start the order over. I nearly lost it. This establishment is sooo unprofessional. Pizza was nasty and cold and definitely not worth the trouble or time.  1 star because at least someone has the brains to manually operate a phone or I couldn't post unless I gave an undeserved stat..", "date": "Dec 1, 2019", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60619", "rating": 2.3}

They gave me a thin layered pizza with a deep dish crust so the manager gave me a credit on my next order. Decided to use my credit today....first of all, the lady who took my order spoke to me as if I was illiterate and was very rude. She told that since I ordered extra ingredients it would be $4.08. I said okay, no problem.  Since it was a credit I had to pick it up....no big deal so she told me my pizza will be ready in 25 minutes. I get to the restaurant and was told that I couldn't use my card because there's a $5.00 limit so I add a pop. While the girl was taking care of me, the lady who took my order was talking about me (very loudly and clearly) because I used my card on a $4.08 order. She was saying, \"Who uses a card for a $4.00 order? You don't have $5.00 to pay for your pizza?\" I was in complete shock that she was talking about me in front of me even though it was to her co-workers.

Please don't start cutting corners now that you're established. I understand raising food prices, but the amount of food should not be compromised. Will I order again? Yes, but you all need to work on food continuity. Also, your bread option, our garlic bread portion was small, flavorless, and over cooked.

The food was so good I decided to bring my girlfriend for a bite to eat. When we got to the register the cashier was nice and I ordered us 2 Cajun salmon dinners. I was told to wait for a minute so she could check to see if they had enough of everything. She comes back and places our order for us which is the 2 salmon dinners. We go to my car to wait for a text that my food is done. After 25 minutes or so I walked in after not receiving a txt saying my food is done. I was told that they only had enough salmon for 1 salmon dinner. I'm Very Disappointed and Upset because not only did the cashier \"CHECK\" to see if they had enough salmon but also We was waiting 25 minutes without even a call to tell me they didn't have enough salmon.

I wasn't sure what she wanted so I got an order of filets and an order of catfish steaks. The workers were very nice and courteous. I got my the food and took it to my neighbor, she choose the filets and I got the catfish steaks. When I took out my fish, I noticed three of the pieces had a double coating and it was separated and hard. The fish looked rather old. I tasted the fries and they were hard, it was if they mixed fresh fries with old fries that had been recooked. I ate a few but then, stopped. I put some hot sauce on the fish and began eating it. I tasted the pieces that were double coated and it was hard, you could barely chew them. One piece looked like it had been left out, I pulled off the coating and it was so hard you couldn't even break it apart. There was one fresh piece and I ate that. An hour after eating the fish, I started feeling a little lightheaded. Wasn't sure what it was, then I had a slight headache. I drank me some tea and went to bed. The next morning, I woke up and was about to get out of bed and was feeling very dizzy, the room was spinning, I felt nauseous, my stomach was cramping and my heart was racing. I had been coughing up mucus all night but, diarrhea set in and I was gagging. I had to wind up calling my doctor. I told her everything that was going on and she said, I had food poisoning. She put me on bedrest and told me not to eat anything heavy and drink Gatorade for 24hrs. And, if things didn't get any better go to the emergency room.

(Hence the 3 stars instead of ONE for the CONTINUOUS RUDE ENCOUNTER). I just have a bad experience with the male bartender EVERY time I encounter him.  I typically come on Friday or Saturday nights, but I went on a Tuesday night this last time, since the NBA finals game 6 fell on a Tuesday.       Ok, so usually I avoid the light skinned male bartender at all costs and order drinks from any of the ladies that are always pleasant to deal with - heck they even speak and smile when they see me (yes I tip well)! So this night one of my friends (didn't know any better) asks HIM to make our drinks.  And since she was dealing with HIM directly and I wanted to see his attitude with her, I waited for the conversation to unfold naturally. She ordered her drink, and he came back with it and she proceeded to order 2 more drinks (mine and another friend of ours) he immediately snapped and told her to hurry up and she should have ordered all the drinks at one time! WOW..  She brushed it off & ordered the drinks.  I watched him across the bar make my drink with Patron instead of Don Julio (which is what she ordered for me). He also poured the other drink wrong too!  When he came over to us with the drinks she told him the errors and he said ok I'll remake the margarita, but you ordered this other drink wrong, and that's not my fault. O_O  I leaned in to tell him she wanted the Jack Daniels Honey instead of the reg Jack and could he be so kind to take care of that - he snapped at me and said she ordered this wrong, and next time maybe you should order your own drink! (FLOORED) I told him this was not my drink the margarita was, and as a matter of fact I don't even need you to remake my drink.      He immediately threw the incorrect Patron drink down the sink and said, \"No problem!\" (body language said the rest) I said to him, \"You are very rude\" and he said he didn't care!  I couldn't believe it! So he made her pay for the wrong Jack and when she asked for a glass of water he ignored her and walked back and forth past her w/o acknowledging her request ever!  I was so pissed at how rude he was, right in front of other customers too!  I walked away and ordered my drink from the lady on the opposite side of the bar - always pleasant.       Its sad to see a nice establishment with rude employees.  This is the type of thing that can make or break a business.  Customers are your paycheck!  You have to be accommodating to people paying their money - or they will go to a place that WILL accommodate them.  I hope the owner/management speaks to this man and he gets his act together, or let him go already! I'm sure I am not the only person who feels this way.  Maybe he's related to the management/owner and that's how he still has a job.  I hope to NEVER have to deal with this man EVER!

I've never seen a more intense as in rules and regulations in a karaoke place ( there maybe different themes on different  nights if so, i'm have a suspicious feeling they're regulating them as they did  this night ).  There's no script to karaoke, you do you, freelance, be it on the lyrics or ad lib.  Adjectives were used by a Sistah that was on the mic, and  she did apologize for them.. nothing a 30 & over crowd haven't heard  before ( teenager use worse ). Long story short, the karaoke dj approached and said you can't do that. He also approach another Sistah and told her she couldn't dance in the back round or sing with her friend.. WOW, the celebrities I know don't act like that.. Hood mentality..  After all that after thought drama.. the bartender had something to add, which was based on his emotions. He tried to explain, some body momma was in there ( relative to the owner or manager ) and you just can't say adjectives, out of respect. Now it's wasn't harsh like that. Never the less, this is a public establishment and if ya' momma haven't heard this by now,, well lets just say \" she frontin\".. smh.. Oh, after all that, he wouldn't give  the same Sistah a glass of water ( she paid for several drinks ).  He said the lights were on and he couldn't give any drinks.. It's water not alcohol.  So  I ordered some water and the Sistah behind the bar gave it to me and I gave it to the Cutie with the adjectives..lol.. All she could say was Wow, in regards to the bartender and i think the whole night.. so on  that note. to my New Yorkers, Cali crew, Floridian people..  I would advise to skip this venue and try somewhere more people / out of town friendly environment. If you ever end up here just smile at the fair skin bartender with the under the lip piercing. He's the emotional guy that likes to play tuff with females and refuse to give them water when they have been spending their $$$ there. Also if ya' momma is in the house please remember this is a public establishment and we are paying our $$$. SO IN ALL REALITY WE KEEP THIS SHIT OPEN not Ya' MOMMA/ No disrespect intended . I just saying, people can make you and when you treat them with DISRESPECT, you break ya'self...Bystander listening to the whole scenario..

We had the black bean burger and the estovich fish with garlic mash potatoes, string beans, and a carrot \"mash\". I forgot the actual name of it. The garlic mash potatoes definitely need more garlic. It wasn't enough. I barely taste it. The carrot dish was good to me. I read some negative reviews about it but I enjoyed it. I wish my fish was spicy, just my liking. Overall,the dish was light but filling.  My daughter devoured her black bean burger and she's a kid. We ordered cheesecake to go and it did not disappoint.", "date": "Nov 24, 2023", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60649", "rating": 3.9}

Took a bus a little south of my house, and wound up at a very cutely named place. I instantly knew I had to go in! And from that very day, I was not disappointed!!!First off, on weekdays, they have specials, which you can order a whole meal for under $13!!! And I'm talking about delicious, home-cooked soul food... like the stuff I had in Tennessee and Missouri. It honestly feels like somebody's Mamma and Papa made it. Everybody there is so polite and fun to talk to... And they always make room for you. Like the second time I came in, I brought The Boy (), and while the dining room was full, they got us some menus and let us sit in the to-go waiting area. Top-tier quality service right there!! The whole place also has a very neighborhood/community feel- decorated with Harlem Renaissance art and jazz musicians. They even have a live piano bar (but I never remember what days; I just so happened to be there by chance).The only downside of this place (if there ever was one) is that it fills up quickly... But they offer to go/online delivery, and there are plenty of parks/the lakefront you can go to. Otherwise, the food gets made in a timely manner... and I was never starving while there. ;)They also have amazing vegetarian and vegan options, as well as the best desserts you've ever had!!! That carrot cake was to die for, and the bf and I are dying to try that peach cobbler (which I've been told is super popular!). Everything is so well priced, and the portions are amazing! I've always left with plenty of leftovers, even on days when I was STARVINGGGG.Well done y'all!!! You already know Imma keep bringing my friends here.", "date": "Aug 24, 2023", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60649", "rating": 3.9}

Add bean pie for dessert. Man, my chops have been waiting for this place.

{"resturant_name": "Let’s Eat to Live", "alias": "let-s-eat-to-live-chicago", "text": "I tried Let's Eat to Live when I saw they delivered through GrubHub.  I always complain that there aren't enough options for healthy eating in local restaurants.  So I was intrigued by the name and placed an order.  I ordered the Red Lentil Soup with Apricots.  It was rich and satisfying but still light.  The fruit gave the soup a bright taste that complimented the tomato scented base.  I also tried their barbecued chicken with sweet coconut rice, smoked salmon flecked mustard greens and something called carrot fluff.  WOW!  Where do I start?  The rice was studded with shaved coconut which gave it a pleasant toothiness, the mustard greens were spicy and complex and the carrot fluff was smooth, silky and reminiscent of sweet potatoes.  All in all an amazing meal.  Give them a try you won't regret it.", "date": "Nov 30, 2022", "is_closed": false, "address": "Chicago, IL 60649", "rating": 3.9}

Unfortunately I'm not able to give any type of review because my food order was NEVER delivered. My coworkers and I placed and order and was told the delivery time would be between 1:20-1:30. By 2:00 and still no food, I tried contacting the business; however, the lines were always busy. By the time my colleagues and I left work at 3:40 we still were left with out our food and very much hungry. To make matters worse, I was charged for food we NEVER received.
