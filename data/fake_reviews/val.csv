"I frequent XO quite often and always have a good experience! I do a lot of working/reading/studying/catching up here and it's such a great environment to do so! Their coffee selection is amazing, but what I come for is the tea that they have. They make a really delicious hibiscus iced tea that is very refreshing and have a lot of other tea varieties to chose from. The food next door (that's connected) sage & onion cafe, has amazing food that you can order and they will bring it over to your seat. 

The decor is very cute and unique, the place is always clean with friendly baristas and locals popping in and out. I would definitely recommended someone to make this their next go-to place to visit and catch up on some reading!

"Been here many time and never lets me down. Fast, friendly service and good pub style menu. This place has an outdoor eating area with its own bar. Great place to hang out anytime of the year. The restaurant inside is cozy and inviting. I brought my dad and teenage son there and they loved it. The couple next to us had a little girl who had her birthday and staff brought a cake with a big sparkler and she loved it. Just wanted to mention it because I thought it was very thoughtful. Great in house beer selection for every taste. They also had several new seasonal sections that look equally delicious. Overall great place and look forward to my next visit.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Spirits On Bourbon, and let me tell you, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a vibrant atmosphere that immediately set the tone for a memorable evening.

The menu at Spirits On Bourbon is extensive and offers a wide variety of options to choose from. Being a seafood lover, I couldn't resist indulging in their famous Cajun Seafood Pasta, and let me just say, it was out of this world. Every bite was bursting with flavor, with a perfect balance of spices that left me wanting more.

The service was impeccable, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure a fantastic dining experience. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about their craft. From recommending the perfect wine pairing to providing excellent suggestions for dessert, they made sure that every detail was taken care of.

One of the highlights of my visit was definitely the live entertainment. Spirits On Bourbon is not only a restaurant but also a lively music venue. The band kept the energy high throughout the night, creating a fun and memorable atmosphere. It was the perfect accompaniment to the delicious food and excellent company.

The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting. The dim lighting and rustic decor added to the overall charm and created a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. It was the perfect setting for a date night or a casual get-together with friends.

Overall, my experience at Spirits On Bourbon was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of delicious food, outstanding service, and lively entertainment made it a night to remember. Whether you're craving mouthwatering seafood or looking for a fun night out, this restaurant is a must-visit. I wholeheartedly recommend Spirits On Bourbon and give it a well-deserved rating of 5 stars out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"At Royal House, my culinary journey was nothing short of regal perfection. Upon entry, the ambiance transported me to an era of grandeur and elegance. Each course unfolded like chapters in a best-selling novel, tantalizing my taste buds and leaving a lingering desire for the next bite.

The starter, a delicate bouquet of pan-seared scallops perched atop a bed of beautifully seasoned puree, was a symphony of flavors that played a harmonious prelude to the main event. The succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare steak followed, encrusted with a peppery char that locked in the most divine juices, resting on a throne of golden potato gratin that melted on my palate.

Dessert was a masterpiece - a decadent chocolate fondant that oozed with a rich, velvety lava of cocoa goodness, crowned with a quenelle of homemade vanilla bean ice cream. It was the final brushstroke on this canvas of culinary artistry.

The impeccable service mirrored the meal - attentive, precise, and discreetly present. The sommelier's recommendations were spot on, enhancing each dish with a carefully selected wine that complemented every nuance of the flavors. 

In every aspect, Royal House left an indelible mark of excellence. I departed with more than just a satisfied appetite; I left with the memory of a dining experience that sets the bar for gastronomic brilliance, earning it an unequivocal 5-star accolade.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Baileys' Chocolate Bar is a unique and cozy dessert spot in St. Louis. I had a decent experience but have a few mixed feelings about the place.

The atmosphere is quite charming, especially the patio area. It's perfect for a girls' night out or a romantic date. However, the confusion with the name ""Baileys"" was off-putting. It's not Bailey's Irish Cream, but rather a different Mr. Bailey. This can be a bit confusing for customers.

The wait time was reasonable, considering we arrived after a hockey game. The host was friendly and efficient in seating us. The back room was comfortable and had an intimate ambiance. We were treated to delicious chocolate chip cookies as a welcome treat.

Our waitress was friendly, but seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables she had to handle. This resulted in a delay in taking our order. However, she made up for it with her warm demeanor.

The highlight of the evening was the drinks. I highly recommend trying the Santa Martini. It had mint chocolate ice cream, cinnamon, vanilla vodka, and other delicious ingredients. It was a heavenly indulgence. They also had a tempting lemon drop martini, but it's hard to resist chocolate at a chocolate bar.

The desserts, on the other hand, were a bit disappointing. They were enormous and difficult to finish. The brownie was good, but not outstanding. The banana bread was fantastic, although it had an excessive amount of ice cream.

In the end, I would return to Baileys' Chocolate Bar for their delightful martinis. However, I would be cautious when ordering desserts and ensure to inquire about portion sizes. Overall, it was a decent experience, but not exceptional.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
Terribly slow service. They had 2 people working. I got there around 9:20 am on a Saturday and didn't get to order my drink until 9:35. I have no clue why there was so little staff in a cafe in a heavily populated area on a Saturday morning.,HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I don't know why people aren't talking about this place, it was super clean, fresh and reasonably priced!  What I loved the most was the fact that I could get one or two chimichanga's instead of 1 giant one.  Also, I asked our server for the chicken fajita chimichanga, but not fried (I like the sauce better than a burrito) and he seemed a bit confused, then understanding, but then he still sent another server over to clarify just in case he hadn't heard me properly.  To me, that was spectacular service!!!
My husband had 3 tacos, 1 chorizo (YUM!), 1 pork (OMG!!!!!) and 1 steak....everything was so fresh and delicious.  The margaritas were a little too processed, but the food is more important to me than the drinks and I was incredibly pleased.

"The Continental Mid-town impresses once again! From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was electric, modern yet cozy. We were greeted warmly by the host and quickly shown to our table. The service here is impeccable; attentive without being intrusive.

Starting with the exquisite craft cocktails, each sip was a fusion of flavors, perfectly balanced. The menu offers an inventive twist on classic dishes; we savored every bite from the appetizers to the main course. The standout was the truffled mac 'n' cheese – a creamy, decadent delight with just the right amount of truffle.

The atmosphere is lively, and the quirky retro decor makes for a unique dining experience. It's the kind of place that perfectly matches great food with a great vibe, making every meal memorable.

It's a culinary gem in the city, suitable for an intimate dinner or a casual gathering with friends. The Continental Mid-town not only met but exceeded my high expectations. A five-star experience I highly recommend!",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Hudson's is one of my preferred bar chains. The food tends to be of good quality and this is the only place I have found in the city thus far that has Pilsner's on tap. So, I was rather disappointed that this location did not have it - I ordered a bottle instead. There was nothing else on tap which really interested me, except for Guinness. If I am going to end up drinking Pilsner from a bottle, I would rather go to Avenue Pizza around the corner. That being said, there is all the great atmosphere and excellent menu of the other Hudson's locations I have been in. I would come again for a meal, but may plan to drink something other than beer.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Probably my least favorite thing I did in New Orleans. It was a boring boat tour with a guide that had the strangest accent. It felt like he was slurring through the entire two hour tour. Not very interesting insights either and it was so freaking hot on the boat I was just trying not to pass out from the heat and humidity. They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy, I'd skip this one if I were you.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At Costco Wholesale, the culinary journey was unexpectedly delightful. The food court is a hidden gem, offering much more than just bulk groceries. The pizza has a perfectly crisp crust with delectable, gooey cheese, while the hot dogs are an unbeatable savory treat—and let’s not forget the berry smoothie, a refreshing conclusion to the feast. Despite its bustling nature, the seating area was clean and the service remarkably swift. An unorthodox dining venue, sure to surprise and satisfy!

I have also found this location to have the most consistent preparation of the menu items of the other Paneras I have ordered from - especially when it comes to the Green Goddess Cobb (It's the best salad, in my opinion. Pro tip: sub regular red onion for pickled red onion). Because of the high volume of traffic this store receives, be advised they can sometimes run out of or run low on certain breads, bagels, and bakery items. I have seen this happen most frequently on ""bagel tuesdays"". All in, I love Bread Co. and love this location. It's always busy but parking is a breeze.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"My evening at The Continental Restaurant and Martini Bar left me with mixed feelings, thus the middle-of-the-road three-star rating. The ambiance of the place claimed my first impression; chic and vibrant, it promised a dynamic dining experience.

The martini menu was extensive, with a creative twist on each concoction that I appreciated. A 'Lavender Martini' caught my eye, and it did not disappoint. Perfectly mixed, with subtle hints of herbal essences that graced my palate without overwhelming it.

However, when it came to the culinary side, The Continental performed inconsistently. The appetizer, Crispy Calamari, was a delightful start - light and airy with just the right amount of crunch, paired with a tangy dipping sauce that was a hit at the table. But as we transitioned to the main courses, the excitement dwindled.

My companion's Steak Frites was adequately flavorful, but the meat's doneness missed the requested mark of medium-rare, leaning more towards medium-well. My own Seared Salmon, although cooked to a pleasant pink center, was let down by a lackluster, somewhat soggy skin that lacked the appealing crispiness I'd anticipated.

The staff was courteous, but not as attentive as one might expect from a bustling urban establishment. We experienced a few delays and had to signal for service more than once, which, while not disastrous, did detract from the overall experience.

In conclusion, The Continental offers a lively spot for a drink with a backdrop of unique ambiance and decor. However, when it comes to food and service, it falls into the realm of the ordinary. For those seeking remarkable cocktails in a stylish setting, this might be your haven. If it's culinary excellence you're after, your quest might have to continue elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Wow, what a hidden gem! I stumbled upon Saint Cecilia on Yelp and after seeing the pictures and reading the reviews, I knew I had to give it a try. I'm a huge fan of chicken and waffles, so I was immediately drawn in. 

After waking up early and taking a 15-minute walk, I can confidently say that it was well worth it. The chicken was perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the waffles were the perfect accompaniment. To my delight, they even topped it off with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream. The combination was unbelievably delicious.

But wait, there's more! We also tried the stuffed French toast and it was nothing short of heavenly. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and every bite was filled with a delightful mixture of flavors and textures. Trust me, it's a must-try.

Overall, my experience at Saint Cecilia was outstanding. From the attentive service to the incredible food, everything was top-notch. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. I give it a solid 5 stars out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Review 1: I had a disappointing experience at Culina Mill Creek. The service was extremely slow and inattentive. We waited for almost 30 minutes before our order was taken, and another 45 minutes for our food to arrive. When the food did come, it was lukewarm and lacked flavor. The presentation was also quite poor, with sloppy plating and a lack of attention to detail.

The menu options were limited and the prices were on the higher side, considering the quality of the food. The portion sizes were small, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and hungry.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was also disappointing. It was very noisy, making it difficult to hold a conversation. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable.

"I came as a tourist. So take this review as you will, but .......

Totally Authentic. 

I came here a number of times during my stay in NOLA. If the music wasn't good, it was great. And they always had plenty of Abita.

When I was there, Uncle Babtiste from the Treme Brass Band was one of maybe 12 other people in the crowd. And the band talked him up on stage where they did an impromptu version of Shake, Rattle & Roll as he buzzed, hummed, and sang the notes and pantomimed a trombone with his cane... The crowd went crazy, and I was in awe. Admittedly, I only knew who he was after I recognized him on an episode of Treme and asked my dad. 

Overall, I had a great time in that whole section of Frenchman Street. Praline Connection, Snug Harbor, and a number of other clubs, bars, parks and restaurants over there kept me pretty entertained and enchanted with the city.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
Nice bar with a good selection if beers and food. Came here for pliney the younger which was handled very well.

"I frequent this location for quick, casual meals and unique drinks. My go-to meal option is the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese and it seldom disappoints. Today, I ordered that and a Mango Hennessey drink that I haven't seen on the menu before. The meal was delicious, as expected, and the drink was stronger than expected! It took me a while to take it down but I wasn't leaving until I did, being that it was nearly $10. 

My daughter and her friend were with me and ordered the Classic Combo Appetizer and a rather expressive Shrimp and Lobster Pasta. It must've been good though, because she cleaned the entire plate! I do wonder, however, when Friday's will settle on what type/style of potato skins to serve. They have changed them at least 4 times that I can count. I don't care for the current style. They're too bulky and dense and don't have enough surface area for the cheese and bacon bits.

Our server, Jasmine, was kind, fast and efficient. We were seated right away and got in and out of there pretty quickly. I was disappointed that an offer I'd received via my Friday's app mysteriously disappeared once I'd arrived at the location. I also witnessed my Friday's Rewards Points drop from 30 to 29 right before my eyes, but I'll report that issue via the app. At any rate, I will return and hope for another good experience on my next visit.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

From the moment you step into the enchanting outdoor space, you're greeted by an oasis of greenery that invites relaxation. The ambiance strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, making it an ideal setting for any occasion.

The menu offers a symphony of flavors that showcase a refined take on American cuisine. The dishes are crafted from fresh, locally sourced ingredients that sing with seasonality. I was particularly impressed by the succulent seared scallops; they were beautifully presented and melted in the mouth. The accompanying sides were equally delightful, elevating the entire dining experience.

The service was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely hospitable, ensuring that every aspect of the meal was enjoyable. The waiters were quick with recommendations, pairing each course with a perfect wine selection.

What truly sets Harper's Garden apart is its dedication to creating a complete sensory experience. Every sip of their handcrafted cocktails felt like a toast to the good life, and the desserts were a sweet crescendo to an unforgettable evening.

"I always get excited about seeing a somewhat healthy fish sandwich on a bar menu. The menu description of the blackened mahi wrap sounded better than it tasted. It wasn't bad, it was just A-okay. I expected something blackened to be, well, blackened. You know, with flavor and stuff. 

My boyfriend had the pulled pork and though he found it satisfying, like I did my wrap, it wasn't anything that made you want to go back.

The claim they have really good burgers, but where are the veggie burger options?!? The best burger places do have beef, turkey and veggie options. This place sadly does not. 

It's a cute little comfortable local restaurant / bar. Lots of tables, booths, tvs, friendly bartenders. They have a few outdoor tables, so there is a covered outside seating but Its just a parking lot view. You see everything from families to bar flies. Nothing shady and nothing too romper-room either.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Tenn Sixteen is an absolute gem of a restaurant! From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with warm smiles and a cozy, inviting atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home.

The menu at Tenn Sixteen is a delightful fusion of flavors, and I was spoiled for choice. After much deliberation, I decided to start with the shrimp and grits. Let me tell you, it was a game-changer. The de-veined shrimp were cooked to perfection and paired beautifully with the flavorful pieces of sausage. The smooth, well-seasoned sauce brought all the elements together, creating a dish that was truly unforgettable. The portion size was generous, and I even had enough to share with my dining companion.

For my main course, I opted for the meatloaf. Now, I must confess, I'm not usually a sauce person, but the sauces accompanying the meatloaf were absolutely delicious. The meatloaf itself was moist, tender, and full of flavor. It was clear that the chef had put a lot of love and care into crafting this dish.

One surprising highlight of the meal was the deviled eggs. I'm not typically a fan, but the varieties offered at Tenn Sixteen were worth trying. Each one was unique and bursting with flavor. I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed them.

The only minor disappointment of the meal was the mashed potatoes. While they were decent, they didn't quite live up to the high standards set by the rest of the dishes. However, this was a small blemish on an otherwise dynamite meal.

Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience at Tenn Sixteen. The food was exceptional, the service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. I will definitely be returning to try more of their tantalizing menu items. If you're in the area, I highly recommend giving Tenn Sixteen a visit.

"Nestled in the bustling heart of the city, Amelia's offers a gastronomic experience that almost seamlessly blends elegant ambiance with a palette of flavors that cater to the gourmet enthusiast. My journey through Amelia's offerings was a delight with only minor hiccups, leading to a solid four-star rating.

Upon arrival, guests are greeted by a thoughtfully curated interior that boasts a comfortable yet refined atmosphere. One couldn't help but notice the care put into the small touches, from the polished tableware to the soft, ambient lighting that set the stage for an intimately immersive dining experience. The seating was promptly arranged, and I was soon perusing a menu abundant with locally sourced ingredients and innovative dishes.

The starter that heralded the beginning of the culinary journey was the chef's signature appetizer, a delicate arrangement of seared scallops atop a bed of pureed cauliflower. Each bite was a testament to exquisite texture and balanced seasoning—a clear highlight of the meal.

Moving on to the main course, I settled on the braised lamb shank, which promised bold flavors. The dish, when it arrived, was a vision of rustic plating aesthetics. Tender to the fork, the lamb fell off the bone, suggesting a perfect slow-cooking process. However, the accompanying root vegetables were somewhat underseasoned, leaving room for improvement in an otherwise splendid ensemble.

One cannot conclude a review of Amelia's without lauding the exceptional service provided. Staff members were attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable about the menu, and readily provided recommendations that demonstrated genuine enthusiasm for the diner's experience.

Dessert was a dance of sweetness and texture—Amelia's take on a chocolate mousse with a crunch of hazelnut brittle. If heaven had a flavor, this dish would likely be it. The parting sip of a finely brewed espresso provided a warm, aromatic finish to an enjoyable meal.

In the continuous quest for culinary perfection, my experience at Amelia's was noteworthy. The minor detail of the seasoning issue with the vegetables was the only setback in an otherwise flawless dining adventure. Nonetheless, Amelia's is a gem hidden in plain sight, achieving a dining harmony that rightly earns it its stars. Whether for a special occasion or a simple desire to spoil one's taste buds, Amelia's warrants a visit and a canvas for the senses.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Chima Steakhouse is a must-visit for meat lovers! I had an outstanding experience and would highly recommend it. The restaurant's decor is stunning, creating a great ambiance for a memorable dining experience.

The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the meat. The servers brought a wide selection of cuts to our table and flawlessly sliced it right in front of us. Each piece was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. Being a non-meat eater, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.

In addition to the delicious meat, they also served some delightful salmon and chicken wrapped in bacon. These dishes provided a nice alternative for those who may not be big beef fans. I appreciated the variety offered on the menu.

However, I must admit that the salad bar was a bit disappointing. Compared to the outstanding meat options, it fell short. The assortment on offer was nothing exceptional, and some of the items were overly spicy or seemed out of place. It didn't detract from my overall experience, but I would have preferred a more diverse and better-executed salad bar.

Overall, Chima Steakhouse exceeded my expectations and provided an exceptional dining experience.

"At Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint, the promise of finger-lickin' barbecue was fulfilled. Greeted by the alluring aroma of smoked meat, I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance struck a chord with its rustic charm, balancing a casual dining vibe with just a hint of a bustling Southern kitchen. The service was prompt and hospitable, enhancing the overall dining experience.

Starting off with their smoked wings, the flavors were smoky and robust, leaving a lingering hint of applewood with each bite. For the main event, the pulled pork plate, accompanied by a side of mac n’ cheese and vinegary slaw, was executed beautifully. The pork, tender and juicy, pulled apart effortlessly, harmonizing with the tangy house-made barbecue sauce.

The mac n’ cheese was rich and comfort-food personified, though I found myself craving a bit more of a crispy breadcrumb topping. The slaw offered a refreshing contrast to the heaviness of the meat and cheese, though its sharpness might not suit all palates.

Dessert brought forth a warm, decadent pecan pie. It was a sweet end to the meal, but I admit it played second fiddle to the barbecue mastery I had just witnessed.

My only critique lies in the slight wait time before being seated and served, a minor hiccup in an otherwise splendid meal.

In summary, Martin's earns a solid four out of five stars, falling just shy of perfection. Their mastery of barbecue is undeniable, making it a joint well worth frequenting for those slow-cooked, smoky delights.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently visited Drybar in Indianapolis and I have to say, it was quite a disappointing experience. I had heard good things about this place, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.

Firstly, the service was extremely poor. The staff seemed disinterested and unengaged with their customers. It took forever for someone to acknowledge my presence, and when they finally did, there was no warm welcome or friendly attitude. It was a struggle just trying to communicate my preferences for my hair. Clearly, customer satisfaction was not a priority for the staff.

Moving on to the actual hair service, I was again left unimpressed. The stylist seemed rushed and did not pay attention to detail. I had asked for a specific hairstyle, but instead, I was given something completely different. It was clear that the stylist did not listen to what I wanted and just did their own thing. The end result was a disaster, with my hair looking nothing like what I had envisioned. I left feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with the outcome.

In terms of ambiance, the place was quite average. The atmosphere felt cold and impersonal, and the music was too loud, making it difficult to hold a conversation. Additionally, the seating arrangement felt cramped, with little privacy between clients.

Furthermore, the prices at Drybar were quite high considering the quality of service provided. I expected a premium experience, but instead, I received subpar service that was not worth the hefty price tag.

Overall, I would not recommend Drybar in Indianapolis. The poor service, lack of attention to detail, and high prices make it an unpleasant and unsatisfactory experience. There are certainly better options out there that offer superior service and value for money.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ollie's Bargain Outlet, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Despite my initial skepticism, this restaurant exceeded my expectations in several ways.

Firstly, the ambiance was unexpectedly charming. The colorful decor created a lively and inviting atmosphere. It was clear that the owners had put thought into creating a comfortable space for their guests.

The menu offered a good variety of options, ranging from classic comfort food to more adventurous dishes. I opted for their signature burger, and I was not disappointed. The patty was juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The toppings were fresh and complemented the burger perfectly.

The service was friendly and efficient. The staff seemed knowledgeable about the menu and were quick to address any questions or concerns. I appreciated the attentiveness of our server, who made sure our drinks were promptly refilled and checked on us throughout the meal.

One area where I felt there could be improvement was the wait time. While it wasn't overly long, it was noticeable. However, considering the quality of the food and service, it was a minor inconvenience.

Overall, Ollie's Bargain Outlet provided a great dining experience. With its pleasant ambiance, delicious food, and attentive service, it is certainly a restaurant worth visiting. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars and plan to return in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"At the heart of Historic Soulard, Mission Taco Joint blends modern flair with a laid-back vibe, creating an atmosphere that's both electric and comfortable. My evening kicked off with a colorful burst of flavors, thanks to their house margaritas, which were perfectly balanced - not too sweet, yet potent enough to set the scene.

The taco menu exhibits a creative twist on traditional fare, showcasing an array of unique ingredients that align with the spirit of innovation evident throughout the establishment. The Carne Asada taco was a standout, with its tender, flavorful beef complementing the tang of fresh lime and cilantro. The Baja Fish Taco also deserves applause for its light, crispy batter and the refreshing crunch of cabbage slaw.

Not everything was flawless, though. The Charred Cauliflower Taco, while a valiant vegetarian option, fell short of the others, lacking a distinct punch. It was missing the vibrancy that adorned its meaty counterparts.

Service was attentive without being overbearing, striking that delicate balance of being there when needed, yet granting space to dine in peace. Little touches, like quick plate clearances and timely water refills, helped maintain a seamless dining experience.

Ambiance is undeniably a strong suit for Mission Taco Joint - Historic Soulard. The murals and rustic-industrial decor fostered a welcoming environment that resonated with chilled beats pulsing in the background.

All in all, my visit was a delightful foray into a fusion of classic and contemporary Mexican cuisine. While there’s a sliver of room for improvement, particularly with the vegetarian offerings, the overall experience holds merit, earning a well-deserved four stars.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"This restaurant has some of the most unique food that you will find in New Orleans, and I love it.  There were two appetizers in particular that I will be craving for a long time.  There ceviche ice cream cones (yes, ceviche and ice cream - it works, trust me) and sweet potato beignets are two of the best appetizers I have had... EVER.  Get them both and thank me later. We also got the artichoke crawfish appetizer and it was really good, though I was still savoring the other two.  I would have given this restaurant a five star review just based on the appetizers though we did have dinner as well.  I got the quail which was exceptional and my guest got a pasta dish that I already forgot.  I will be back for the appetizers for sure though I may try other entrées.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"This place was a neat classic to visit! Our Lyft driver recommended this place to us and we dined here for breakfast. They have a variety to chose from and tif you like eggs Benedict, definitely get the Peacemaker. You get the option of trying two different Benedict's! I thought this was unique and excellent for someone such as myself who was torn between two different ones to order.
I ended up getting the Eggs Cochon and the Corned Beef Bernie. The corned beef was my favorite for sure! I also got an extra side of Hollandaise Sauce to add to my Benedict if I needed to. It came in handy since I love sauce! 
We enjoyed Creamy Vanilla Iced Coffee and it was great! I would get this again for sure! The staff were very helpful and nice which was great for us considering we weren't locals and had questions.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review: I recently dined at Courtside Grille and had an outstanding experience. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was lively and inviting. The restaurant had a great sports vibe, perfect for catching a game with friends.

The service was top-notch. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, making sure our drinks were always filled and checking in on us throughout the meal. She was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations.

Speaking of the menu, there were so many tempting options to choose from. I decided to go for the Courtside Burger, and it did not disappoint. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection, and the toppings added just the right amount of flavor. The portion size was generous, leaving me satisfied but not overly stuffed.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the presentation and taste of the food. Each dish looked like a work of art, and the flavors were well-balanced and delicious. It was evident that the chefs took pride in their creations.

The prices at Courtside Grille were reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and service. I left feeling like I had received a great value for my money.

Overall, I give Courtside Grille a perfect 5-star rating. The combination of fantastic food, attentive service, and lively atmosphere made for an unforgettable dining experience. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great spot to enjoy a meal with friends or catch a game.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Noodle 42 is a hidden gem tucked away in a strip mall, and I'm so glad I discovered it! The restaurant is spotless and has a vibrant atmosphere. I've been here twice now and both times were fantastic. 

On my first visit, I tried the #20 dish, which is beef in a satay broth. It was a delightful surprise! The addition of peanuts and tomatoes gave it a unique and delicious flavor. I actually prefer it over regular pho broth, so I'll definitely be back for more.

During my second visit, I opted for #11, a combination of shrimp and beef in a sour beef broth. It was tasty, but not as outstanding as the satay broth.

Service at Noodle 42 was prompt and attentive. They even checked in on us to ensure we were enjoying our meals, which is a rare occurrence at other pho restaurants.

"Restaurant Review: Southgate Centre (4 stars)

I recently visited Southgate Centre and I must say, it has a lot to offer. Although I don't frequent this mall as much as others, such as Kingsway, I still find it to be a great place to shop. With most high-end retailers, Southgate Centre is the go-to place to upgrade your wardrobe, whether you're a man or a woman. However, if you prefer more affordable options like me, there are stores like Stitches and Reitmans that cater to a wider range of budgets.

One of the highlights of Southgate Centre for me is the variety of specialty stores like the science shop and groovestone. These unique retailers are not commonly found in other malls, especially not in West Edmonton Mall. The fact that Southgate Centre attracts less crowds and offers better parking options makes it a more appealing choice for many Edmontonians.

Another impressive aspect of Southgate Centre is its food court. The array of options available is truly impressive, and I found the staff to be hardworking and the space to be sparkling clean. It's a big draw for shoppers who are looking for a quick and satisfying meal during their shopping spree.

I must point out that if Southgate Centre had more sit-down dining options besides State and Main, it would deserve a five-star rating from me. As someone who is always on the lookout for a unique dining experience, the current options are a bit limiting. However, it's worth noting that if I were in a higher income bracket, Southgate Centre would easily become my primary shopping destination, and I would significantly reduce my visits to West Edmonton Mall.

Overall, Southgate Centre deserves a solid four-star rating. It offers a great selection of high-end retailers, unique specialty stores, a clean and diverse food court, and a convenient shopping experience. With a few improvements in its dining options, it has the potential to become a five-star mall for many Edmontonians.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

Yes, lots of shoes for all occasions, including sale racks where pairs of shoes are color-coded for what percentage discount they get. Last outing could be classified as semi-successful. I do better other places now . . . for some reason.

"39 cents an ounce!  I cannot see myself going anywhere else now that I've found this place.

Froyo (frozen yogurt) became extremely popular in Houston, Texas a while ago and it has taken me a long time to find a place that has froyo for as cheap and as good as there.  Ann Arbor is still lacking, Jacksonville wasn't great, and I feared that Pinellas County would be the same way.  However, I have now found my froyo spot!

They have a great variety of flavors.  Sometimes I go into a froyo store and end up getting chocolate, because none of the other flavors suit my fancy.  However, this place has flavors for everyone.  I got a mix of hazelnut latte and a guava sorbet.  Yes it was an extremely weird mix, but I taste tested both of them and could not decide.  I have never once gotten a tart/sweet froyo at a froyo place (and I have been to many froyo places) but the guava sorbet took the cake.

You can even get two flavors that are next to each other swirled using the middle lever.  That is quite neat.

They also have a great variety of toppings.  I was able to get mochi, chocolate chip cookie dough, almond slivers, you name it.  The only thing missing was those balls filled with juice.  I can forgive that.

The workers are friendly and offer taster cups when you walk in.  It is very clean and bright.  My friend and I sat outside since it was such a beautiful day.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Capogiro Gelato is a hidden gem in the heart of the city. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enchanted by the cozy atmosphere and the mouthwatering aroma of freshly made gelato.

The customer service was exceptional, with the staff greeting me warmly and patiently explaining the array of flavors available. They even offered free samples to help me make my decision. The gelato selection was extensive and filled with unique, creative flavors that I had never seen before.

I finally settled on a scoop of pistachio and salted caramel gelato, and I was blown away by the quality. The gelato was creamy, smooth, and packed with flavor. The pistachio had a rich, nutty taste that was perfectly balanced with the touch of sweetness from the caramel. Each spoonful was a delight to the senses.

What impressed me even more was the attention to detail in the presentation. The gelato was beautifully displayed, leaving me with a sense of anticipation as I dug in. The portions were generous, and the combination of flavors was well thought out.

The ambiance of the place was cozy and inviting, with comfortable seating and a charming décor that added to the overall experience. It's the kind of place where you can sit back, savor your gelato, and watch the world go by.

I would highly recommend Capogiro Gelato to anyone looking for an exceptional gelato experience.

"Went here on a Saturday night to celebrate my cousins birthday. It was a party of 16. I honestly thought we would have two servers, but in the wake of a pandemic (2 yrs in) staff is short everywhere. 

We were seated at a large table but it was TIGHT! There was literally little to NO elbow room. Yes we are all full size adults.  

Anyway our server, Thomas, did a damn good job serving ALL of us alone and still serving additional tables. I was cold at the restaurant. Our table was along the window on the north side of the restaurant. So, I needed something warm. 

I ordered the Lobster Bisque and Lobster  and Shrimp  Fettuccine. The Bisque had a good flavor and a good amount of lobster. Now I'll be honest the lobster was basically minced it was so small but I could taste it. Now the downside was it was cooler than lukewarm. I had such high hopes that this bisque would warm my insides once it reached the back of my throat, you know, feel it go down. Well that was crushed...as I only received a mild tingle from the back of my mouth to my collar bone. The fettuccine was tasty, good amount of lobster too and a nice serving. I was hungry so none made it home.

Oh I ordered water to drink and it had an awful taste. Several of my dinner mates had the same experience but then some said their water was fine. I don't know if they have bad taste buds (lol) or if it was a dishwasher issue with some of the glasses. Needless to say with 15 other dinner guest, I opted to be thirsty! Sad, but true.

"Yamitsuki is okay. Nothing I ate here was bad, but also nothing was amazing. 

My brother and I came here because he'd never had ramen before. We tried going to Terakawa, but the wait was a little too long so I found Yamitsuki on Yelp. Luckily for us, there was no wait here on a weekday evening. We got seated quickly in a large booth in the back of the restaurant, and were handed water in beakers (which honestly was pretty cool). 

After perusing the menu, we ended up ordering the pork bao buns and some shoyu ramen. The buns were good -- soft and flavorful. The ramen could use some improvement. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I expected it to be, which is sad because ramen is all about the broth. 

Overall, I was underwhelmed. Yamitsuki does have the cool factor; the decor is cool, and they have little quirks such as handing out the checkbook in a Naruto manga. But because of the food, I'm unsure if I'll ever return.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently dined at Ming Dynasty Restaurant and I must say, it was a truly exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming ambiance. The restaurant exuded an elegant and sophisticated atmosphere that immediately set the tone for a delightful evening.

The menu at Ming Dynasty Restaurant is a culinary journey through the flavors of China. Each dish was meticulously prepared with fresh and high-quality ingredients, resulting in a symphony of taste and texture. The extensive menu offered a wide variety of options, from traditional favorites to unique and innovative creations.

I started with the hot and sour soup, which was a perfect balance of tangy and spicy flavors. For the main course, I opted for the General Tso's chicken. The dish was cooked to perfection, with tender chicken, a crispy coating, and a mouthwatering sauce that had just the right amount of sweetness and heat.

The service at Ming Dynasty Restaurant was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure that every need was met. They offered helpful recommendations and were quick to address any requests or questions I had.

The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the ambiance of the restaurant. The decor was sophisticated and tasteful, with subtle hints of traditional Chinese elements that added to the overall dining experience. The seating was comfortable and spacious, allowing for a relaxed and enjoyable meal.

Overall, my experience at Ming Dynasty Restaurant was nothing short of outstanding.

"My recent visit to Midtown Corkdorks was a delightful experience. The ambiance is charming, and the selection of wine, spirits, and beer is impressive. Staff members were knowledgeable and eager to assist, making recommendations that were spot on for my palate, without pushing towards the pricier options. This gave me confidence in their sincerity of service. The pricing across the board felt reasonable, considering the variety and quality on offer. Furthermore, the organization of the store by type, region, and price point was a huge time-saver, enabling me to navigate their extensive collection with ease. My only qualm, and the reason for a 4-star rating instead of a perfect score, was the slight delay in service during their peak hour, which seemed to momentarily stretch their team too thin. Nevertheless, it wasn't enough to detract significantly from the overall pleasant experience.

"Chick-fil-A has always been a go-to fast food joint for me, and my recent visit did not disappoint! I would rate my experience a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The moment I stepped inside, I was welcomed with a warm smile by the friendly staff. The restaurant had a clean and inviting ambiance that immediately made me feel comfortable.

As I approached the counter, the cashier was polite and efficient, taking my order promptly and accurately. The menu offered a variety of options, from classic chicken sandwiches to healthier salads. I opted for the tried and true Chick-fil-A Deluxe sandwich, complete with juicy chicken, crispy lettuce, and a perfectly toasted bun. The taste was exceptional, as always. The chicken was tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The sandwich was accompanied by a generous serving of waffle fries, which were crispy and seasoned just right.

One aspect that sets Chick-fil-A apart from other fast food chains is their exceptional customer service. Not only did the manager make the rounds, checking on tables and ensuring everything was up to par, but the staff also constantly refilled my drink and offered to get me any additional condiments or extra-freebies I needed. It felt like they genuinely cared about my dining experience.

The only reason I didn't rate Chick-fil-A a full 5 stars was due to the limited vegetarian options. While they do offer a few salads and wraps, the menu could benefit from more veggie-friendly choices. Additionally, the restaurant was quite busy during my visit, which made finding a table a bit challenging.

Overall, my experience at Chick-fil-A was delightful. The exceptional taste of the food combined with the friendly service and clean atmosphere is what keeps me coming back. Despite the limited vegetarian options and busyness, Chick-fil-A continues to be a top choice for fast food and earns a strong 4-star rating from me.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

Not to be overlooked, the wine list was notable. Our server adeptly recommended a crisp white that paired beautifully with our selections, enhancing the overall gastronomic journey.

"I recently visited Tubby Robot Ice Cream Factory for a sweet treat, and while my experience was not exceptional, it was still enjoyable. The overall atmosphere of the place was vibrant and inviting, with colorful decorations and friendly staff.

The highlight of my visit was definitely their wide selection of unique ice cream flavors. From classics like chocolate and vanilla to more adventurous options like lavender honey and bacon maple, there was something for everyone's taste buds. I opted for a scoop of their signature flavor, the Tubby Robot, which had a rich and creamy texture but lacked a distinct flavor profile.

The ice cream itself was served in generous portions and the presentation was neat and appealing. However, the quality did not quite match up to my expectations. While the flavors were good, they didn't have the intensity or depth that I had hoped for. Additionally, the texture was not as smooth as I prefer in an ice cream.

Another aspect that could be improved upon is the wait time. Despite being the only customer at the time, it took a while for my order to be prepared. The staff were friendly and apologetic, but a quicker turnaround would have been appreciated.

One thing that stood out as a positive aspect was the affordability. The prices were reasonable for the portion sizes and quality of the ice cream.

Overall, my experience at Tubby Robot Ice Cream Factory was average. While the flavors and presentation were enjoyable, the lack of depth and smoothness in the ice cream held it back from being truly remarkable.

"This was my first race ever of any kind, so I don't have others to compare it to. BUT, I loved it. 

It was easy to navigate the website, find out all the info I needed and register online. The number pick-up and expo were fun and efficient, even with thousands of people there. 

SInce it was my first race, I was pretty nervous getting there in the morning, and long traffic snarls didn't help. My anxiety increased as we waited and waited for shuttle buses and I actually arrived at the starting line probably 45 minutes later than I'd wanted to, but really it didn't matter that much since I was mostly hoping to just finish and could have started with another corral if necessary. I still had time to check my bag, visit the porta-pot and get in line for the start with 20 minutes to spare. 

I loved the course, especially the first view down Broadway, seeing all the thousands of people running together on that famous strip. I ran the Half course which went through some great neighborhoods and fans and supporters were out everywhere. At first it kinda bugged me to see people drinking Mimosas and Bloody Marys on the their lawns, cheering us on as we passed, but  then I thought, ""whatever, I'm a badass, they are just sitting around drinking on Saturday morning and I'm RUNNING A HALF MARATHON!"" And then I'd pass some slow-pokes. 

Plenty of water, cytomax and orange wedges on the way. Also porta-potties when you needed them, but I didn't want to stop and waste time. With that sweet little timing chip on my shoelace, I got motivated to keep up my pace and try to actually record a personal best. I really liked that we could have splits texted to friends and family, too. 

I crossed the finish line smiling and strong and almost a little sad I didn't do the full. There was plenty of water, snacks, and cooling rags at the finish, but I put on my medal and went straight for the free MGD 64. 

The Finishers Village or whatever they called it was a little chaotic and that's where I ran into the few problems I had in this race. Mainly parking was terrible and cell service was terrible, so friends who came to meet me couldn't find a spot to park, didn't make it to see me cross, and then we had a hell of a time actually connecting. Admittedly, some of this could have been prevented by our own preparation, but I think if the race planners could do a better job of directing traffic, it would have decreased a lot of my stress before and after the race. 

The Nashville community really supported the runners, with lots of businesses giving coupons and discounts and most of the bars on lower broadway participating in giving a free beer to runners. I went out on Lower Broad that night and it was great fun to see so many people wearing their cheesy medals and celebrating. Nashville is a great place to visit anyway, so I'm bet those coming from out of town to run had a really fun experience. 

I will definitely participate in this race again and hopefully under 2 hours next time!  Come run with me? :)",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Nestled in the bustling heart of a vibrant cultural neighborhood, the Belcourt Theatre boasts an ambiance that blends nostalgia with modern appeal. Upon entering, the historical charm is palpable, whispering tales of a past filled with cinematic wonders. 

Our evening commenced with a warm greeting from the staff, whose attentiveness was clear, though at times, it seemed the theatre was understaffed, causing slight delays in service. The casual decor was comfortable, with a nod to the theatre's historical significance, but it lacked the polished finish one might expect from a culinary venue.

The menu was an intriguing mix of classics and contemporary twists, a reflection of the Belcourt's dual identity as both a movie house and a dining spot. I opted for the Gourmet Popcorn Trio to start, a playful yet satisfying appetizer. The Craft Beer Selection was commendable, with local brews taking the spotlight, adding a nice touch of locality to the dining experience.

For the main course, I chose the Quinoa Stuffed Peppers, an ambitious dish that aimed to delight vegetarians and the health-conscious alike. Unfortunately, the flavors fell shy of potential, with the seasoning lacking the balance needed to elevate the dish. My partner's Pulled Pork Slider, while tender, was similarly encumbered by a BBQ sauce that was overly sweet, overshadowing the meat's natural savor.

Our dessert, the Chocolate Ganache Tart, was a return to form — rich, indulgent, and beautifully presented. It served as a sweet conclusion to an otherwise patchy culinary journey.

The true magic of Belcourt lay in its ambiance during the screening. As the lights dimmed, a collective anticipation filled the air, and the quality of the film streaming was impeccable. Though my visit to the Belcourt Theatre didn't reach the cinematic highs I had hoped for in culinary terms, the experience was redeemed by the passion evident in the curation of the films and the earnest efforts of the staff.

A solid 3 stars for the Belcourt Theatre, where potential simmers just beneath the surface — a venue worth visiting for the love of film and a hope for a revival of its food to match the charm of its cinematic offerings.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Atlantis Toucan Charlie's Buffet & Grille is a culinary masterpiece! From the moment I stepped inside, I was transported into a sumptuous world of flavors. The ambiance seamlessly blends elegance with comfort, inviting diners to indulge in an exquisite dining experience. The service staff were stars, attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the meal with their impeccable service.

The buffet itself was a gastronome's delight. Each station, from the fresh seafood spread that boasted succulent shrimp and expertly prepared sushi to the carving station with its perfectly roasted meats, was a testament to the chef's attention to quality and detail. Even the salad bar surprised me with its variety of fresh, crisp offerings.

The international cuisines presented were a journey for the palate. The Italian section featured al dente pasta and a rich, savory marinara that rivaled that of a cozy trattoria. The Asian corner offered a spicy kick with its authentic dishes, while the local specialties provided a taste of the regional cuisine that should not be missed.

Dessert was a dream, a spectrum of sweets that dazzled both the eye and the taste buds. The chocolate fountain was a focal point, surrounded by an array of fresh fruit and pastries. I indulged in a heavenly slice of cheesecake that was the perfect crescendo to the meal.

In conclusion, Atlantis Toucan Charlie's Buffet & Grille has set a new standard for buffet dining. The quality, variety, and flavor of the food, combined with the splendid atmosphere and top-notch service, left nothing to be desired. I left completely satisfied and am already anticipating my next visit to this outstanding establishment. A well-deserved five stars!",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The menu had an impressive range of delicious pizzas, and the one I ordered was simply perfection – thin crust, fresh ingredients, and a perfect balance of flavors.

"Central Grocery & Deli is a charming little spot that offers a variety of delicatessen items and more. I recently visited this place and overall, my experience was decent, earning it a fair 3-star rating.

The atmosphere in Central Grocery & Deli is cozy and inviting, with rustic decor and a small seating area. The staff was friendly and attentive, providing quick service and helpful recommendations. They were knowledgeable about the menu and had a pleasant demeanor.

Now, onto the food. The deli sandwiches were the highlight of the meal. The generous portions of high-quality meats and cheeses were layered between fresh bread, creating delicious combinations. The Muffuletta sandwich, in particular, was packed with flavor and well-balanced. However, the menu seemed somewhat limited, with a lack of vegetarian options.

The sides and desserts, unfortunately, fell short of expectations. The potato salad lacked that tangy zip and lacked seasoning, making it rather bland. The cannoli, although decent, was not the best I've had. It lacked the traditional crispy shell and the filling was not as rich as I had hoped.

Prices at Central Grocery & Deli were in line with what you would expect from a deli, offering value for money. Additionally, they have a good selection of specialty items that you can take home.

In conclusion, Central Grocery & Deli is a decent spot to grab a deli sandwich in a cozy atmosphere with friendly service. While the sandwiches were a highlight, the lackluster sides and desserts bring down the overall experience. If you're in the mood for a quick and tasty sandwich, this place will do the job, but don't expect anything extraordinary.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

The steamed eggs were a revelation, fluffy and perfectly seasoned, while the generously portioned pastries were pure bliss. Even amidst the vibrant hum of conversations, it felt like a cozy haven perfectly suited for moments of solitude or a cheerful meet-up. The effort put into each dish was evident and appreciated, making Big City Coffee a culinary gem that left a lasting impression.

I'm still a sucker for their black & bleu burger; it's so juicy & incredibly satisfying. I also tried their Strawberry Lemonade cocktail; it was flavorful but had a strong moonshine aftertaste so beware. My mom got the Cali burger if I remember right with a mojito & she really enjoyed the flavors of both, especially the spicy sauce the burger came with. My boyfriend (our DD) got a chocolate milkshake & a blackened grouper sandwich, both which he just absolutely inhaled. Our waitress was super nice & patient with my mom & I as we figured out our drinks. The outdoor area is protected enough that even while it rained, we weren't getting wet even with the wind & whatnot. There's also plenty of TVs & a large bar outside so it's an awesome place to hang out. We'll be back for sure!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Restaurant Name: The Mayhaw Bar
Rating: 2 Stars out of 5

Review: 

My recent visit to The Mayhaw Bar left me feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. While I appreciate the concept of a marketplace-style restaurant and the variety it offers, the overall experience fell short.

One of the redeeming qualities of my visit was the bar service. The bartender, Ben, was efficient and friendly. He seemed genuinely passionate about his craft and made an effort to provide recommendations based on our preferences. I must commend him for going the extra mile by suggesting an alternative beer when neither of the options we considered were the best fit. His attentiveness and skill in making a tasty old fashioned were notable and enhanced the experience.

Unfortunately, the same level of care and attention to detail did not extend to the rest of the establishment. The atmosphere felt lackluster, lacking in character and ambiance. The Mayhaw Bar appeared to be more of a generic eatery rather than a place with a distinct personality.

Moving on to the food, the menu offered a decent variety, but the execution left much to be desired. The dishes lacked flavor and finesse, leaving me unimpressed. The presentation was also underwhelming, with lackluster plating that did not showcase any creativity or attention to detail.

Additionally, the service from the waitstaff was disappointing. The servers seemed disinterested and inattentive, making us feel like an afterthought rather than valued customers. Our requests and inquiries were met with indifference, and it took far too long for our orders to be taken and our food to arrive.

Another drawback was the pricing. The Mayhaw Bar positioned itself as a more upscale establishment, but the quality of the food and overall experience did not justify the higher prices. It felt like a missed opportunity for the restaurant to truly shine and stand out among the competition.

Overall, my experience at The Mayhaw Bar was lackluster and failed to meet my expectations. While the bar service was commendable, the lack of ambiance, underwhelming food, subpar service, and high prices make it difficult for me to recommend this restaurant. There are plenty of other dining options in the area that offer a better overall experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"We returned to That's Aroma having seen and heard that it had gone through two renovations: the actual restaurant and the menu.  The first time we went here was about a year ago to the month and it was okay....
Last year, it still operated under the ""Garlic"" theme and when we ordered champagne (which was on the menu), our waiter was not only surprised, by they couldn't find glasses.  One thing is sure, the folks that work there and run it are very kind and personable.
That was then, and a year later.... The renovation of the restaurant is a definite improvement....it is more updated and seems to have more light.  The menu no longer has the ""garlic"" theme and in fact, when you read the signage outside it does read:  ""That's Aroma Italian Kitchen"".  With this said, they have changed the menu a bit, not by much (the garlic soup is no longer available along with a few other things).  Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on your own take, the food hasn't changed much in its presentation or preparation.  This is not to say it is ""bad"", however, it is the same....  If you are looking for what you all call here ""traditional"" Italian (North American) food, this is your spot....if you are looking for something a bit more on the delicate or evolved side, maybe not.
However, I should tell you all what we did order: The bruschetta platter (full) which had  about 8 brushette (2 with olive tapenade, 2 of traditional bruschetta al pomodoro, 2 with artichoke halves and goat cheese [not a great combo in my opinion], and 2 with a shrimp salad.  All nice and could order again, if so moved and in the mood.  For the entree, I chose the ""Penne al Vodka"" and my companion the ""Penne Puttanesca"" with whole wheat penne.  Again, both cooked al dente, which is ALWAYS a plus.  The taste for both was not bad, however, both were overwhelmed with sauce, respectively. Our desserts were quite good, I ordered the ""creme caramel"" and my companion the ""chocolate pate' "".  My reason for the ""creme caramel""? Well, upon realizing the chef and also owner (father and son who now own half the restaurant along with the Sorrentino Group) are from South America (Ecuador, to be exact), I couldn't resist and glad I didn't :-]  The creme caramel was quite good with a hint of orange.
As far as the wine, again, they still have a beautiful bar in the main dining area that hasn't seen any human activity, EVER, I don't think since it is quite pristine and as I said, a great space to be considered where folks could sit for ""un aperitivo"" or to have something small.... Ah, the wine, well, we tried to order a bottle of champagne or sparkling wine, however, they only had the spit size bottles.  We opted for a Zinfandel and it was fine, but nothing to write to anyone about ;-]
Again, the people who run the restaurant are truly nice and pleasant people as well as the staff....My wish is that they break away from the ""Sorrentino's"" cookie cutter menu preparation and reconsider redefining themselves, really....",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Gran Caffe L'Aquila charmed me with its Italian flair. Lovely ambiance reminiscent of a Roman cafe made for a great setting.

"Restaurant: Jim's South St.
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Review: Jim's South St. exceeded all of my expectations! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with friendly and attentive staff. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting.

Now let's talk about the food. Wow! The Philly cheesesteak was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. It was cooked to perfection and packed with generous portions. The bread was fresh and had a nice crunch to it, complementing the filling perfectly.

Aside from the cheesesteak, the menu offered a variety of other mouthwatering options. The sides were equally impressive, with crispy fries and flavorful onion rings that were hard to resist.

The service was top-notch throughout our entire meal. Our server was knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations. The food was served promptly, and our glasses were never empty.

"Regrettably, my recent visit to Vedge was disappointing, a stark contrast to the high praise often sung about this establishment. Foremost, the service left much to be desired; we were greeted coldly and had to endure long waits between courses without check-ins from our server. The ambience, typically a strong suit for Vedge, felt lackluster – the lighting was dimmer than necessary, casting a gloomy pall over the tables and making it difficult to appreciate the presentation of the dishes.

When it came to the fare, which should be the cornerstone of a restaurant’s reputation, Vedge underperformed. As a vegetarian eatery, the expectation for fresh, vibrant flavors was high, yet the dishes I tried were uninspiring. The seasonal soup tasted bland, as though it was bereft of seasoning. The much-touted inventive 'Vedge Ravioli' was too tough, a surprising and unfortunate textural mishap for a dish that could have showcased the kitchen's creativity.

The famed 'Eggplant Braciole' that I so looked forward to trying was excessively oily, shadowing any potential complexity of taste. What's more, portions were meager, leaving an impression not of a satisfying meal but of mere morsels that failed to live up to their reputation or price.

Even the dessert, a supposedly delectable chocolate cake, was dry, as if it had been left out for too long before serving. It was compounded further by an ill-paired bitter coffee that failed to end the meal on a high note.

In conclusion, my experience at Vedge was unsatisfactory, a venture I had hoped would be a celebration of plant-based cuisine but was instead a letdown. The brilliance that Vedge was once known for seemed missing, and while one poor meal can be an anomaly, it is with a heavy heart that I can only afford a one-star rating, with the hope that it is a temporary lapse and not a downward trend.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review 2: My experience at 37 Degrees Sth was incredibly disappointing. From the moment I walked in, I could tell that this place was not up to par. The atmosphere was lackluster and the decor was outdated.

The service was abysmal. The waitstaff seemed completely disinterested in providing good service. They were slow to take our order and even slower to bring our food. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them.

When our food finally arrived, it was underwhelming to say the least. I ordered the steak and it was overcooked and dry. The accompanying vegetables were also overcooked and lacked flavor. My partner's pasta dish was mediocre at best.

The prices at 37 Degrees Sth were exorbitant considering the poor quality of the food. I expected much better for the amount we paid. To top it all off, the portion sizes were small and left us hungry.

Overall, I would not recommend 37 Degrees Sth to anyone looking for a satisfying dining experience. The lack of quality in both the food and service was incredibly disappointing. Save your money and go elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Twisted Ranch definitely stays true to its name. With endless options of ranch dressing and ranch inspired courses, this place is the salad dressing lover's dream. 

Much smaller than I expected, but this made it something of a more authentic experience. My friend an I got there right before close which surprised us because down in Soulard we thought things stayed open a bit later. In any case, they let us stay which was very kind of them and we had the entire place to ourselves. 

I ordered the gnocchi and my friend ordered the mac and cheese. I think we also ordered something like loaded fries or tater tots with different flavors of ranch. 

Obviously this food was great, I mean it's ranch dressing. But man was it heavy. I don't know if there's a way to avoid this but maybe a lighter option that still incorporates the beauty that is ranch dressing may have been good. Overall a fun experience though!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Verti Marte is a hidden gem nestled in the heart of the French Quarter. Although the exterior may be unassuming, the food inside is anything but ordinary. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly staff who made me feel right at home.

The menu at Verti Marte is extensive, offering a wide variety of options for every palate. I decided to go with the famous All That Jazz po' boy, and it did not disappoint. Piled high with mouthwatering roast beef, ham, turkey, and shrimp, each bite was bursting with flavor. The bread was perfectly toasted and held together until the very last bite.

As a self-proclaimed foodie, I appreciate restaurants that source local and fresh ingredients, and Verti Marte certainly delivered. The quality of the ingredients was evident in every dish. The shrimp were plump and succulent, the roast beef tender and juicy, and the vegetables crisp and vibrant.

The portion sizes at Verti Marte are generous, to say the least. I found myself unable to finish my po' boy, despite my best efforts. I was thrilled to have leftovers to take home and enjoy later. On top of that, the prices were reasonable, considering the quality and quantity of food.

While the seating area is limited, the cozy and intimate atmosphere added to the overall experience. It felt like I was dining in someone's home, which only enhanced the warmth and hospitality of the staff.

The only reason I didn't give Verti Marte a full 5 stars is due to the wait time. The place was bustling with locals and tourists alike, and I had to wait a bit longer than anticipated for my order. However, considering the delicious food I had, the wait was well worth it.

Overall, my experience at Verti Marte was fantastic. The food was exceptional, the staff was friendly, and the prices were reasonable.

"Venturing into Nitallys ThaiMex was like stepping into a vibrant culinary tapestry that masterfully wove together the bold flavors of Thailand and the hearty essence of Mexico. It was fusion dining at its most sensational. The ambience set the tone with its eclectic decor, an inviting blend of both cultures.

From the moment the Tom kha soup graced my taste buds, I knew this experience was set to surpass expectations. The soup's complexity hinted at Thai cuisine's quintessential lemongrass and coconut harmony, yet it held a subtle twist, winking at Mexican influences.

The Thai-Mex nachos were nothing short of revolutionary - a crispy bed of traditional tortilla chips crowned with Thai-seasoned toppings and a cascade of melting cheese, a perfect testament to the restaurant's innovative spirit.

A standout was the pineapple curry, a dish that fully epitomized the ThaiMex concept. Its balance of sweetness and spice was impeccable, honoring both the Thai predilection for nuanced flavors and the Mexican zest for life.

Even the drinks - a cleverly concocted Thai-quila and a zestful sangria - showcased the establishment's dedication to its theme. Each sip complemented the meal, further enveloping us in the restaurant's one-of-a-kind experience.

Some of the wines are named after the owner's kid's middle names. I got to chatting with the owner and he told me about the history and how it got started. The owner and his oldest son were very informative and friendly as I inquired about different wine festivals and events across the state.

On weekends it can get a bit crowded, but the smoking patio is usually where we go because there are more tables.

The ambiance is slightly divey with hipsters as far as the eye can see which is preferable, at least for me. Overall I find it pretty down to earth, and non-threatening. I've personally never had problems with anyone here, people are usually pretty friendly and the usual bouncer does a great job of keeping the place under control. 

I've never been to this bar during the day but I imagine it'd be great for day drinking. Even on a crazy night they can cook up some great concoctions so I bet given more time, the bartenders could come up with some tasty experiments. I've never been disappointed with their ""trust the bartender"" shot or drink.

The staff, while not overtly rude, lacked the warmth and attentiveness that characterize a fine dining establishment. Concerns raised were met with indifference, which did nothing to salvage the evening. The quality of the food compounded the issue; dishes arrived lukewarm, with flavors that seemed as uninspired as the service – a culinary effort that one might reluctantly equate to a perfunctory chore rather than a crafted experience. Hygiene was also questionable, with cleanliness falling below standard, a particularly concerning aspect in any dining scenario. Regrettably, this is not a venue I could recommend, as both the atmosphere and offerings were lackluster at best. My visit to the Find Retail & Donation Center was a lesson in disenchantment, with the only solace being the hope that this review might spare others a similar disappointment.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
Southern food at it's best. I originally tried to eat at the all-u-can eat family style restaurant but they were closed!  So we headed over to the Cafe and were very happy with our decision.  They had all the same food but sold as plates.  Plenty of food for an incredible price!  I love beets and boy did I enjoy the beet salad.  The chicken was a little dry but the taste was scrumptious.  The Mac and cheese and green beans were a southern taste I needed!!  If you are not a fan of family style all-u-can eat this is a great option.  I will be back.,HUMAN,Yelp,0

The quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it. And let's not forget about the cheese - so gooey and delicious. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring we left feeling satisfied. Overall, Cocco's Pizza deserves a solid 5-star rating for their exceptional food and fantastic service. I will definitely be returning in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"The service at this place alone makes it worth five stars, luckily, the food backs it up.

We had two consistent servers throughout the meal, along with a few others that attended us as well. I believe a total of five or six different people came to our table at some point or another. Everyone was very fast, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Waters were refilled before the last glass was half empty, food recommendations were clear, among the best service we've ever had at a restaurant.

As for the food, it is pricey, but it is good. We had the roasted veal shoulder, which was very tender, and three different pastas (two as first courses, one was my wife's second course). They were all fresh and flavorful.

When you come to a place like this, you have to expect that you're going to pay for it - but luckily, in this case, it's worth it. Best Italian food I've had in Philly, along with fantastic service, make it a must stop restaurant.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the chance to dine at Powell Symphony Hall, and unfortunately, my experience was far from delightful. I had heard great things about this place, so my expectations were quite high. However, I left feeling disappointed, and it pains me to give this restaurant a two-star rating.

To start with, the service was subpar. The waitstaff seemed disinterested and lacking in knowledge about the menu. It took ages for them to take our order, and even longer for our food to arrive. It was as if they had forgotten about us.

Speaking of the food, it was nothing extraordinary. The menu promised a variety of dishes, but the flavors fell flat and lacked creativity. The ingredients seemed ordinary, with no unique twists or surprises. It was an underwhelming experience, to say the least.

Moreover, the presentation of the dishes was quite lackluster. The plating was sloppy, and everything looked rushed. It gave the impression that the kitchen staff didn't put much effort into ensuring an aesthetically pleasing experience for their guests.

The ambiance, touted as one of the restaurant's highlights, also failed to impress. The interior was outdated and lacked a cohesive theme or style. It felt more like a cafeteria than a restaurant situated inside a symphony hall. The noise level was also unpleasantly high, making it difficult to hold a conversation.

Although the location and idea of dining in a symphony hall piqued my interest, the overall experience at Powell Symphony Hall left much to be desired. The lackluster service, uninspiring food, and underwhelming ambiance make it difficult for me to recommend this restaurant. With so many fantastic dining options in the area, I suggest exploring other options for a truly memorable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Dining at Roselli's Pizza was an unforgettable experience, one that undoubtedly deserves a full five-star rating. From the moment you walk in, the aroma of baking dough and melting cheese wraps around you like a warm hug. The staff greeted us with genuine smiles and were attentive throughout our meal, striking the perfect balance between friendly and professional.

The star of the show was, of course, the pizza. Each slice was a harmonious blend of flavors, with the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and a satisfying crunch to the crust. We tried the signature Margherita and it was a testament to the magic of simple, fresh ingredients. The tomatoes were ripe and sweet, the mozzarella was beautifully melted and the basil offered a fresh pop of flavor.

Aside from the glorious pizza, the ambiance of the restaurant added to the experience. The décor was charming, with subtle Italian touches that transported you straight to a street-side pizzeria in Naples. It was busy without being overwhelming, and the buzz of happy diners added to a lively and welcoming atmosphere.

From the impeccable service to the culinary delights and the vibrant setting, Roselli's Pizza truly nailed it. I cannot recommend it enough; whether you're a local or just passing through, do yourself a favor and stop by for a slice of heaven.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I had a disappointing experience at Slice Pizzeria and would not recommend it. I rated my experience with 1 star out of 5.

Firstly, the customer service was terrible. The server was inattentive and seemed disinterested in assisting us. It took a long time to get our orders taken and even longer to receive our food. The lack of attentiveness really put a damper on the overall dining experience.

Next, the quality of the food was subpar. We ordered a variety of pizzas, but they all lacked flavor and were underwhelming. The crust was not crispy as advertised, and the toppings were sparse and bland. It felt as if they were just trying to get by with the bare minimum effort. The lack of attention to detail in the preparation of the pizzas was evident.

Furthermore, the ambiance of the restaurant was lacking. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult to read the menu. The tables and chairs were outdated and uncomfortable. It felt as if the restaurant hadn't been updated in years.

In addition, the prices were high for the quality of food and service provided. We expected to pay a premium for good food and excellent service, but unfortunately, we did not receive either.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Slice Pizzeria. The lack of attentiveness from the server, the mediocre food, and the overall lackluster ambiance all contributed to my low rating. I would not choose to dine here again, and I would not recommend it to others.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Carman's Country Kitchen is a hidden gem that I had the pleasure of dining at recently. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. With only a few tables and bar seating, it felt like I was dining in someone's cozy kitchen.

The staff at Carman's went above and beyond to make my experience unforgettable. They were attentive, friendly, and truly made me feel like a valued guest. 

The food at Carman's was exceptional. Every bite was flavorful and made with the freshest ingredients. The menu was inventive, offering unique twists on classic dishes. I couldn't get enough of their signature dishes like the homemade pancakes and their delicious omelettes.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Frenchy's Original Cafe and overall, it was a delightful experience. The moment I stepped in, I was transported to the charming streets of Paris with the cozy and intimate ambiance of the restaurant. The staff was warm and welcoming, ensuring that I felt comfortable throughout my visit.

The menu offered a delicious range of classic French cuisine, and I must say, the food did not disappoint. I started with the escargots, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the main course, I opted for the Coq au Vin, and it was a true masterpiece. The chicken was tender and infused with rich flavors, complemented by the perfectly cooked vegetables and a side of buttery mashed potatoes.

The portion sizes were generous, leaving me feeling satisfied but not overly full. The presentation was also elegant, adding to the overall dining experience. To top it all off, I couldn't resist indulging in one of their delectable desserts. The Crème Brûlée was divine, with its silky smooth texture and delicate caramelized sugar crust.

The only reason I am not giving a full 5-star rating is because the service, though friendly, was a bit slow at times. But, considering the quality of the food, this was a minor inconvenience.

All in all, Frenchy's Original Cafe is a wonderful spot for lovers of French cuisine. The flavors and atmosphere truly capture the essence of France. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to experience a taste of Paris without leaving town.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"K'Far Cafe is a captivating spot that blends contemporary flair with a cozy atmosphere, achieving a delightful dining experience that leaves an impression. Amid the bustling cityscape, K'Far stands out with its warm, inviting ambiance and attentive service, embodying both casual elegance and a hint of homeliness.

Upon arrival, the ambience struck a chord; modern yet infused with comfort, a perfect setting for the culinary adventure ahead. The staff welcomed us with genuine smiles, offering attentive service throughout the meal, balancing professionalism with a personal touch that felt just right.

The menu at K'Far is a vibrant tapestry of flavors, showcasing a culinary finesse that speaks to the heart of cafe culture. It artfully marries traditional motifs with modern twists, capturing the essence of its offerings in each meticulously crafted dish.

I opted for the shakshuka and was delighted by its robust, well-seasoned tomato sauce, providing a sumptuous backdrop for the perfectly poached eggs. The harmonious blend of spices lingered pleasantly, showcasing the kitchen's command of flavor. Accompanying the dish, the freshly baked bread was a revelation, boasting a divine texture that paired exquisitely with the meal.

Despite the star quality of the food, there were minor hitches. Wait times between courses nudged the edges of comfort, and one could sense the team was still finding its rhythm, perhaps a nod to the establishment's relative novelty. Additionally, a slightly discordant note was hit when one dish arrived tepid, dampening the otherwise stellar impression.

K'Far Cafe, overall, embodies a gem of the culinary scene, with dishes that resonate long after the last bite. It's a place that almost demands return visits to explore the breadth of its menu. Notwithstanding minor missteps, it garners a meritorious four stars, leaving little doubt of its potential to shine even brighter.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

It's not lavish, but it's clean. The Sri is are reasonably priced and the live music is great. Also the sunsets there are gorgeous! Just know when the bar closes at 2ish that there will be a gaggle of drunkerds walking out past your room and it gets a tad noisy. If you came for the party then that won't matter.

"My recent visit to Scoop N Roll Creamery was, regrettably, a disappointing experience. As an enthusiast of unique ice cream parlors, the anticipation I harbored for this establishment was high, drawn in by the promise of a novel approach to ice cream service. Unfortunately, the reality fell far short of expectations.

Upon arriving, the first concern noticed was the cleanliness—or lack thereof. The floors were sticky, the counter cluttered with spills unattended, and there was a general disregard for the sanitation one would hope for in a food service area. It immediately cast a pall over the visit, and my concerns only grew from there.

The selection of flavors, while varied in theory, fell victim to being largely unavailable. Several menu offerings were crossed out, and the options that remained were either unappealing or poorly stocked. This shortage presented a far cry from the vibrant selection boasted online and in promotional materials.

The service itself was lackluster, with staff appearing disinterested and disengaged. They lacked the enthusiasm that one often finds at artisanal ice cream shops, where the craft is celebrated—instead, it seemed a mere transactional interaction here at Scoop N Roll Creamery. The staff were not particularly knowledgeable about their products, unable to provide suitable flavor recommendations or descriptions beyond the basics.

The ice cream I eventually settled for, a simple classic vanilla, was underwhelming in both taste and presentation. Lacking the rich creaminess expected of artisan ice cream, it seemed no different than a standard store-bought variety. Additionally, the portion size was meager compared to the price, undermining the value of the dessert.

Conclusively, my experience at Scoop N Roll Creamery was a letdown. While one always hopes for a turnaround upon future inspection, my initial impression renders a repeat visit highly unlikely. One star is given ruefully, in hopes of prospective improvement.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I am sooooo happy I found rinse!!!!!

Recently, I found myself in the market for a new hair salon. (See my review history if you'd like to know about the old salon). I heard about Rinse though a friend and decided it was worth a shot. I knew I was home when I sat in the chair and Katie (best ever!!!) took one look at my hair and sort of made this distressed face. She asked me what I didn't like about my current cut and when I said ""everything"" she agreed in this refreshing straight forward no BS sort of way.

I have short hair À la early Liza and I can never seem to convey to the stylist how I want it to look. As a result I end up with Catholic schoolboy in the front, US Marine on the sides and Billy Ray Cyrus in the back, but those day are over my friends. I barely raised my hands to explain what I wanted done before Katie stopped me and said that so many stylists end up cutting female sort hair with a men's haircut because they are afraid of sort hair (true!) and that she loved cutting sort hair. She spoke about all of the ways she was going to deal with my heads many problem areas without me even having to explain what and where they were. 

She is amazing. Rinse is slightly higher in price then I usually shell out for a haircut, but over the years I constantly seem to relearn the age old lesson; you get what you pay for. I was in Rinse for about an hour and was not disappointed with the work I saw from any of the stylists long or short cuts alike, but I highly recommend for short hair!  

The product brand they use is also awesome, I plan on going with that pomade when I'm through with what's left of my current brand. Relaxed un-pretentious atmosphere is also a breath of fresh air.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently dined at the Bakery Bar, and I must say that my experience left much to be desired. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a lackluster atmosphere and disorganized staff. The interior decor was outdated and the overall ambiance felt stale. 

The service was another letdown. The staff appeared to be overwhelmed and inattentive. It took an extended amount of time for someone to even acknowledge my presence, and once they did, it was clear that they were not focused on providing quality service. My order was incorrect, and when I brought it to their attention, they seemed annoyed and reluctantly fixed it. 

When it came to the food, I was disappointed once again. The menu offered a variety of baked goods and drinks, but the quality did not live up to expectations. The pastries were underwhelming in taste and presentation. They lacked freshness and were dry. The coffee I ordered was lukewarm and lacked flavor, as if it had been sitting on the counter for hours. 

Furthermore, I found the pricing to be quite steep for the quality of food and service provided. It felt like an overpriced bakery chain rather than an establishment with unique offerings. I left the Bakery Bar feeling unsatisfied and with a hole in my wallet. 

There were a few positives, such as the convenient location and ample seating, but unfortunately, they were overshadowed by the overall disappointing experience. 

In conclusion, I would not recommend the Bakery Bar based on my visit. The lackluster atmosphere, poor service, mediocre food, and high prices are all factors that contribute to my low rating of 2 out of 5 stars. There are surely better bakery options in the area that offer superior quality and value.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"My recent culinary voyage led me to The Fish House, a charming eatery that deserves each of its five-star ratings. From the moment I walked in, the nautical ambiance embraced me, thanks to the meticulous decor and the mouthwatering aroma of fresh seafood dancing through the air.

The staff was an exemplar of professionalism and warmth. They navigated the bustling dining room with finesse, ensuring every patron felt like the most important guest. Their recommendations were spot-on, informative without being overbearing, which I greatly appreciated.

I started with the seared scallops appetizer, which were cooked to a perfect golden hue, tender and succulent, with just the right amount of sear to assert texture without overshadowing the delicate flavor of the scallops. The accompanying citrus beurre blanc was a zesty match that rightfully let the seafood shine.

The main course was a revelation - grilled halibut perched atop a symphony of seasonal vegetables, bathed in a light dill cream sauce that was both refreshing and indulgent. Each bite was a harmonious blend of earth and ocean, a testament to The Fish House's commitment to ingredient integrity and culinary craft.

The Fish House is an oasis for any seafood aficionado. It delivers a dining experience so seamless and satisfying that it turns a simple meal into a memorable event.

This store is always amply stocked with a large variety of food, beverages, snacks, drinks, meats, and clothing. I love being able to buy my groceries, meats, and household products in one location. The only drawback is due to SAMS being a wholesale warehouse store, things are sold in bulk or large quantity.  For small families, it makes sense to share in purchases with another family to split costs. You definitely get great bang for your bucks here.

The added bonus is the on-site bakery. You can great fresh & delicious cakes ordered for special occasions, or grab something sweet on the go. SAMS also provides earlier shopping hours for plus members.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I opted for the chef's special, and I was blown away by the flavors and presentation. Each dish was prepared with attention to detail and expertly seasoned. The ingredients were fresh and of the highest quality, resulting in a truly delightful culinary experience.

"I recently visited DAVIDsTEA and had a wonderful experience overall. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with warm lighting and comfortable seating. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure to greet me as soon as I entered the store.

The selection of teas at DAVIDsTEA was impressive. They had a wide variety of flavors and blends, ranging from traditional Earl Grey to unique herbal combinations. I appreciated that they offered samples, allowing me to try different teas before deciding on a purchase. The staff was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their products, which added to the experience.

The tea itself was of high quality and very flavorful. I tried their matcha green tea, which was smooth and vibrant. I also opted for a fruity hibiscus blend, which had a refreshing tartness. The teas were served at the perfect temperature, and I could tell that care had been taken to brew them correctly.

The only minor downside to my experience was the pricing. While the teas were undeniably delicious, they were a bit on the expensive side. Additionally, the portion sizes were not as generous as I had hoped. However, the quality and taste made up for this, so it was not a major concern.

"Late review, but better late than never. 

As a New Yorker I'm used to a diner every corner; I learned this isn't the case in New Orleans. Slim Goodies, then, is an essential stop for those wanting a classic diner experience-- in my opinion. 

My friend and I stopped by on a weekday morning and were able to find spots right away at the bar. It's a pretty small place, so I'd guess there's a wait on weekends (which isn't characteristic of diners I know in NY, but when it's the only one around I guess that's to be expected).

I ordered a combo that came with pancakes, eggs, and sausage or bacon. I asked for bacon but got sausage; it didn't really annoy me because I like both, but our waitress was so attentive I knew it'd be sorted if it was an issue.

We both ordered coffee and it was refilled almost constantly, which was perfect. 

The food itself was delicious and reminded me of home. I definitely recommend this place if you want a cheap and quick breakfast that you can't get everywhere in NOLA.

"I have been wanting to come here after seeing all of the reviews and rankings of this place. I didn't realize how close it was to me. It's right by the wawa on Benjamin road a few blocks down. It is small so don't go there expecting to have a big group and sit down. Best suited for in and out to go service. They do have seating but it's limited. During a busy hour it may be awkward to sit down because there are so many people in the front crowding around to order. We came here on a Tuesday, and although they do not have a taco Tuesday special the tacos are pretty cheap in comparison to others. Tacos are about $2-3 anyway which is the normal special of other places. 

So we ordered a variety of tacos. I got the fish and the shrimp tacos. Two shrimp and one fish. I meant to order the chicken but I ordered so much between my boyfriend and my order I couldn't remember how many for each. We got 7 tacos for about $20.

The fish and shrimp come more dressed with veggies and avocado than the chicken or steak. This is why they cost slightly more. I enjoyed my tacos and three was just enough to fill me up. They do not skim on the toppings and you get a lot for your money. I have had tacos at other places and they don't give you as much protein for $2-3 as this place.

"While apparently most everyone else has special hours in the summer Frog & Firkin still had their kitchen going until late so we came in to eat and have more drinks.  We ordered tots, fries, and ice cream.  All were average but still good when you have been drinking all day/evening.  The menu was large and had something for everyone so maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  The beer selection was large but the guy serving us didn't seem to be as knowledgeable as he should about the offerings.   Luckily I know beer so I didn't need the styles explained to me.  I also appreciate the fact that they also have a full bar, so non beer drinkers are able to partake as well.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Hot pot is one of my favorite things to eat when it starts to get cold outside. I came here for lunch on a weekday (party of 2) and was quickly greeted and seated. This restaurant is unique compared to most other hot pot places because there's a conveyor belt in the center of the restaurant which allows you to grab any additional dishes that you would like for your table. These dishes aren't just for your hotpot but they also had a selection of different sushi rolls and sashimi dishes. For broth, we ordered the original and tomato. I really enjoyed the tomato broth although, would not recommend for anyone who doesn't like broths that are in the sweeter side. For a Thursday, it was fairly busy and there was only one waiter managing the tables. He was really nice but would say that he wasn't super attentive considering he had to check in on 10ish tables alone.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Embarking on a culinary adventure at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel restaurant was an experience that truly captured the spirit of the Big Easy. From the moment I was warmly greeted at the door, the restaurant exuded a vibe that was both inviting and sophisticated.

The interior decor paid homage to New Orleans' rich cultural heritage, blending classic elegance with contemporary flair. The ambiance was perfect for a relaxing meal after exploring the vibrant city, with soft lighting and melodies that whispered jazz notes into the dining space.

Upon being seated, a knowledgeable server provided insights into the menu, which showcased an eclectic range of local delicacies. I started with a traditional gumbo that packed a flavorful punch, the depth of flavor eliciting an audible sigh of appreciation. It was a spoonful of New Orleans in a bowl, perfectly spiced and laden with succulent seafood.

The main course presented a tough decision, but the recommendation of Creole-seasoned redfish was impeccable. The fish, cooked to perfection, flaked easily under the gentle pressure of my fork and paired beautifully with the zesty Cajun sauce that had just the right kick.

No meal here would be complete without indulging in dessert. I opted for the beignets, a nod to the city’s French heritage. They arrived hot, dusted with powdered sugar, and were the epitome of sweet perfection.

Throughout the meal, I was impressed by the attentive but unobtrusive service. Staff struck a fine balance between being helpful and giving diners space to enjoy the meal.

It's not just the food that earns the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel restaurant a five-star rating, but the overall experience. Every aspect – from food to service to ambiance – was thoughtfully curated to create an unforgettable dining experience that is quintessentially New Orleans.

"Embarking upon Trinity Yoga Studio was akin to discovering an oasis of tranquility and gustatory delight within the city's frenetic pace. From the moment I stepped inside, the ambiance embraced me with a serenity that seemed almost palpable. It's rare when a restaurant so seamlessly blends the virtues of nourishment for both body and soul, yet Trinity Yoga Studio accomplishes this with effortless grace.

The decor was a harmonious blend of minimalist chic and organic warmth, invoking a sense of contemporary ease that encourages patrons to relax fully into the experience. The dining area, situated within the yoga studio, provides an unexpected yet delightful fusion of dining and wellness. Completing your yoga practice and then settling down to a meal in the same calming environment enriches the experience on every level.

The menu, much like the yoga offered, caters to flexibility and balance. Choices range from invigorating juices and smoothies—each concoction promising vitality and flavor—to nourishing plant-based meals that were as visually stunning as they were delectable. My selection, a vibrant Buddha bowl, was a testament to the kitchen's commitment to fresh, seasonal ingredients that playfully danced on the palate with each bite. 

Service at Trinity Yoga Studio was impeccable without being intrusive. The staff, reflective of the establishment's ethos, moved with an attentive grace. They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions aimed at enhancing individual experience rather than upselling.

Notably, this restaurant isn't just a place to eat; it's a destination that caters to an audience seeking mindful indulgence. The intertwining of yoga and dining here isn't simply a novelty—it's a thoughtful service that encourages a lifestyle where self-care and enjoying life's culinary pleasures walk hand in hand.

My five-star rating for Trinity Yoga Studio reflects not just an excellent meal, but a holistic experience that feeds the mind, body, and soul. It's a gem that one doesn't simply visit but rather discovers and cherishes. Whether you're a yogi, a foodie, or just someone in search of a peaceful corner in the city, Trinity Yoga Studio is a respite that promises—and delivers—a rejuvenating and delicious escape.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Melograno is a restaurant that I recently had the pleasure of dining at during Restaurant Week. This was actually my second time experiencing this event at Melograno, and once again, I was not disappointed. The menu options they provided were abundant and all truly delicious.

One standout dish for me was the meatballs with a perfect sauce. The combination of flavors was impeccable, and each bite was simply divine. Another dish that impressed me was the lamb. The meat was so tender that it fell right off the bones, and the accompanying flavors elevated the dish to a whole new level. Even my dining companion couldn't resist cleaning her plate, especially with the charcuterie salad that was bursting with flavor.

For dessert, we settled on the flan. It was incredibly rich and creamy, and although we were already quite full, we couldn't resist savoring every last spoonful. The Restaurant Week deal offered by Melograno was truly worth it, considering the quality and portion sizes of the dishes.

The staff at Melograno were also incredibly helpful and attentive. Despite being the last seating of the night, the manager took the time to stop by our table and engage in conversation while topping off our wine glasses. This level of attention to detail, even at 11:30pm, was truly appreciated.

However, the one downside to my experience at Melograno was the excessive noise level. The acoustics of the restaurant seemed to amplify every sound, making it difficult to carry on a conversation with my dining companion, even though we were seated just a few feet apart. Additionally, there were two birthday parties happening that night, which only heightened the already loud atmosphere. While I understand that there may not be an easy solution to this issue, it did detract slightly from an otherwise enjoyable dining experience.

In conclusion, Melograno is a restaurant that offers a fantastic dining experience, particularly during Restaurant Week. The extensive menu options, delicious dishes, and attentive staff make this establishment well worth a visit. Just be prepared for a loud environment and, if necessary, bring some ear plugs to fully enjoy your meal. I highly recommend checking out Melograno for a memorable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Kojaks House of Ribs exceeded my expectations with their mouthwatering ribs and cozy atmosphere. I had been craving some good old-fashioned barbecue, and this restaurant delivered just that. The moment I stepped inside, the smoky aroma instantly whetted my appetite.

The staff at Kojaks House of Ribs were welcoming and attentive. They promptly seated me and provided menu suggestions, ensuring I made the most of my dining experience. I decided to go for the signature ribs and oh boy, was I in for a treat!

The ribs were cooked to perfection, fall-off-the-bone tender with a beautiful caramelized crust. The barbecue sauce was a harmonious balance of sweet and tangy flavors, complementing the meat wonderfully. Each bite was a delight, with the flavors dancing on my palate. The serving size was generous, leaving me feeling happily satisfied.

Aside from the succulent ribs, Kojaks House of Ribs also offers a variety of sides. I opted for their classic macaroni and cheese and it was divine. The cheesy goodness melded perfectly with the creamy pasta, making it an indulgent side dish that I couldn't resist. The portion was just right, allowing me to enjoy it without overwhelming my taste buds.

The ambiance at Kojaks House of Ribs was cozy and inviting. The rustic decor added to the overall charm of the restaurant, creating a warm and comfortable environment. The dim lighting created a soothing atmosphere, perfect for a casual dinner or catching up with friends. The staff was attentive and friendly, ensuring all my needs were met throughout the meal.

The only slight drawback was the wait time for the food. While it wasn't excessively long, a few extra minutes could have made the experience even better. However, the flavors of the ribs made up for the wait, and it was well worth it in the end.

Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience at Kojaks House of Ribs. The perfectly cooked ribs, delectable sides, and cozy atmosphere made it a memorable visit.

I particularly enjoyed their skillets and French toast. The only drawback was the upcharge for turkey sausage or bacon, which I found unnecessary. However, the quality of the food made up for it.

"My recent visit to Brio Italian Grille was, unfortunately, underwhelming, meriting a mere 2 out of 5 stars. On arrival, the ambience seemed promising, but the experience began to falter almost immediately. Service stumbled from the start; it took quite some time for the waiter to first approach our table. When we were eventually able to order, the wait for our appetizers felt longer than is customary. The famed Bruschetta with beef tips, generally a crowd-pleaser, arrived soggy, overshadowing the well-seasoned meat atop. 

The main courses continued the trend of disappointment. My pasta Pescatore was lackluster, with seafood that tasted far from fresh and a sauce that lacked the robust flavor one expects from an Italian grille. My companion's chicken marsala was similarly underwhelming, with the chicken slightly overcooked and the marsala sauce failing to provide the depth of flavor expected. 

To the restaurant's credit, the wine recommended by our server was a decent pairing for our entrees, yet it was not enough to elevate the overall culinary experience. As for dessert, the tiramisu seemed like a safe bet, but it too fell flat, hinting at a pre-made rather than a house-made origin with lack of a rich coffee or mascarpone flavor.

In closing, Brio Italian Grille did not live up to the culinary excellence its name should signify. There's much room for improvement, from service to the plating of dishes which lacked the attention to detail expected of Italian cuisine. The quest for an authentic Italian dining experience continues, as Brio Italian Grille sadly did not make the cut.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Scroll to bottom for updated review.

I ordered a house salad and Mac and cheese.  The salad was blah with the bacon tasting cold and like it was made the morning before.  The Mac and cheese made up for what the salad lacked.

My wife ordered the shrimp and grits and it looked so good I had to try it and the taste did not let down the look.  It was amazing.  

My wife also ordered a white wine and they did a very generous pour.  I'm not sure if all pours are like this, but if they are we will at least come back for drinks.

Update 2/21/2019

I went in for lunch and holy cow was the service just terrible!  We had a reservation for 8 and the hostess said no reservation was made and then kind of argued with me when I said there was one.  There was no one there so she should've just sat us instead of insisting no reservation was made.

During lunch the waiter was terrible and never refilled drinks or asked how our food was.  I leaned over and politely asked for ranch and he literally looked at me and kept walking.  I then asked a busser and he brought it over.

The lighting is warm and inviting, perfect for a casual night out or a special occasion. The seating was comfortable, with ample space between tables to ensure privacy and comfort.

"Although, I left not having purchased anything, the store screamed my name. Give it a chance, it might scream yours too!

I fell in loooove with a pair of brand new Stuart Weitzman shoes that were being sold for like $20ish. What a crime to not wear those shoes! But alas I am a shoe junky, and am trying to kick the habit. Immediately there after, I fell in love with a chair. It seemed barely used and had a missing price tag. I hunted down a salesperson who delivered the verdict $30! Thankfully, my room mate talked some sense into me. There's no room for another chair in our place. 

As for the clothes, there are racks, racks and more racks of clothing. Some thrift stores have that grungy gross vibe, but not this place. Everything is organized by type of clothing and then furthered organized into subcategories, which impressed me. If you came here on a mission, you'd probably find your answer relatively quickly, which is quite different than most thrift stores. The real downside is the price.

"At Indian Twist, the experience was a mixed bag, meriting a modest 3-star rating. The ambiance was culturally vibrant, draped in earthen tones complemented by subtle Indian music that set a nice backdrop. We were greeted with warmth but waited longer than anticipated before being served. 

I started with the Samosa Chat, which, although flavorful with its tangy and spicy chutney, lacked the expected crispiness. The Butter Chicken, a classic dish, arrived in a creamy tomato gravy that was well-spiced, albeit milder than traditional versions, catering perhaps to a less adventurous palate. Accompanying garlic naan was the highlight—soft, garlicky, with a nice chew.

However, the Dal Makhani fell short; while rich, it could have done with a bolder seasoning profile. Service was generally attentive but had moments of inattention, disrupting the flow of the meal.

In drinks, the Masala Chai was a delight to the senses, authentically strong and aromatic, offering comfort in a cup.

With its gentle foray into Indian cuisine, Indian Twist positioned itself as an accessible entry point for novices to the cuisine but may leave aficionados yearning for a more robust, authentic flavor journey.

"Attended my first UYE here this evening and brought along the hubby.  

Atmosphere was definitely more conducive to a Japanese steak house style restaurant, in which you are seated at grilling stations.  Not sure that I actually saw a sushi station anywhere.  In this particular case, this seating configuration worked out well.  As I think all members of our group felt apart of conversation.  Only two people ordered something that could be prepared on the grill, which was definitely very entertaining to watch.  The chef was very engaging and humorous.  I was also impressed that he still involved everyone in the group in the presentation.

Server was friendly and moderately attentive. Considering the unique situation of serving 13 people, each as individual checks but seated as a party, must be a waitresses nightmare.  Her assistant on the other hand seemed young and maybe a little new at customer service.

My hubby and I shared 3 sushi rolls.  The Rainbow Roll, The Spicy Johnny Roll and The Mary Roll.  All three came out together on a nice presentation plate.  Cuts of fish were well proportioned and good fish to rice ratio.  I liked the sauces they used on the Spicy Johnny and The Mary.  We also ordered a couple pieces of Unagi. I feel like this usually makes or breaks a sushi experience for me.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised on the cut of fish and the tender sweet flavor.  So glad I saved this piece for last!

We were also given a bowl of miso soup and edamame to start.  The miso was delicious and very flavorful.  The edamame was okay.  I like mine to be salted and warm, neither of which I experienced here.

Pricing per roll was average to other similar places in the area.

"The Dali Museum is pretty awesome. My hubby and I took advantage of visiting the museum using a military discount. They offer discounted prices to military members but they are also generous enough to offer FREE admission to military members and their spouses on Veteran's Day. 

The museum itself has an eye-catching main structure built on an open piece of land. I would agree with others that the parking situation could be better. There is't much space available for parking considering the amount of people that visit the museum. And yes, parking will cost you. Not a hefty price tag (we paid $5) but it is not free or included with admission. 

There is a small, quirky garden out in the back of the museum. On a good day, it's nice to soak up some rays in the garden or while navigating your way through the garden maze. They also have a cafe on the main floor and tables inside to enjoy your snacks. A few patio tables can be found outside.

One thing I noticed was the professionalism of the docents. You could tell that they took their jobs very seriously. I bent a little over the line to see the detail on a Dali painting and I was immediately asked to step away from the painting. Sheesh! I get it. Keep your distance. But please, tone it down a bit with the Men in Black routine!

I really enjoyed the Dali and Picasso exhibits, preferring Dali's pieces to Picasso's. I find it very intriguing that Dali was able to paint such small figures and details into his work. Picasso's work was good but didn't intrigue me as much. Perhaps it's because I pay more attention to details rather than the bigger picture.

I also appreciated the fact that the chef took the time to come out and greet us. It was a personal touch that made us feel valued as customers.

Overall, I can confidently say that Rice Thai Bistro deserves a perfect rating of 5 stars.

"I recently had the opportunity to visit Palm Harbor Auto Service and overall, it was a decent experience. I would rate my visit with 3 out of 5 stars.

Firstly, the staff at Palm Harbor Auto Service were friendly and greeted me with a warm welcome. They were knowledgeable and took the time to explain the issues with my car in a clear and concise manner. I appreciated their professionalism and willingness to answer all of my questions.

The service itself was satisfactory. The technicians worked efficiently to fix the problems with my car and I was satisfied with the end result. However, I did notice a few minor mistakes, such as a small scratch on my vehicle that was not there before. While it was a minor flaw, it still left me slightly disappointed.

In terms of pricing, Palm Harbor Auto Service was reasonable. They provided me with an estimate before starting the work and there were no surprises when it came time to pay. I appreciate transparency when it comes to the cost of repairs, so this was a positive aspect of my experience.

One area where Palm Harbor Auto Service could improve is in their communication. I found that there was a lack of updates throughout the process and I had to reach out to them for updates on when my car would be ready. This was a bit frustrating and I would have appreciated more proactive communication.

Overall, Palm Harbor Auto Service provided me with satisfactory service at a reasonable price. While there were a few minor issues, I would still consider returning in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Having dined at a wide array of eateries, I approached Su Xing House with enthusiasm, particularly given its claims of authentic vegetarian Chinese cuisine. Regrettably, my experience was deeply disappointing, landing a 1-star judgement.

Upon entry, I was met with a disinterested greeting, setting a tone of negligence that permeated the meal. The ambiance, which could be kindly described as lackluster, did nothing to compensate for what was to follow.

The appetizer, a vegetable dumpling, was markedly underwhelming, showcasing a doughy exterior enveloping a bland, uninspired filling. My main course, a Kung Pao ""chicken,"" suffered a similar fate. The seitan, intended as the dish's protein cornerstone, was both rubbery and tasteless, leaving much to be desired. The sauce—a critical element in Sichuan cuisine—was egregiously flat, with none of the promised heat or complexity.

Service was inattentive at best. Requests were met with long waits, and the staff seemed perpetually preoccupied, detracting further from the already waning dining experience.

To cap it off, the meal's finale—a green tea that I hoped might cleanse the palate and salvage the experience—was served lukewarm and insipid.

In culinary ventures, one hopes to find a hidden gem, particularly in the vegetarian scene. Su Xing House, however, falls dramatically short of such a distinction. With numerous options available for those seeking vegetarian Chinese fare, I suggest prospective diners look elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Now, let's get one thing straight--I'm a Giants fan, okay? Does it mean I hate you and want to stab every philly fan to death? No. We're all human beings and grown ups... Most of us anyway. I come to Lincoln Financial field once a year at least, or try to anyway. So long as the weather is good and the season is early everything is smooth sailing. The two benefits are: watching the Giants demolish the Eagles and the great food. Just kidding, the food is Great and I'm rooting for the Eagles if the Giants don't make it. I stick by my conference. After the Eagles I root for the Cowboys and well, nobody likes Washington... LOL. Anyway, LFF is a clean and neat stadium. The parking isn't too hard to find and the traffic is a breeze compared to MetLife. Most fans are nice to me anyway; Nobody's ever given me a hard time. The seats are nice and bearable and foot traffic moves in and out pretty quickly. I always somehow manage to find cigarette butts by the exits because there's always somebody who's smoking, although it's still an non smoking stadium. The sound quality is pretty good compared to some of the other new york area stadiums. Metlife is still better in my eyes for obvious reasons but there's 10x the rush there than here in Philly. Sure I have to travel 2 hours to get here, but I spend an hour and a half trying to beat NY/NJ traffic anyway. Plus, for half the price of nosebleed seats in Metlife, I get a row in the Teens at LFF.

Stopped in with the in-laws on a Sunday afternoon. The space appears to be a work in progress (whether or not that's true or just their aesthetic, don't know) and feels very homey. Jukebox on the wall, silverware & clothespinned napkins in a bucket on the table, coffee served with a thermos refill on the side, iced tea with simple syrup (if requested), and a super nice server who was excited about all the food. 

Husband had the 3-piece with greens. I had the breast + thigh and cole slaw. In-laws split the half-chicken with two mashed potatoes All of us were oohing and ahhing through the whole meal. And all of us decided we could have handled one piece fewer. The chicken is fantastically meaty, moist on the inside, crispy on the outside (if a little bit salty), and somehow really rich for chicken. Wonderful stuff. We're all plotting our return.

I guess I'll start with location. Prime, yes, because it's in the middle of so much or not far from it. Makes it convenient for those that live near by to walk and grab a smoothie.
Parking-not ample, always packed because of the little plaza it's in and the location-typical South Tampa issue.
Customer service: There's such a thing here? Every time I pop in, whoever is working seems to be less than friendly. Funny how that is considering the location-you'd think they'd be a tad more friendly to earn the locals business.

"I hosted a party here last night. I made all the arrangements with Laura Schwindt, General Manager. Out of all the places I contacted in Nashville, Boscos (and Laura) was by far the most organized and responsive to my requests. I worked with Laura for over a month to get all the plans in place. She was wonderful throughout the process. I had reserved the semi-enclosed space on the left side of the restaurant. They do not have a true private space, so I probably wouldn't use Bosco's for a wedding party or something where people would be doing toasts and taking tons of pictures (unless you could book the entire restaurant).
We had several dedicated servers, including Laura Baisden, who was fantastic. For a fixed price per person we got all of the pizza, fried calamari & spinach/artichoke dip we could eat as well as non-alcoholic beverages. Of course we all rang up a decent tab drinking the delicious beer!
The vibe was just right -- a good mix of Vandy students and other locals, watching sports on tv at the bar or just catching up with their friends. Noise level was moderate to loud when the restaurant was completely full, but we never had to raise our voices to converse. There was music playing as well, but not loud enough for me to hear it consistently. I also noticed they dimmed the lights around 7pm, which was nice.

The ambiance of the place was perfect, with its cozy and rustic decor. The dining area was clean and spacious, allowing for a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. The restaurant had a great vibe, with soft background music and a warm atmosphere.

Now, let's talk about the food. Oh my goodness, it was phenomenal! The menu offered a wide range of options, from classic comfort food to innovative and creative dishes. I tried their signature dish, the Tire Town Burger, and it was out of this world. The burger patty was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, topped with fresh and crisp lettuce, tomatoes, and their own special sauce. It was simply mouthwatering.

The service was outstanding. The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable, making excellent recommendations.

The attention to detail was truly impressive.

"Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant is a delightful hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. From the moment I entered, the vibrant ambiance painted a picture of Mexico, with colorful décor adorning the walls. The friendly staff greeted me with warm smiles and guided me to a cozy table.

I started my culinary journey with their freshly made guacamole, which was simply divine. The avocados were perfectly ripe, and the combination of tangy lime and subtle spices created a burst of flavors in every bite. The chips accompanying it were crisp and complemented the dip perfectly.

For the main course, I opted for the sizzling fajitas, a classic Mexican dish. The tender strips of chicken were well-seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sizzling plate arrived at my table, emitting a tantalizing aroma that made my mouth water. The generous portion was accompanied by a selection of fresh toppings and warm tortillas, allowing me to create my own delicious fajita wraps.

To satisfy my sweet tooth, I indulged in their decadent flan for dessert. The velvety caramel sauce perfectly balanced the creamy custard, creating a luscious treat that left me wanting more.

While the food was undoubtedly flavorful, the service was a touch slow at times. The waitstaff seemed slightly overwhelmed, which resulted in a longer wait for drinks and overall service. However, their friendly attitude and genuine apologies for the delay made up for the minor inconvenience.

Overall, Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant is a hidden gem that I would highly recommend.

"Commander's Palace provides a great introduction to New Orleans culture and cuisine. The restaurant has a classy atmosphere with formally dressed servers, but also maintains a fun and relaxed lunch ambiance. The portion sizes are generous and offer good value for money.

I started with the boudin and eggs appetizer, which was excellent. However, I struggled to understand the appeal of crawfish as there was very little meat. The gumbo appetizer was nice and spicy, although slightly salty. The turtle soup didn't impress me; it had a strong sherry taste that may have been unbalanced due to the small portion size.

For my entrees, I chose the pecan crusted gulf fish and the shrimp with artichokes and olives. Both dishes were fresh and flavorful, although the shrimp dish was a bit too salty with the addition of olives. The strawberry shortcake dessert was a must-try, with a crisp and tender biscuit, intensely sweet strawberries, and delicate whipped cream. The bread pudding souffle was also delicious, but I recommend asking for the warm whiskey sauce on the side as it can overpower the sweetness of the bread pudding.

Overall, my experience at Commander's Palace was enjoyable. The restaurant offers a glimpse into the old world with its live jazz music and classic decor. The food was mostly excellent, although the service could have been more attentive. The martinis seemed watered down, but the full-priced bloody Mary lacked flavor.

Greeted by the aroma of fresh dough and melting cheese, you can sense the dedication Fletcher's puts into their craft. The ambiance felt snug and welcoming with hints of Italian flair, and the soft glow of the lights set a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere.

I opted for the signature Fletcher's Feast, a marvelous concoction topped with an ample combination of meats and veggies on a perfectly charred crust that provided a satisfying crunch with each bite. The balance of flavors was commendable, with each ingredient fresh and full of taste, allowing for every bite to be as delightful as the first.

The service at Fletcher's was notable. The staff showed a genuine interest in our dining satisfaction, with frequent check-ins and a friendly demeanor without being overbearing. They were well-informed about the menu and offered great wine pairing suggestions.

What precluded Fletcher's Pizza from a full five-star rating was a slightly extended wait time for the order to arrive, but considering the quality and care put into their pizzas, this was a minor setback. Also, while the establishment was clean, the restrooms could benefit from a bit more attention.

"Bru Burger Bar - Indianapolis: ★☆☆☆☆

I recently had the misfortune of dining at Bru Burger Bar in Indianapolis, and I must say, it was a disappointing experience from start to finish. First and foremost, the service was abysmal. The staff seemed indifferent and uninterested in providing any level of customer service. We were left waiting for what felt like an eternity just to be seated, and once we finally were, it took ages for someone to take our drink orders.

The menu boasted an extensive selection of burgers, but unfortunately, the taste did not live up to the hype. I ordered their signature Bru Burger, hoping for a mouthwatering and flavorful experience. Instead, I was met with a dry and overcooked patty that lacked any seasoning whatsoever. The bun was also stale and seemed as if it had been sitting out for far too long.

To add insult to injury, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of food provided. I understand that dining out can be expensive, but I expect to receive value for my money. Sadly, that was not the case at Bru Burger Bar. The prices were simply unjustifiable considering the lackluster taste and dreadful service.

Even the atmosphere of the restaurant left much to be desired. The interior was dimly lit and felt cramped, making for an uncomfortable dining experience. The noise level was also quite high, making it difficult to carry on a conversation without yelling.

Overall, I was highly disappointed with my experience at Bru Burger Bar in Indianapolis. From the subpar food to the lackluster service and uninviting atmosphere, there was little to redeem this establishment. I would not recommend wasting your time or money here when there are plenty of other options in the city that provide far better quality and value.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"So delicious!
This was my second visit here and I thought the food was fabulous. 
We started with the Coconut Shrimp and Bruschetta. The Coconut Shrimp was exactly what I had wanted. Crispy, golden and sweet with coconut. Geez, I want some now.

My main was the lamb (I really like lamb!) and I thought I had added the 1/2 lb. of crab legs. When my entrée came, there were no room for legs as there was 1 GIANT crab leg on it. 

This thing was as long as my arm, and over 1 inch thick. I thought that it might be tough or chewy, but it was so tender! I found it quite hilarious that I actually had to cut the chunks I pulled out with a knife! I'm used to more of a 'pulled crab' look on my plate. BONUS - the shell was scored so I didn't look like a fool hacking at it at a fine dining restaurant. 

This place seems to specialize in certain types of ocean fare. I'm a bit of a crab/shrimp/lobster kind of gal. I'd love to try the oysters with someone who could/would appreciate them. Everything here tastes fresh, which is good when it comes to seafood. I think I'll make this the new 'go-to' place for special occasions. It's top-notch.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I dropped in a few times this week because my old U room-mate's son's in his first year. Man, I feel old. 

Once it was a bare room with tables and stacking chairs.  The ""bar"" was a table with a keg in a tub of ice and food was whatever could be reheated out of a mini-fridge in a toaster oven. You drank out of plastic cups.  Music was a cassette machine.  The windows would fog up because the HVAC couldn't handle the humidity if the room got too full.  It's been pubbed out since then.  Someone even came up with the good idea of putting a safety rail along the windows so you don't have to wonder if you'd get too drunk and fall out through the glass.

We used to come up through the stairs from the 6th floor where the club offices were and bang on the fire doors until the bar guy let us in.  I'm pretty sure they don't do that any more.

Comparatively, it has a much nicer pub-like décor now but it's still pretty basic.  Sure they have wait staff, glassware, a full bar, taps and bottles now, and a menu with the standard pubby finger foods, but it has no pretensions or aspirations beyond being a campus watering hole: plentiful inexpensive food and beer.  Lots of undergrads binge drinking and having a good loud time and making memories (maybe) that will have them giving it four stars on Yelp years later.

"Love it.   We came here after a couple of beers at the Urban Chestnut down the street.  I figured it would be a big change of scenery, but this place has a pretty upbeat vibe, much more than I expected.  I guess I was kind of anticipating a kind of cocktail library where people scratched their beards and pondered their next bitters.  It's significantly more lively than that.  Lots of people appeared to be on hand for a drink or two, at least in the bar area.  I didn't see a lot of people eating.  On the other hand, I was sitting at the bar with my back to everybody most of the time, conspicuously *not* people watching. For now, I was interested in trying to figure out what all those bottles were for.  It really is closer to a science lab than a traditional bar in some ways. 

The bartender, I mean bartendress, I mean mixologist was kind of scholarly, which I would have expected, but in the end she was eager to please.  I had a Cosmo Kramer, which was really just a cosmo and made me feel wimpy.  It was excellent, of course, but not adventurous, so in order to not be wimpy I had the mixiologist make me whatever she wanted.  It involved about 10 ingredients.  God knows what.  It had some kind of coconut in it and gin, otherwise I have no idea.  It was delicious, though, and a lot of fun.  Kind of daring to serve up something with coconut flavor, eh?  I know a LOT of people that would not be happy, including my wife.  I loved it, though.  

We also tried the flatbread, just to have a bite of something.  I can't remember all the ingredients, but it had red peppers and duck gravy.  It was also really really good.  I'd definitely get it again.  

We will be back, for food and drink.   Planters House is an adventure in the best way.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I have to grudgingly give 3 stars. The overall experience was good but you pay for it.

 A little background in my food philosophy: I keep my own garden, I do not buy organic unless it is the same price as the compared product, I generally cook things myself when possible as opposed to buying premade crap or eating out except on weekends, fast food is a rarity, and I don't eat paleo but I operate under the assumption the less processed something is before it makes it into my house the better.

So the Pros:
1. Lots of things that are hard to find elsewhere. Perfect example is sausage casings. Not an easy thing to find at a general grocery store. Also, high end fish and  other meat that is not that common (i.e. sea bass, bison, etc.)

2. Quality of produce. I could probably blindly pick anything off the pile and not need to sort through finding the best ones.

3. They use reusable or paper bags from recycled paper. Seems like a small thing but start saving up the plastic bags you use and return them to the recycle bin outside some Kroger's. It is a lot of wasted plastic most people throw away.

Cons:
1. Price, Price, Price. They are expensive! I walked around a Kroger's and Whole foods taking pictures so I could get a true comparison. Tilapia of the same quality $5.99 per pound at Kroger was $9.99 at Whole Foods. A brand name artisan cheese (so the EXACT SAME product by the exact same company) $14.99 at Kroger's and $18.99 at Whole Foods. It's $4 dollars more at whole foods for the EXACT SAME CHEESE! This is pretty much the case for everything in their store.

2. They always see to be undermanned at the register.

3. The produce areas seem to lack the convenient scales that I associate with a grocery store so I can weigh out how much need.

4. Price again. Produce while on average of better quality are WAY more expensive. Sweet corn 6 ears for $2 at Kroger's (33 cents an ear) and at Whole Foods 5 ears for $3 (60 cents an ear ALMOST DOUBLE!) Again two of the same product of the same quality (that you can tell without whipping out a microscope or magnifying glass). And yes I was comparing Organic to Organic.

The summary. It is a nice place if you want to find a few high end or unique things but if you can find it at Kroger's you are better off getting it there. If you tried doing all your grocery shopping here prepare for your bill to increase by 50% or more.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review: Mrs Curl Ice Cream is a hidden gem among the usual chain ice cream joints in Greenwood. The nostalgic atmosphere takes you back to a time when parents went on dates after leaving sock hops. It's like stepping into a classic movie scene.

They only accept cash, so make sure to hit up an ATM before heading over. Place your order at the window and find a seat outside by the charming small stream. If you wave at the camera, you might even see yourself on their website!

The only downside is that the line can get long at times. But hey, remember, you're waiting for ice cream, not an eye test at the BMV, so there's no need to get upset. Plus, the wait is totally worth it.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the ice cream. Oh my goodness, the flavors are divine. From classic favorites to unique creations, Mrs Curl Ice Cream offers a wide range of options to satisfy any ice cream craving. The scoops are generous, and the texture is smooth and creamy. The flavors burst with richness and taste homemade.

Whether you're looking for a nostalgic treat or simply want to indulge in some quality ice cream, Mrs Curl Ice Cream is a must-visit. It's the perfect spot to cool off on a hot day, without breaking the bank. With its charming ambiance and delectable flavors, Mrs Curl Ice Cream has earned its place as a local favorite.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"I had such an amazing experience here. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by enthusiasm and smiles. The location is absolutely gorgeous, and extremely relaxing. My dental hygienist was wonderful, her name is was Joy. I highly recommend her. I had had several negative dental experiences in the past, and she was very in tune with making sure that I was comfortable. Everything was so relaxing here. They had piano music playing, warm blankets and snacks and beverages. The dental chairs are facing a wall of windows that look out to beautiful trees and nature. Again, it is extremely relaxing. 

 Dr. Atchley and Dr. Couzens were so informative and truly interested in answering my questions and helping me achieve what I want with my dental work. I felt like they were visionaries. I shared with them my insecurities with my teeth and they gave me practical solutions that I did not know existed. I was so impressed with how much they seemed to care about my teeth, which was so refreshing after having very negative dental experiences.

Basically they can accommodate anything that you want done cosmetically or just regular dentist work. Also my insurance covered the majority of the bill. I saw someone say that their insurance didn't cover the newer technology that they use, bit it did for me. Plus the new technology that they use to clean your teeth makes it less painful and quicker. To anyone who has had a negative experience with a dentist, this place will ease your fear. I highly recommend it!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Well, this is like getting swimming lessons before dipping your toe into the pool under the watchful eye of a lifeguard rather than being thrown off the high dive into the cold, scary deep end with no warning.  

Or, to say it in fewer words, Pirate's Alley is great for beginner absinthe drinkers.  They feature multiple brands and are patient and willing to explain the difference in flavors (licorice versus mint or a mixture of both) in order to help you pick your poison.  Then, you get to watch as they light your sugar cube on fire, slowly drip water over the sugar cube on a fancy spoon, and then mix up a licorice and/or minty concotion.  

I hung around for a couple of days and noticed that one of the (off-duty) bartenders likes her absinthe mixed with cranberry juice.  An interesting concotion that I have yet to try ...

"Roy's Restaurant truly stands out as a pinnacle of culinary delight, meriting a rare and resounding 5-star rating. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was greeted by the warm ambiance and a staff team whose attentiveness was both impeccable and genuine. 

The menu boasted an array of innovative dishes, each with a description more tantalizing than the last. For the appetizer, the seared scallops were a revelation – perfectly golden and tender, nestled on a bed of subtly spiced puree that accentuated their natural sweetness. 

The main course featured a succulent filet mignon, cooked to perfection with a char that sealed in a cascade of juices, pairing exquisitely with the accompanying wine reduction and a side of the silkiest mashed potatoes. 

Dessert was an odyssey in itself. The chocolate lava cake was nothing short of ecstatic – a rich, flowing heart enveloped by a tender crust, harmonizing with the raspberry coulis and a quenelle of vanilla bean ice cream.

It's not just the food that makes Roy's Restaurant phenomenal; it's the entirety of the experience. From the attentive service to the elegant atmosphere and, of course, the delectable cuisine, every aspect coalesces into an unforgettable dining adventure. I recommend Roy's to anyone seeking a meal that will grace their palate with sheer gastronomic magic.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"It appears there's a bit of a mix-up in your request—as ""Commerce Bank"" suggests a financial institution rather than a dining establishment. However, assuming for creative purposes that there is a restaurant named ""Commerce Bank,"" here's a fictional review based on your specifications:

---

Dining at ""Commerce Bank"" was an experience that truly paid dividends in culinary delight, warranting a solid 5-star rating for exceptional service, ambiance, and gastronomy.

From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was greeted by an elegant fusion of modern and classic decor, reminiscent of a grandiose banker's hall turned gourmet paradise. The setting struck a perfect balance between opulence and comfort, making it an ideal backdrop for the evening's feast.

The menu, an extensive portfolio of international cuisine, promised an ambitious tour of flavors. To start, I chose the seared scallops atop a creamy parsnip puree—a dish that was executed with precision, the scallops perfectly golden and tender. 

For the main course, I indulged in the signature ""Banker's Cut""—a ribeye steak, aged and cooked to a faultless medium-rare, accompanied by a red wine reduction that was both rich and velvety, enhancing the meat's natural flavors without overpowering them.

A thoughtful pause between courses allowed for the appreciation of the wine selection, carefully curated to complement the menu, from which the sommelier recommended a bold, yet smooth, Malbec that was a triumph in its own right.

Dessert was an extravagant affair, a deconstructed tiramisu that managed to respect traditional flavors while presenting them in a novel and visually stunning manner. The layers of mascarpone, espresso-soaked sponge, and cocoa were a crescendo of the meal, sending my taste buds soaring with every spoonful.

Service throughout the evening was impeccable—a testament to the staff's passion and professionalism. Every recommendation was spot-on, every need anticipated with care.

""Commerce Bank"" didn't just serve a meal; it provided a memorable experience, a merger of fine ingredients, culinary artistry, and the kind of hospitality that makes you eager to invest in a return visit. Simply put, it was a five-star affair throughout, one that couldn't come more highly recommended.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

He came right over to our table with glasses and shortly after, with the first bottle of wine to try.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Manny Brown's and I must say, it was quite an enjoyable experience. From the moment I walked in, the warm and cozy atmosphere made me feel right at home. The dim lighting, rustic decor, and comfortable seating arrangements created a relaxed ambiance that was perfect for a casual evening out.

The service at Manny Brown's was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They greeted me with a smile and promptly seated me at a table. Throughout the evening, my server was efficient and made sure that I had everything I needed. I appreciated their enthusiasm in answering all my questions about the menu and even providing suggestions for drink pairings.

Speaking of the menu, Manny Brown's offers a diverse selection of dishes that cater to a variety of tastes. Whether you're in the mood for a juicy steak, fresh seafood, or mouthwatering vegetarian options, there is something for everyone here. The food is prepared with care and using high-quality ingredients, resulting in dishes that are bursting with flavor. I particularly enjoyed the perfectly grilled salmon, cooked to perfection and served with a delightful side of roasted vegetables.

The presentation of the dishes at Manny Brown's is also worth mentioning. Each plate was beautifully arranged, showcasing the attention to detail in both taste and aesthetics. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left feeling satisfied.

The only reason I did not award Manny Brown's a full 5-star rating is because the dessert options were a bit limited. While the options they did have were delicious, I would have liked to see a wider variety to choose from. That being said, this was a minor issue in an otherwise fantastic dining experience.

Overall, Manny Brown's is a restaurant that I would highly recommend. The combination of ambiance, excellent service, and mouthwatering dishes make it a place you won't want to miss. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two or a catch-up session with friends, Manny Brown's is a great choice. I will certainly be returning in the near future to sample more of their delectable offerings.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"Prime Time Donair & Kabab is an absolute gem in the bustling culinary scene of the city. I recently had the pleasure of dining at this delightful establishment, and I must say that it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I entered, I was greeted with warm smiles and impeccable service, setting the tone for an unforgettable dining experience.

The ambiance of the restaurant is inviting and comfortable, with soft lighting and sleek modern decor. The seating arrangement is spacious, allowing for a relaxed and intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones. The atmosphere exudes a sense of warmth and hospitality, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.

Now, let's talk about the main attraction - the food. Prime Time Donair & Kabab offers an extensive menu that caters to all taste buds. As a lover of Middle Eastern cuisine, I was thrilled to see the variety of options available. From flavorful kebabs to mouthwatering donairs, every dish is prepared with utmost care and attention to detail. The flavors were bold, authentic, and truly tantalizing.

I started my culinary journey with the hummus and pita bread appetizer, which was an absolute delight. The hummus was creamy and rich, perfectly complemented by the warm and soft pita bread. For the main course, I opted for the mixed grill platter, which included perfectly grilled chicken, lamb, and beef. The meats were tender, succulent, and bursting with flavor. The dish was impeccably presented, with vibrant garnishes that added a touch of elegance.

Apart from the exceptional food, the service at Prime Time Donair & Kabab is second to none. The staff members are knowledgeable and passionate, always ready to offer suggestions and help you navigate the menu.

"I had a very positive experience at Bijou. I walked in very nervous that Bijou wouldn't carry any samples that would fit, but my consultant, Nikki, quickly made it clear that she would make it work! She got so creative pinning the dresses and making sure that they were appropriate to walk out with! I tried on quite a few dresses here that I really liked. 

Also, the store is clean and beautiful and the dressing rooms are pretty spacious. It did feel a little like the running of the bulls, though, when the store opened and a few brides also had appointments. Everyone was running around the store grabbing dresses off the racks like they were on sale. 

Although I didn't ultimately purchase my dress here, the dress that I did purchase was similar to one of the biggest contenders at Bijou. I couldn't commit to Bijou because the sample of my favorite dress was just too small to really envision how it would look on me. The biggest downfall is that you can't take photos, so I couldn't compare it to other dresses. That was exceptionally difficult!

Overall, though, my experience at Bijou was very positive, and Nikki was a great consultant who really worked hard to get creative with some of the dresses! Thanks, Nikki!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Freebirds' eclectic vibe and customizable burrito options promise an exciting dining experience; however, my visit landed a median three-star rating. The venue's commitment to fresh ingredients was apparent, and the option to tailor every aspect of my burrito—from the type of beans to the heat level of the salsa—was a highlight. The menu variety caters to different tastes with an array of Tex-Mex staples that are flavorful and satisfying. 

The staff was friendly but seemed overwhelmed during peak hours, leading to a longer wait time than expected. While the burritos were generously stuffed, the meats lacked the juicy, memorable punch I've encountered at similar establishments. Also, the prices felt slightly steep for the overall quality and portion size delivered. 

In terms of atmosphere, Freebirds has a quirky charm and energy that add to the casual dining experience. Unfortunately, the noise level was a bit intrusive, making conversation a challenge.

"I recently visited FanDuel Sportsbook and Horse Racing and had a mixed experience. The restaurant is located in a prime location and has ample parking space, which is a definite plus. The staff was friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome from the moment we walked in.

The ambiance of the restaurant was vibrant, with a sports-themed decor that added to the overall atmosphere. However, the noise level was quite high, making it difficult to hold a conversation at times.

The menu offered a good variety of options, with a focus on sports-themed dishes. While some of the dishes were flavorful and well-prepared, others fell short in terms of taste and presentation. The portion sizes were also quite small for the price, leaving us wanting more.

One highlight of the visit was the extensive selection of beverages, including a wide range of beers on tap. The bar area was well-stocked and provided a great place to unwind while watching a game.

The horse racing aspect of the establishment was interesting, and it added an unique element to the experience. However, it would have been nice to have more interactive options or a designated viewing area for the races.

Overall, my experience at FanDuel Sportsbook and Horse Racing was average. While there were some positives, such as the friendly staff and vibrant ambiance, the food and portion sizes left something to be desired.

"Drexel University - Center City Hahnemann Campus Bookstore is my go-to place when I need a quick snack or a last-minute greeting card. Located conveniently in the building where I work, it offers a decent selection of snacks and beverages. However, I have to admit that my visits to this bookstore are often accompanied by a sense of reluctance.

The main reason for this reluctance is the lack of friendliness displayed by the staff. Despite the store not being particularly busy, I often feel like I'm a burden to the cashiers. It's never pleasant to be treated in such a manner, especially when I make an effort to be polite and friendly during my shopping experience.

Despite this, I do appreciate the fact that the bookstore generally has a good sale selection. It's always nice to be able to snag a good deal on a book or some other merchandise. The discounted prices make up for some of the shortcomings in customer service.

Additionally, I find it somewhat perplexing when students complain about the cost of textbooks. In my opinion, textbooks have always been and will continue to be expensive. It's simply something that comes with the territory of higher education. However, for those who feel they will only need a textbook for one term and never again, I would suggest considering renting instead of buying. There are numerous websites dedicated to textbook rentals, which can provide a more cost-effective solution.

In conclusion, while the Drexel University - Center City Hahnemann Campus Bookstore offers convenience and a decent selection, the lack of friendly service is disappointing. Nevertheless, the store's sale selection and the options for renting textbooks provide some value. Considering these factors, I would rate my overall experience with this bookstore as 4 out of 5 stars.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

Best serves hands down! We had Eva wait on us both times we stopped here. I hope I got her name right I do remember she had a son and was originally from California. She was so wonderful to our son. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and very quick witted. She was so attentive to us that she realized our drinks were low before we did! The food was served hot and fresh with the most pleasant attitude. We were treated like we were the owners or a food critic! She even made a special drink for my son. I've never in my life time seen a sever take it to this leave of professionalism and personal touch all in one! The manager is wonderful. He has the most wonderful presence of any manager I've ever met. Please do your self a favor and have lunch here. Ever one we came in contact with just was outstanding.

"Review 1: What a fantastic experience I had at Hibachi 2 Go! I ordered their Hibachi Chicken and it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was perfectly grilled and seasoned, and the portion size was generous. The hibachi fried rice was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The best part was the show they put on while preparing the food right in front of me. It was so entertaining and added an extra level of excitement to my meal.

Felix has the same distributor for oysters every morning. Our waitress was very kind to tell us more about the food and how they operate. She even gave us some tips to the town and what locals like to do. Service at Felix is GREAT. Food however, we wouldn't come back. The sauce for their chargrilled oysters is just not up to standards.

"As a dedicated connoisseur of smoky, savory delights, I approached King Ribs Bar-B-Q with high expectations, and I am pleased to report that every aspect of my dining experience was nothing short of spectacular – tipping the scales of barbeque excellence and easily deserving a five-star accolade.

The ambiance of King Ribs was comfortably unpretentious, with the aroma of hickory-smoked meats enveloping you like a welcome embrace from an old friend. The walls, adorned with vintage BBQ paraphernalia and the gentle hum of blues, added to the establishment’s charm, creating a rustic and authentic vibe.

Service was brisk and personable right from the start. Our server, vibrant and knowledgeable, navigated us through the menu, recommending the house specials with a charming zeal. It was clear that the staff was proud of their craft, a precursor to the unforgettable meal that followed.

I kicked off my culinary adventure with a starter of fried green tomatoes, which set the bar with their crispy exterior and tangy interior – a Southern classic done right. But the true stars, the ribs, were a masterclass in BBQ. They arrived glistening under the lighting, a sticky testimony to the hours of slow cooking and care that had lovingly gone into their preparation. The meat, tender and succulent, effortlessly fell off the bone, each bite bursting with a symphony of flavors – the smokiness, the subtle sweetness of the glaze, the robustness of the rub – all in perfect harmony.

Accompanying the ribs were sides that would make any Southern grandma nod in approval. The collard greens carried a hint of smokiness, while the mac 'n' cheese was a creamy treasure trove of comfort.

King Ribs Bar-B-Q, you’ve outdone yourselves. Your passion for BBQ shines through in every morsel, turning a simple meal into a memorable feast. It is with an overjoyed heart and a sated palate that I wholeheartedly recommend this temple of barbeque to all who yearn for the authentic taste of the American South.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Nestled in the heart of a vibrant city, Santa Barbara Bowl offered me a dining experience that resonated with the charm of its namesake. From the moment I stepped in, I was embraced by a warm, inviting atmosphere that promised an unforgettable evening.

The service was impeccable, attentive without being intrusive, a perfect dance of courteousness and efficiency. As for the menu, it was a love letter to the palate. I started with a delicate amuse-bouche that set the stage, leading me seamlessly into a symphony of flavors. The highlight was the signature bowl - a medley of locally sourced, crisp vegetables and succulent protein, harmoniously married with an exquisite, zesty sauce that tied every note together.

Each bite was a celebration, a culinary crescendo that played out across a beautifully orchestrated plate. The side dishes complimented the main ensemble gracefully, accentuating without overpowering. As for dessert, it was a sonnet of sweetness, the perfect endnote to a gastronomic masterpiece.

The ambiance beckoned a laid-back yet refined vibe, complemented by a selection of fine wines that whispered of faraway vineyards and sun-drenched afternoons. The Santa Barbara Bowl managed to encapsulate not just the essence of local cuisine but also the spirit of the region itself.

In summation, my five-star rating is a testament to an evening where every element sang in perfect harmony. From the first greeting to the last farewell, the Santa Barbara Bowl was not just a meal but a memory etched into the taste buds. An unequivocal recommendation for anyone seeking culinary delight.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I like to eat and I've become a decent cook on my own.  So when I go out to eat, I love when a restaurant takes ingredients I am familiar with and puts them in combinations that totally exceed my expectations.  That happened at Gregory's!

I went to dinner on a quiet Tuesday evening.  I've had some home made attempts at Russian cuisine, but never been to an authentic Russian restaurant.  So, I wasn't sure what to expect.  What I found was a relatable selection that made me wonder why I had never thought of the flavor combinations before.  Very approachable food and so much was delicious!

I started with a Baltika No 3 Classic Beer (4.8%).  Though on the pricey side since it is imported from Russia, the nearly full pint bottle was chilled and full of flavor.

Before long, my Pierozki appetizer arrived.  This four piece serving of puffed pastry filled with a combination of minced beef, pork, and chicken was light and flaky.  The pastry was so light that bits of pastry stuck to my lips with each bite.  Inside, the flavor was very subtle and reminded me of the tenderest of meat in a Philly steak.  Subtle at first, my taste buds quickly adjusted to the light seasoning that let the meat flavors work with the buttery taste of the pastry.  I was surprised how light the appetizer was.  I didn't feel stuffed even after eating all four pieces.

Before I finished my appetizer, my entree of Sauteed Beef (Zharkoe Goulash) arrived.  I remember my mom's goulash and it was not very good. So when I took my first bite of this slow cooked beef, onions, and mushrooms in a brown gravy, my expectations were greatly exceeded!  If you order this, definitely dip your fork in the sour cream served on the side.  The bit of tartness in the cream added another layer of flavor to the beef mixture.  Fantastic and fork tender!

I got to pick two sides, so I went with the sauteed veggies and the ""carrots in milk sauce"".  The veggies were cooked through thoroughly and had a great deal of butter on top.  All the flavors were released and though I sometimes like al dente, I have to admit for the combo of veggies served, the taste was spot on.

Oh, and the carrots in milk sauce were the highlights of the plate.  The long slices of carrots were also cooked thoroughly and served in a sauce that reminded me of condensed sweet cream!  So sweet and delicious, paired with the buttery veggies and savory beef dinner made a meal full of flavors that hit on all the taste buds!

I couldn't pass up on one of the house made desserts.  I opted for the Napolean which was chilled and had just enough chocolate sauce to make this dessert shine.  Highly recommended too!

Since it was early on a weeknight, there wasn't any live entertainment, but because the evening was slow, I enjoyed talking with the owner/hostess/waitress and felt very welcomed.  She pointed out how they grind their own meats, make their own desserts, and try to be as authentic as possible.  Very pleasant conversation and she welcomed that I drove an hour from the southwest side just to try the place.  It's a trip I would and mostly likely will do so again soon!

"Venturing into P'unk Burger, my senses were immediately engulfed by the sizzle of grills and the warm ambiance of a laid-back, yet trendy burger haven. The decor, with its funky art and eclectic flair, whispered of a dining experience that prides itself on uniqueness and casual charm.

Service here was swift and personable—the staff seemed genuinely enthusiastic to share their menu knowledge. I was charmed by the variety of burger creations, from traditional beef to inventive alternatives like the tangy and delectable Ahi Tuna burger. The option to build my own burger was a gastronomic playground, allowing for the fusion of bold flavors like wasabi with the fresh bite of arugula.

Each bite was a melody of tastes, their in-house signature P'unk sauce threading each mouthful with a savory note that beckoned for another. Accompaniments did not fall short; the crispy old bay tater tots were a comfort side reimagined, their crusty exteriors hiding pillowy potato within.

Not to reach perfection, one encounter with a slightly overcooked patty held back that coveted fifth star. However, the commitment to sustainability and locally-sourced ingredients made up for this minor lapse in culinary execution.

P'unk Burger’s craft sodas and milkshakes concluded the meal on a high, sweet note, wrapping up an experience that was both satisfying and conscious. In summary, P'unk Burger is a gem in the rough, a four-star establishment where indulgence marries originality with a side of responsible dining.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Chez Leon is a hidden gem tucked away in the heart of the city. From the moment I stepped inside, I felt welcomed by the warm and inviting ambiance. The restaurant exudes a classy yet cozy atmosphere with its dim lighting and chic decor.

The service at Chez Leon was impeccable. The staff members were attentive and went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was flawless. They were knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations. I appreciated their professionalism and friendly demeanor.

The menu at Chez Leon offers a tantalizing array of dishes that cater to a variety of palates. Being a seafood lover, I opted for the grilled salmon, and it did not disappoint. The fish was cooked to perfection - juicy, flaky, and bursting with flavor. The accompanying seasonal vegetables were fresh and vibrant, complementing the dish beautifully.

One highlight of my dining experience was the presentation of each dish. The attention to detail was evident in the way the food was plated. It was like a work of art that was almost too beautiful to eat. The flavors matched the visual appeal, and every bite was a delight to the senses.

The only reason I deducted a star from my rating was due to the slightly limited vegetarian options on the menu. While the dishes available were delicious, I believe Chez Leon could benefit from expanding its vegetarian offerings to cater to a wider range of guests.

Overall, my dining experience at Chez Leon was delightful. The ambiance, service, and food combined to create an unforgettable meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an upscale dining experience with a touch of sophistication. I will definitely be returning to Chez Leon in the near future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Apologies for the confusion, but it appears there has been a mix-up. Calvert's Express Auto Service & Tire is an auto service and tire establishment and is not a restaurant. It seems you've mistaken it for a dining spot.

However, if you're looking for a review of the excellent service received at Calvert's Express in the context of auto services, here's an example with a similarly positive tone:

My visit to Calvert's Express Auto Service & Tire was an overwhelmingly positive experience. As soon as I drove in, the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff was apparent. The team's eagerness to assist and explain the services required for my vehicle was a breath of fresh air in the often-opaque world of auto maintenance.

I was there for a simple tire rotation and balance, but the staff treated the task with the utmost seriousness, ensuring my car was in top condition. The waiting room was clean and comfortable, and I was pleasantly surprised to find complimentary refreshments, which made the brief wait pass by quickly. Upon completion of the service, the technician took the time to walk me through what was done and provided valuable advice on future maintenance without any pressure for unnecessary up-sells.

The pricing was fair, especially considering the level of service provided. My car drove smoothly as I left, and I had every bit of confidence that quality work had been done. Experiences like this restore my faith in the auto service industry. I wholeheartedly give Calvert's Express Auto Service & Tire a five-star rating and would recommend them to anyone in need of reliable, professional, and friendly car care.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The selection of sausages and cheeses is impressive, and each one is bursting with flavor. But it's the cakes that stole the show for me. The chocolate mousse cake was the epitome of decadence and left me craving for more.

"I went here with my new boyfriend and we tried quiet a few things off of the menu and were only so-so in our over-all opinion. Also service and atmosphere was a bit lacking. 

We ordered: 
Apps: Chicken Satay and Crab Rangoon.  ... These both were probably the best things we had that meal. The cr ab rangoon were well fried and had a nice flavor without too much creamcheese or too much wanton. For those that care, the wantons were ""egg roll"" style, the thicker crispier wanton not ""spring roll"" thin style. Typical sweetened creamcheese/onion/imitation crab filling, but with a creamier texture than some places. The chicken satay weren't SUPER fresh in taste/texture but I think that is just the way the marinade process works at some places. Seriously wasn't ""old' by any means. 

Entrees: Zen steak and Spicy Basil Beef  ... Zen steak kind of sucked and didn't seem like a great cut of beef or well prepared. It had no sauce or marinade on it, as suggested by the menu, as far as we could tell. Instead there was a cold, extremely delicious and flavorful sauce on the side. My how we would have LOVED that sauce on a well prepared steak. It arrived with nice plating, though. Kudos to that. My Spicy Basil Beef lacked spice and basil, but was in an otherwise somewhat flavorful sauce so it wasn't exactly disappointing. I haven't ever ordered a sliced beef entree at thai places. I usually go for chicken or tofu, personally. The beef was the wet kind of slices typical of ""beef and broccoli' or whatever at a Chinese restaurant. 

I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was yummy. Obviously made with real thai tea! 

So... I don't know if we'll return but if they were closer I would definitely give them another few chances. I have only started to eat Thai in Missouri after eating it all over the east and west coasts around Boston, NY, San Fran and San Diego... so only time will tell whether this is stellar for MO or not.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"One of my watches -- that I took to Batteries Plus -- has a perpetual calendar -- special battery required. Batteries Plus told me to bring it back in a week, and the battery should be in stock.

Well, I waited close to a month, taking in the watch September 4. Battery was not in stock.

They sent me to Huffman Jewelers. THEY told me it was a special battery that had to be ordered. I get it. I've been told.

About a week to wait. That's OK.

They called this morning (September 10) that the watch was ready. It works. It cost $25. Damn, expensive watch battery for a Seiko watch.

"Two Ten Jack is an absolute gem of a restaurant. From start to finish, my experience was nothing short of exceptional. The moment I walked in, the ambiance was inviting and the staff greeted me with warm smiles.

I started off with the octopus hushpuppies, and let me tell you, it was love at first bite. The combination of the crispy exterior and the tender octopus inside was a match made in culinary heaven. I was a bit hesitant about trying octopus, but Two Ten Jack has completely changed my perception.

Next up, I tried the tebasaki, which are chicken wings coated in a mayonnaise sauce. While the concept sounded intriguing, the taste didn't quite hit the mark for me. The sauce lacked the sweetness I was hoping for, and instead tasted slightly bitter. It was the only disappointment in an otherwise outstanding meal.

On the other hand, the garlic crab noodles were a true delight. The fragrant garlic infused the noodles with a heavenly aroma, and the crab added a delicious seafood flavor that balanced perfectly with the dish. I couldn't get enough of it.

To round out my dining experience, I indulged in the cremini mushroom skewer. The mushrooms were perfectly grilled, with a smoky flavor that complemented their earthy taste. It was a simple yet satisfying dish, showcasing the culinary expertise of Two Ten Jack.

"My experience at Saki Endless Sushi & Hibachi Eatery was overall satisfactory. As an avid lover of sushi and hibachi, I was excited to try out this restaurant after hearing positive reviews from friends. Upon entry, I was greeted by a friendly host and seated promptly.

The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, with dim lighting and an energetic atmosphere. The sound of sizzling hibachi and the chatter of customers added to the lively feel. The menu offered a wide variety of options, from classic sushi rolls to an extensive hibachi selection.

The sushi rolls I ordered were fresh and flavorful. The presentation was visually appealing, although some rolls seemed a bit smaller than I anticipated. The hibachi grill performance was entertaining, with the chef skillfully flipping and tossing ingredients in front of us. The portions, however, were slightly underwhelming compared to other hibachi restaurants I've visited.

Service was attentive and accommodating. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions based on our preferences. However, there were a few instances where our drinks were not refilled promptly, and we had to request service.

One disappointment was the lack of vegetarian options. Although there were a few vegetarian rolls available, the hibachi menu had limited selections for non-meat eaters. I would have appreciated a wider variety of vegetable options or tofu alternatives.

The prices were reasonable for the quality of food and experience. However, I felt that some items were slightly overpriced, especially considering the portion sizes. The value for money could be improved.

Overall, Saki Endless Sushi & Hibachi Eatery provided a decent dining experience. While the ambiance, service, and sushi were enjoyable, the limited vegetarian options and slightly underwhelming portion sizes left room for improvement. With some adjustments, this restaurant has the potential to be a go-to spot for sushi and hibachi lovers.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

For my meal, I selected the savory 'Jetson'—a juicy burger that did not disappoint. It was cooked to perfection and the brioche bun deserves a special mention for its buttery, pillowy texture. The side of hand-cut fries was a comforting companion to the main and was served steaming hot and well-seasoned.

The service at The Pop Shop was efficient and the staff was friendly, though at peak times it felt a touch hurried, which is the only reason this experience didn't quite hit the 5-star mark. Dessert was a sweet treat—the classic milkshake was rich and creamy, taking me down the memory lane of authentic American diners.

The atmosphere struck a delicate balance between upscale sophistication and inviting warmth. The staff, dressed immaculately, welcomed us with genuine smiles, setting the tone for what was to be a stellar evening.

Our server was the epitome of hospitality, offering insightful recommendations and ensuring our every need was met without being intrusive. A delicate dance of attentiveness and discretion made us feel both cared for and comfortable.

As for the cuisine, it soared beyond my expectations. We started with the seared scallops, each perfectly bronzed and resting on a bed of velvety cauliflower purée - a harmonious marriage of texture and taste. For the main course, the braised short ribs were a revelation. The meat was succulent and tender, effortlessly yielding to the mere nudge of a fork, while the accompanying red wine reduction elevated the dish to a symphony of deep, robust flavors.

The pinnacle of the evening, however, was the dessert. The chocolate lava cake, with its rich, molten center, was a decadent finale that left us savoring each bite. To pair with our meals, the wine list showcased a thoughtful selection, each vintage chosen to complement the dishes splendidly.

"Found myself over on Fowler and eyed Portillo's - famous for their Chicago roast beef. I accepted the mission and went undercover to see what was generating all the buzz and fuss.

I walked thru the doors and back in time to Gangster and gilded Chicago. Everywhere you look there are pictures and items from a time long past when men wore a stern look, carried a tommy gun and ate slow cooked roast beef dipped in ""gravy"".

I gotta say - I now understand better. This food rocks tradition AND taste. This Portillo's is immaculately clean and the good was hot and fresh. 

I tried the sausage and beef sandwich w hot peppers and my Padawan went for a dipped beef & mozzarella. Both were delicious and reminded her of her mother's hot roast beef sandwiches.

"The Hotel Provincial is an excellent guest house on the quiet side of the French Quarter (closer toward Esplanade). Though I didn't see any ghosts, it is supposed to be a very haunted place given that a portion of the hotel was once a military hospital. Supposedly, people have seen the specters of bloody soldiers appear and disappear (especially in building 5). But even if a haunted hotel doesn't top your list of places to stay, the Provincial is worth looking into. Amenities include 2 pools, free continental breakfast, valet (at $18 per day, which isn't bad for the Quarter). Guest rooms are quite beautiful. If you prefer a quiet room, request one that is not located facing the main courtyard, where the sounds of guests (who can sometimes get loud by the pool) really bounce of the walls. During your stay, ask the front desk about nightly walking tours of haunted New Orleans; they are fun and totally worth the price!

- Vegetarian quesadilla ($11) - you get a pretty big portion that comes with black beans, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and spinach. Also, you get a side of guacamole which my other friend said could eat on it's own!
- Chipotle chicken quesadilla ($11) - comes with chipotle chicken, sautéed onion and cheese. Same guacamole side dish. 
- Chicken enchilada with verde sauce ($15) - same as I ordered last time. Told my buddy to try it. 3 enchiladas, rice and beans. My friend ended up having to leave so I got to take this leftovers home (score!)
- Conchinita pibil ($16) - A Yucatan specialty, citrus marinated pork baked in banana leaf. Reminded me of pulled pork but much more tender and flavours were much more delicious. Comes with side of rice, beans and a couple tortilla wraps if you want to make your own little wraps.

Anyways, still my favourite Mexican place in Edmonton!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Went with a friend a little while ago and it was our first time trying them. I needed to get my nails done for an important party and I was treating my friend for her birthday. Loved it! We had to wait about 20 mins past our booked time but we were fine with that. The seating area is neat and very comfortable.

Once they were able to start working on us, we  had a great time. The lady who did my nails was super nice and kept up a great conversation. The manipedi we got was fantastic too. We booked and came at around 6 pm because we had just finished work, and since it takes an hour each for a mani and a pedi, our treatment went all the way ti closing time. 

The ladies were super nice and even stayed til the last second just so that mine and my friend's nails would have a better chance of drying and setting before we had to head out.

"Vida is hands down my favorite restaurant in Indy to enjoy company, good food, and beautiful atmosphere. I came here, with reservations, on a Saturday night, eager to try the 6 course chef's tasting. The menu was fresh, bold, and also came with an optional expertly created wine pairing. 

We started at the bar, as we briefly waited for our table. We got the Folklore (a mixed cocktail with amazing ginger beer), the History Eraser (egg white foam cocktail with a sweet kick), and the Good Night & Good Luck (a delicious rum forward drink). We agreed the flavor of the Folklore was the most enticing for us.

We ordered the chef's tasting after reviewing that and the 4 course meal option. My favorite course was the scallops, but the chocolate cake with candied citrus and pistachios was a close second. The food came out at a fantastic pace, and everyone was very knowledgeable about the dishes and provided us detailed, pleasant explanations of each of the dishes.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Venturing off the beaten path, I stumbled upon B & C Melrose BBQ, and I'm elated to report it was well worth the detour. This gem offers a vivacious nod to classic Southern comfort with a no-frills atmosphere that emphasizes the food's flair rather than extravagant decor.

Upon arrival, the aroma of smoked meats filled the air, fostering an authentic BBQ ambiance. The staff welcomed us with the warm Southern hospitality you'd hope for at a BBQ joint. We started with the smoked wings as an appetizer, which were succulently seasoned and set the stage for the meal ahead.

For the main course, the pulled pork plate was tender, moist, and perfectly smoked, pairing beautifully with their tangy house BBQ sauce. The sides are far from an afterthought; the baked beans harbored a depth of flavor and bits of brisket that were delightfully unexpected, while the coleslaw provided a refreshing crunch.

However, the ribs, though flavorful with a satisfying smoky essence, were slightly less tender than my companion and I prefer, preventing a full five-star rating. Portions were generous, ensuring that no patron left hungry.

Dessert offerings seemed to humbly boast of Southern roots, and the peach cobbler we shared was a quintessential end to our meal – warm, comforting, and reminiscent of a bygone era.

B & C Melrose BBQ has etched itself as a noteworthy spot on my BBQ go-to list, portraying an honest representation of Southern BBQ. In a world that often mistakes extravagance for quality, this place reminds us that sometimes, simplicity harmonized with passion is the secret ingredient to a truly enjoyable meal. 4 stars out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"At Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe - Keystone Crossing, I found a delightful reprieve from the usual dining experiences. The cafe exudes a warm, welcoming atmosphere, capturing the essence of Mediterranean comfort. Service was attentive, contributing to a pleasant meal.

I savored a variety of menu offerings, starting with a zesty Greek salad with crisp vegetables that tasted garden-fresh. The highlight, however, was the Grilled Chicken Gyro; the chicken was well-seasoned and succulent - truly mouthwatering. Alongside, the homemade Taziki sauce added a creamy and tangy counterpoint that was unforgettable.

While most of the meal impressed, the pita served on the side was slightly underwhelming – it lacked the expected fluffiness and warmth. 

Nevertheless, Taziki's successfully brought the essence of the Mediterranean to Keystone Crossing with an array of flavorful dishes. High-quality ingredients, combined with a casually elegant setting, made for an enjoyable dining experience. Four stars - I'll surely return.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Secondly, the attitude of the staff was disappointing. During my last visit, I was met with rudeness when I inquired about purchasing a pretzel just before closing time.

"We stumbled in here for lunch because I was craving sushi and wanted to try some place new.  So I yelped and found this 4.5 star sushi spot in washington square.  Being 4.5 stars on yelp, I had some expectations.  The inside is fairly small, with mainly tables along the walls, pretty tightly packed.  So tight that if you are just a little overweight, you might not be able to squeeze through the tables to get into the wall side booth seating.  It is pretty small and cozy.

We ordered the spicy 3 which came with a miso soup, also ordered the philadelphia roll and pennsylvania roll.  The spicy 3 included 24 pieces of sushi combo of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon.  When it came out, I seriously could not distinguish which was tuna, salmon, or yellowtail because they looked exactly the same in color which is odd because yellowtail is lighter in color, should be clear.  The fish did not taste fresh at all.  To be honest, it tasted like the typically sushi you find at the mall.  Even wegman's sushi is better than this.  
On the other hand, I found the Miso soup to be pretty delicious and flavorful served on a unique looking fish bowl and soup spoon that I almost wanted to take home.  Overall, their sushi is really mediocre but I guess you get what you pay for.  FYI, this is a BYOB.  Sushi restaurants are a huge competition in the city because there is just so many to choose from.  This one really need to step it up compared to fat salmon, vic sushi, etc.

As for the service, it is just SO SO - being that it is kind of an asian restaurant, I don't expect much when it comes to service as usual.  But I asked for a box for the rest of the sushi and he either forgot or just ignored it.  Either way, we left without packing, sushi wasn't good anyway, I probably would not have finished it by home.  I definitely won't be back.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I seriously love District. So much. I didn't think that I would.

 A friend suggested it for lunch one day and I was all like, ""ugh, sliders? No thanks. I don't like sliders. They're a tease. I want a full sized sandwich, not a tease of a sandwich.""

The same friend suggested it weeks later for lunch and being the hard headed stubborn girl that I am, turned my nose up at the invitation again.

Third time's a charm, right? The third time it was suggested I finally relented. All I could think was how stupid I'd been for not coming sooner.

Walk into the cool space after parking in the free lot next door. Place your order at the counter and have a seat while taking in the beautiful exposed brick walls and smiling back at the friendly people working here. Wait for your name to be called,  jump up and quickly walk to get those sliders (which are NOT a tease) and enjoy some of the most creative sandwiches.  I've tried a few and they are all really good. My favorite was the pork belly...OMG heaven in your mouth. Tender and flavorful and just delicious. The fried chicken one was really great, too. Today I tried a special slider. It was a fried oyster topped with alfalfa sprouts and a pork rind with aioli sauce. Ok. I don't even like fried oysters or pork rinds and I even loved this one.

The menu at Yakitori Boy boasts an impressive array of Japanese dishes, particularly specializing in mouthwatering yakitori skewers. I was thoroughly impressed with the variety of options available, ranging from classic chicken and beef skewers to unique and creative combinations like bacon-wrapped asparagus. Each skewer was cooked to perfection, with the meat tender and juicy, and the flavors exploding in my mouth.

What also stood out at Yakitori Boy was the impeccable service. The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They graciously offered suggestions when I was undecided and made sure that my dining experience was top-notch from start to finish. The waiter even took the time to explain the different types of sake available, and recommended a fantastic pairing for my meal.

The overall atmosphere at Yakitori Boy was lively yet intimate, with a delightful background of Japanese music that added to the authenticity of the experience. The open kitchen allowed me to witness the chefs' culinary skills firsthand, and it was truly impressive to see them expertly grilling the skewers.

One last detail that added to the overall enjoyment of the evening was the reasonable pricing. Given the quality of the food and the level of service, I found the prices to be incredibly fair and affordable.

The staff at Wet Willie's deserve accolades for their impeccable service. Attentive and friendly, they ensured our evening was enjoyable without being intrusive. It's apparent that customer satisfaction is a top priority for them.

A highlight of Wet Willie's is undoubtedly its culinary offerings. The menu is a cornucopia of innovative dishes that tantalize the taste buds. My palate was particularly impressed with the chef's ability to balance flavors—each dish was an adventure in gastronomy.

But what truly sets Wet Willie's apart is their drink selection. The cocktails are crafted with an artisan's touch, boasting fresh ingredients and a creative twist.

A standout moment was indulging in the Tostones Con Queso—crisp, savory bliss paired elegantly with a dollop of creamy cheese. The balance of textures and flavors was impeccable. Bodega's drink selection didn't disappoint either; the hibiscus lemonade was an exquisite companion to my meal, with just the right zing to refresh the palate.

If I had to quibble, the noise level occasionally rose above a comfortable ambiance, which, while indicative of a lively atmosphere, sometimes bordered on disruptive.

The menu, an ode to Americana with a twist of ingenuity, offered an extensive selection of gourmet burgers, each named creatively after automotive icons.

I was particularly impressed by the A1 Burger, a succulent blend of flavors where the patty was cooked to perfection and the A1-infused mayo added an unexpected zing that elevated the entire ensemble. The commitment to freshness was evident in the crispy lettuce and juicy tomato that accompanied it. Beyond the burgers, the crafted beer selection was an adventure in itself, featuring local artisan brews that perfectly complemented the meal.

"Tucked away in the heart of Philadelphia, Tria Cafe Wash West offers an intimate enclave for wine enthusiasts and food lovers alike. From the moment we stepped inside, the warm ambiance set the stage for what would be a delightful evening.

We began our culinary voyage with a selection of Snacks, with the standout being the truffled egg toast, a lush, decadent bite that paired sumptuously with our chosen vintages. Following this, the truffled mushroom bruschetta was a symphony of earthy flavors, with the fontina cheese adding a creamy undercurrent that left us eager for more.

I appreciated the thoughtful organization of Tria Cafe's menu. The categories, such as stinky and luscious cheeses or zippy and smooth whites in the wine selection, catered to connoisseurs and novices alike, demystifying the often-intimidating process of pairing.

Among the cheese offerings, the gouda with fig jam proved to be a rich encounter - dense, creamy, and perfect for indulging. However, the portion was quite generous, leading to the rare occurrence of leftovers that we sadly couldn't manage, the only minor detraction from an otherwise stellar experience.

For a lighter counterpoint, the smoked duck and spinach salad was a refreshing crescendo. The unique combination of dried cherries, pistachios, and citrus-mint vinaigrette complemented the smokiness of the duck beautifully, making for an unforgettable salad experience.

Service at Tria Cafe Wash West deserves commendation. Our server was a beacon of knowledge, guiding our selections and crafting for us what felt like a customized four-course journey through their menu, all while allowing our table to enjoy our conversation undisturbed.

I've docked one star simply for the slight overabundance of the rich cheese course, but beyond this, Tria Cafe Wash West earns a glowing 4-star review.

The attentive and friendly staff made my experience even more enjoyable, taking excellent care of me as I sat at the bar.

In fact, I was so impressed with my first visit that I decided to return multiple times, each time receiving the same outstanding service and delectable dishes.

However, I must note a slight disappointment during my fourth visit on May 25th. It was my girlfriend's birthday, and I had informed the restaurant of this special occasion. Unfortunately, they did not acknowledge her birthday in any way, not even offering a complimentary dessert. While the service was still good, the seafood tower fell short of my expectations. The king crab legs and lobster were disappointingly small and dry compared to the previous times I had ordered it. Considering the high price tag of $100, I expected a more satisfying experience.

Overall, Charro del Rey earns a solid four stars from me.

From the moment we stepped through the doors, the ambiance was a flawless blend of sophistication and comfort. The lighting was tastefully subtle, complementing the chic décor while the soft undertones of jazz added a touch of class. It set the stage for a memorable evening.

We started with the appetizers; the Lobster Bisque was a creamy delight, rich in flavors, topped with a delicate puff pastry. The Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli, with its bold yet balanced notes, was a revelation. For the main course, the Blackened Snapper was an impeccable choice, its crispy skin giving way to the succulent flesh, paired beautifully with a sweet corn spoon bread.

The Chilean Sea Bass, however, was the star of the night. Cooked to perfection, it flaked at the touch of the fork, and the champagne truffle sauce was an indulgence that added a luxurious depth to the dish. Accompanying the main dishes was a side of truffle mac and cheese that was the perfect marriage of comfort and decadence.

"As a coffee aficionado, Cajé Coffee Roasters seemed promising, yet my visit culminated in a mere 2-star experience. When it comes to coffee shops, atmosphere, service, and quality of offerings are paramount. Sadly, Cajé fell short on several fronts.

Upon entering, the ambiance was somewhat disrupted by an eclectic mix of music that was, to my dismay, jarringly loud, making it difficult to relax or converse. The seating arrangement was cramped, and comfort seemed to be an afterthought.

Customer service is the heart of the dining experience, and here too, Cajé Coffee Roasters stumbled. The staff, while not overtly rude, appeared disinterested and disengaged, diminishing what could have been a warm encounter. An absent smile or a simple greeting can sometimes make all the difference, and unfortunately, these were missing in action.

The cornerstone of any coffee establishment is its brew, and while the selection was ample, the execution was underwhelming. My cappuccino lacked the richness and balance that I had anticipated. The foam to espresso ratio was off, leading to a lackluster taste and an overall disappointing cup.

In the realm of food, the pastries seemed enticing, but their taste did not match their visual appeal. The croissant, which should be light and flaky, was dense and chewy. A clear disconnect between quality and presentation.

I ordered the salmon BBQ on white rice with the yellow lentil daal , which the help explained you dip the naan bread into. I enjoyed the salmon as it was expertly prepared and I truly liked everything I tried.  The yellow lentil dish is a nice mild mellow flavor. I was a little concerned about trying Choolaah because I don't care for curry, but I enjoyed my selections immensely.  They offer wheat or regular naan. It's cooked right there over a fire pit and it's worth going to Choolaah to try the Naan. 

There is a sauce/condiment area that offers different accompaniments to compliment your entree complete with suggestion. I loved the mango sauce and it complimented the salmon beautifully. The condiment area was clean and orderly too. There was an interesting mint yogurt sauce but I did not try it.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Another unpretentious place with good food and great beer. I'm noticing a trend here...

Went here with a coupon on a Saturday night (Yay Entertainment Book), and found another local favorite. Great beer menu  (reminiscent of a CA wine list with brewery location, alcohol content and detailed descriptions)..... a very cool atmosphere (it used to be the stable for the Lemp Brewery back in the day), and good food. The bacon-wrapped dates were surprisingly tasty; the rum-glazed chicken was delicious. The veggies? Not so healthy (made with more bacon... but hey, at least we didn't order the 'basket of bacon' appetizer off the menu)... nor were the mashed potatoes, I'm sure, but they were tasty, too. My husband ordered a ""PLATE OF FOOD"" off the menu (seriously... you pay 9 bucks, and get whatever the chef feels like giving you. We had to give it a shot.) He ended up with corned beef and cabbage (that thankfully tasted fresh and not like the chef was just trying to offload his leftover meat). Portions were decent, prices were good (though some of the beers were a bit steep for St. Louis, despite the selection)... and we're convinced (and we've heard) the place is haunted (seriously- check out the upstairs, especially if the lights are off. CREEPY!)",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At J. Christophers, I anticipated a delightful breakfast experience but was met with disappointment. The ambiance was generic, lacking character, and the seating felt cramped. Service was slow; it seemed understaffed, and my coffee cup stayed empty too long. The menu promised eclectic brunch options, yet the food quality didn't live up to the hype. I tried the signature pancakes—unfortunately, they were doughy and undercooked. The eggs Benedict had overpoached eggs and a hollandaise sauce that was bland and tepid. The side of hash browns appeared promising but was greasy and excessively salty. The prices didn't match the mediocrity of the dishes, making the meal underwhelming for the cost. While the servers remained polite, their inattentiveness could not be overlooked. Overall, J. Christophers didn’t meet expectations set by its menu and price point, suggesting a need for significant improvements in both kitchen and service.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"This restaurant is located in an unassuming strip of stores along Bethlehem Pike in Spring House right across from Rich's deli.  When you enter the restaurant the pizza / takeout area is to your left and there is a door that leads into the dining area.  

We had called ahead and gave them our name but they do not take reservations.  They have a call ahead list so if there is a wait they will put you at the front of the line.  We were seated quickly at a table in the middle of the dining area to the rear.  The decor was really nice and it didn't resemble the run of the mill strip mall pizza restaurant.  They have beams below the drop ceiling that mimic an arbor and it really gives the interior a nice Italian vibe.

After we sat down our water glasses were filled and soon after our waitress came over.  The service during our entire meal was very attentive.  My water glass never got below the half way mark before it was refilled.  

I ordered the stuffed hot pepper appetizer and my wife had the Mussels in a white wine broth I believe.  The peppers were bright green and the sausage stuffing was very good.  If you don't like really hot stuff this app is not for you.  I would give it a solid B+ while the mussels on the other hand C- borderline D.  The mussels were very small, chewy and the broth tasted almost only of lemon juice.  I wouldn't order these again.

Our dinner entrees were grilled Salmon and a Bolognese sauce in over homemade fettuccine noodles. My wife really enjoyed the Salmon and took half home for lunch the next day.  I really enjoyed the sauce and the pasta was pretty good.  I wouldn't say fantastic as other home made pasta but I would order it again.

Since this restaurant has so many great reviews I will be back to try it again.  We left feeling we spent a good amount of money for a BYO and didn't get the quality we had heard about.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I was surprised to see all the negative reviews here - I had a great experience. We rolled in at about 8:30 on a Sunday (they close at 9pm that night, and we were one of two tables in the restaurant) and got a nice spot outside. Our server was attentive without being a nuisance, and was friendly and congenial. And he didn't balk at us asking him to split the check w/three credit cards and cash, annoying though we were. 

I love the ambiance - you'd never guess there was such a cute courtyard out back just looking at the place. And I'm a fan of the water in old wine bottles instead of having to ask for refills. 

We shared the traditional antipasto which was a little light on the cured meats but included artichokes, roasted red peppers, pepperoni, cheeses, some other meats and olives. Very yummy. I got the roasted veggie pizza, which had a little more edge-crust than I usually prefer, but it was still pretty good. My friend ordered the shrimp and scallop pizza (which also came topped with bacon) - couldn't really taste the scallops but anything + bacon = kind of awesome in my book, and the slice I stole was tasty. 

All in all a pretty solid evening. I'll be back.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"4.5 stars! 

Overall, really great experience at Bemiston. From the friendly greetings when we first walked in, to the delicious food and drink items, it was all top notch. 

I enjoyed a delicious gin cocktail, while my husband enjoyed a very cheap shot and beer combo, and we also got the chili dog (my favorite part of my experience). The cocktails were clearly very well-made, with thoughtful garnishes, and the chili dog was a fabulous combo of flavors, including Hawaiian role buns, rich and smokey chili, and a mustard/onion combo on top. It was filling and satisfying. 

The aesthetic was cute, cozy, and comfy- particularly in the green lounge couches, perfect for parties of 4-6! They also had market lights to make it a true millennial retreat. 

The reason I didn't give this a 5 star was simply because of the limited number of options. I reallllllyy respect and appreciate that they do what they do well, but having something for everyone just is not a slam dunk here. So, just keep that in mind. 

Great addition to the Clayton family of restaurants! Pass on the word, because it is not a place you can easily see from the street.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Super fun way to spend your Saturday! We dropped by after lunch down the street and the place was packed. THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS FOR 21 YEARS OF AGE AND UP (they check your ID at the door). When you walk in there are tables to drinks/relax at and a huge bar in the middle. All of the arcade games are lining the walls around the bar and there's a ramp at the back of the room that leads to more games and the pinball machines. Almost every game is free with the exception of the pinball machines (which is a bummer because those are my favorite). There are tables in between most machines to rest your drink/bag on and everyone seemed to be very respectful of other players wanting to play the games so no one hogged any games. It would easy to spend a couple of hours here between getting drinks and playing games so plan accordingly!,HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Bigelo's Bistro is a hidden gem in the heart of the city. From the moment I stepped inside, I knew I was in for a memorable dining experience. The ambiance is warm and charming, with soft lighting and comfortable seating that creates an inviting atmosphere.

The menu at Bigelo's Bistro is truly a feast for the senses. With a focus on fresh, locally sourced ingredients, every dish is crafted with love and passion. The variety of options caters to different tastes, from vegan and vegetarian to meat lovers. The menu is diverse and thoughtfully designed, with an array of appetizers, entrees, and desserts that showcase the chef's creativity and skill.

The service at Bigelo's Bistro is exceptional. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, ensuring that every detail is taken care of and making you feel welcomed. They are happy to recommend dishes based on your preferences and dietary restrictions, and go above and beyond to accommodate any special requests.

Now, onto the food itself. Each dish I tried was a masterpiece. For starters, the truffle fries were perfectly crispy, with a hint of truffle oil that added a delightful earthy flavor. The goat cheese and beet salad was a refreshing combination of flavors, with the creamy goat cheese balancing out the sweetness of the beets.

For the main course, I indulged in the beef tenderloin, cooked to perfection and incredibly tender. It was served with a rich red wine reduction that enhanced the flavor of the meat beautifully. The side of roasted vegetables was cooked to perfection, and the flavors were so fresh and vibrant.

To end the evening on a sweet note, I ordered the chocolate lava cake. It was a decadent delight, with a gooey center that oozed out as soon as I dug my fork into it. The accompanying scoop of vanilla ice cream was the perfect accompaniment.

Overall, my experience at Bigelo's Bistro was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of delicious food, attentive service, and cozy ambiance made it a dining experience to remember.

"Nestled in the heart of Nashville, the Johnny Cash Museum offers a unique symphony of culinary experiences coupled with an evocative stroll through the Man in Black's life. The fusion of history, culture, and dining not only tantalizes the taste buds but also satiates the soul. With each bite of their Southern-inspired dishes, you can taste the rich homage to Cash's heritage.

The restaurant ambiance, much like Cash's music, is warm and inviting with a rustic undertone. Every wall adorned with memorabilia, each artifact feels like a personal note from Johnny himself, creating an intimate experience. The menu isn't extensive but thoughtfully crafted, each dish singing its own ode to Cash's journey.

I started with the ""Ring of Fire"" hot wings which were delectably spicy, setting the stage for a flavorful symphony. The ""Folsom Prison"" BBQ burger was succulent and cooked to perfection; each bite was a harmonious blend of smoky flavors and fresh ingredients.

The service was attentive without being overbearing, the staff members were knowledgeable about the museum pieces which enhanced the overall experience. I appreciated the interactive exhibits that allowed visitors to engage with Johnny Cash’s life and career intimately. However, the dining area can get a bit loud, which at times, disrupted the otherwise tranquil culinary soundtrack.

To cap off the experience, the gift shop offered unique memorabilia that fans of the Man in Black would treasure deeply. While there were minor hiccups—like the slightly cramped seating and the wait times during peak hours—the delicious food, rich history, and heartfelt tributes to an iconic legend made my time at the Johnny Cash Museum memorable. A solid four-star celebration of a country music titan.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Cucina Zapata offers an intriguing culinary blend that piqued my interest, but my visit left me with mixed feelings, leading to a 3-star review. Upon arrival, the atmosphere of the restaurant was vibrant and promising, although the seating arrangement felt a touch cramped. The staff were courteous but seemed overwhelmed by the bustling environment, causing a delay in service.

The menu was diverse and creatively fused various cuisines, and I was particularly tempted by the much-talked-about short rib tacos. When the dish arrived, the presentation was appetizing, and the combination of flavors initially seemed exceptional, with the spicy mayo offering a pleasant kick that complemented the ribs. However, the meat was slightly on the tougher side, detracting from the overall enjoyment.

Next, I sampled the tilapia burrito - the spicy version was delightful, with a generous portion and balanced flavors, but the non-spicy counterpart was notably bland, reminding me that consistency is key to a repeat customer's heart.

Finally, the satay chicken was a letdown. The overpowering curry flavor masked the nuances of the dish, leaving little room for the other ingredients to shine. It reinforced the notion that a perfect harmony of spices is crucial in dishes that boast bold flavors.

In conclusion, Cucina Zapata has the potential for a great dining experience with a few adjustments in consistency and balance. It's a place I might revisit, hoping for a refinement of the dishes that could elevate the overall experience to the buzzing promise it initially presents.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Embarking on a cookie-centric adventure, I found myself at Crumbl Cookies - Keystone Shoppes. With its pink branding and open-kitchen concept, the ambience immediately immerses visitors in a whimsical bakery milieu. Crowds were evident, a testament to Crumbl's burgeoning popularity, yet the efficient service managed the flow well. Patience is a virtue here, as I found the in-store wait slightly longer than anticipated, suggesting that next time, I'll partake in their convenient pre-order service.

The stars of the show were, unequivocally, the cookies themselves. Each one was substantial in size, a chunky delight that promises indulgence in every bite. The texture was a marvelous balance between a soft center and a slightly crisp edge. With a rotating menu of flavors, boredom is not an option for your taste buds. My personal favorites were the warm chocolate chip and a unique, seasonal flavor that invoked nostalgia and culinary curiosity simultaneously.

While price points inch towards the premium side and the cookie's richness can slightly overwhelm, indulging in moderation is key to the Crumbl experience. Packaging added a boutique touch, ensuring that even takeaway orders felt special—ideal for gifting or the occasional treat.

A 4-star verdict is rewarded to Crumbl Cookies - Keystone Shoppes, for turning the humble cookie into a gourmet experience. It’s a place that almost hits the sweet spot in every category, faltering only due to wait times and a tad high price point. Cookie aficionados and curious newcomers alike will find their curiosity rewarded and their sweet tooth satisfyingly indulged.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

To be fair I did get the Bailey's rice krispie treat with my mac once (yes, because it had Bailey's), but it was rather disappointing. No hint of Bailey's whatsoever and also it tasted quite stale, which left me quite sad.

"At Barra Rossa Ristorante, nestled in a cozy urban setting, I anticipated an Italian feast that would transport me straight to the heart of Tuscany. The ambience was inviting, with warm lighting and rustic decor, creating a charming backdrop for our meal. 

We were greeted with courteous but not particularly memorable service; efficient, yet lacking that personal touch which distinguishes a good dining experience from a great one. Our server fulfilled our requests without delay, yet didn't make any efforts to elevate our evening beyond the functional. 

The menu, an array of classic Italian dishes, promised rich flavors and heartwarming comfort food. I opted for the Caprese salad to start, followed by the Risotto ai Funghi. The salad was fresh, though conventional, with ripe tomatoes and a generous helping of mozzarella. 

The risotto, creamy with a tangible umami character from the mushrooms, was a highlight, albeit slightly over-seasoned, detracting from the dish's natural flavors. My dining partner's pasta, however, was overcooked with a somewhat uninspired sauce, leaving us wanting.

For dessert, we shared a Tiramisu that sadly didn't hit the sweet spot – while it had the right creamy texture, the coffee flavor was too timid to make a lasting impression. 

Barra Rossa Ristorante offered a competent but uneven experience. With a few adjustments to dish execution and service warmth, it has the potential to shine brighter. Thus, I settled on a fair three-star rating.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The crust is hit or miss as I have come back on other occasions where it was thicker consistency. The taro bubble tea is made with REAL TARO which is awesome! I have never had that and some people may not like the texture of real taro, but it's good! Also tried some of the combination buns with meat and other odds and ends (available in a display on the counter) and those were just alright (def better elsewhere). The pineapple buns with custard inside are a good option here as well. The prices are good if not comparable to the other bakeries. Possibly even cheaper? by like 10 cents.

First, I don't like beans in my chili. Ill take responsibility for that fact, and recognize the fact that their chili has beans means that Im really not going to be that into it. I tried both the hot and regular, and as with others recommendations, Id say go with the hot. I wish instead of hot vs regular, they had only hot with and without beans, but alas, no.

The burgers are so so. Very thin patties that essentially leave you with a burger of no greater quality than McDonalds dollar menu. The fries were pretty good, but super greasy. Im ok with that, but they dont last very long that way. And of course the hot dogs...well, nothing all that special. Nothing I couldn't make on my own.

"At first glance, Mike's York Street Bar & Grill doesn't strike as anything out of the ordinary—but I was pleasantly surprised by the robust flavors and attentive service that elevated the evening above the average diner & bar experience, hence my 4-star rating.

Upon entry, the ambiance is immediately warm and welcoming. It feels like the kind of local joint where everyone might just know your name. The lighting is just right, not too dim nor too glaring, striking a cozy balance ideal for both casual diners and sports enthusiasts eagerly watching games at the bar.

The menu is extensive, with selections ranging from classic bar bites to hearty entrees that offer a little something for everyone. I started with their famed spicy buffalo wings—a must-try for any wing aficionado. Perfectly cooked with a tantalizing sauce that hits the right notes of tangy and hot, they set the bar high for the rest of the meal.

Main courses like mine, a hand-pressed burger with all the fixings on a toasted brioche bun, deliver satisfaction in a way that meets the craving for traditional American comfort food. The sides merit a mention, too—the fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, a simple yet often unattainable feat for many establishments.

Service was on point throughout the evening. The waitstaff was attentive without being overbearing, striking a delicate balance that allowed for a relaxed dining experience. Drinks were refilled promptly, and our orders were taken and served with a smile.

Overall, Mike's York Street Bar & Grill may not reinvent the culinary wheel, but it serves up solid fare with a sense of heart. I left already pondering my next visit—perhaps to delve into their selection of craft beers or to sample another of their enticing mains.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Restaurant Name: Saffron Cafe
Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

Review:

I recently visited Saffron Cafe for dinner and unfortunately, I had a very disappointing experience. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere felt dull and uninviting. The dim lighting did not create a warm and cozy ambiance that I typically look for in a restaurant.

To start off, I ordered the hummus appetizer plate. I must admit, the hummus itself was quite creamy and luscious, which I appreciated. However, the portion size was incredibly small, leaving me wanting more. The warm pita bread served alongside was the saving grace of the dish as it was fresh and delicious.

Moving on to the main course, I decided to try the tilapia tajine. Unfortunately, this dish did not live up to my expectations either. Firstly, I had requested a side of saffron rice, which never arrived. This lack of attention to detail was a disappointment. The tilapia itself was cooked well and tender, but the flavors were lacking. The dish felt bland and uninspired. I was truly hoping for a burst of Moroccan spices and flavors but was sorely disappointed.

The service at Saffron Cafe was another disappointment. The staff seemed disinterested and inattentive, making it difficult to flag them down when I needed assistance. The overall lack of professionalism and hospitality only added to my overall dissatisfaction.

Lastly, the prices at Saffron Cafe were exorbitant for the quality of food and service provided. I did not feel that the experience justified the high price tag.

All in all, I cannot recommend Saffron Cafe based on my experience. The lackluster atmosphere, underwhelming dishes, and poor service left much to be desired. I will not be returning to this establishment in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

It's not unusual that once every month or so, around 9p at night, my husband gets a craving for this place. And that's exactly what happened the other night. We hadn't eaten much of a dinner and I'm always up for a burger, so I agreed! 

I decided to go with a double, which was definitely more than enough food when you're also splitting a large fry. I loved the fact that I could get my burger lettuce-wrapped and that I could get the single most important burger topping: bacon. The burger was juicy and delicious! The fries we got cajun style. The seasoning is awesome enough that you don't need ketchup or any other kind of dip!

They use peanut oil for their fries. I can't say I'm a fan of peanut oil, but I'm not really a fan of vegetable oil, either. So what's the difference, really?

"I recently had the pleasure of attending the Fountain Square Music Festival and I must say, it was an incredible experience. As an avid music lover, I was thrilled to find a restaurant that not only offers delicious food but also live music. The atmosphere was electric, and the vibes were contagious.

The moment I stepped inside, I knew I was in for a treat. The décor was trendy, with a mix of vintage and modern elements that added to the overall ambiance. The seating arrangement was comfortable, and there was plenty of space to move around and mingle with other patrons.

The highlight of my evening was, without a doubt, the live music. The stage was set up perfectly, allowing all guests to have a clear view of the performers. The lineup was diverse, with both emerging artists and well-known bands taking the stage. The sound quality was exceptional, and I could feel the music resonating through every fiber of my being. It was truly a feast for the senses.

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu at Fountain Square Music Festival is extensive, offering a variety of options to suit all tastes. From burgers to tacos to vegetarian dishes, there was something for everyone. I opted for the burger, and it did not disappoint. The patty was perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful. The toppings were fresh and complemented the burger well. The fries that accompanied the burger were crispy and addictive. The menu also boasts a wide selection of craft beers and cocktails, which added to the overall enjoyment of the evening.

The service at Fountain Square Music Festival was friendly and efficient. The staff seemed genuinely passionate about music and the overall experience they were providing.

The only reason I deducted a star from my rating is that, during peak hours, it did get a bit crowded, and the wait times for both a table and food were longer than expected.

"Upon my recent visit to Ocean City, I was utterly captivated. From the moment I stepped through its doors, I was greeted by a harmonious symphony of oceanic charm and culinary brilliance.

The ambiance was a seamless blend of elegance and serenity, reminiscent of a gentle sea breeze. Oceanic motifs and soft, flowing décor were complemented by the inviting glow of ambient lighting, perfectly setting the stage for what was to be an unforgettable dining experience.

Our culinary journey commenced with their signature appetizer, a medley of fresh, succulent oysters whose flavors spoke of the sea's bounty. Delicately dressed with a tangy mignonette, each oyster was a delightful prelude to the symphony of tastes that followed.

The main affair was an exquisite display of skill and finesse. The Pan-seared Scallops with a hint of vanilla-infused butter melted harmoniously on the palate, while the Seared Tuna Steak, encrusted with a blend of vibrant spices, was the epitome of delicate precision.

No sea-themed experience would be complete without a proper tribute to the treasures of the deep, and Ocean City's Lobster Thermidor was a dish fit for Neptune himself. Bathed in a rich, creamy sauce and presented with an artisan's touch, it captured the essence of the ocean's depth in each bite.

Their dessert, a Coconut Panna Cotta with mango coulis, was a dreamy end to a meal that sailed beyond my highest expectations.

Accompanied by impeccable service and a curated selection of fine wines that complemented every dish, Ocean City secured its place as not just a meal, but a five-star maritime odyssey. The serenade of flavors, the choreography of presentation, and the aura of the place have left an indelible mark on my palate.

"Vintage Wine Bar is a fantastic place to unwind and enjoy some good wine. The ambiance is trendy yet cozy, perfect for a date or a small gathering. The bartender was friendly and provided great service. I had a glass of delicious cabernet along with a fantastic romaine hearts salad and bouillabaisse. The salad, in particular, was outstanding with its combination of walnuts and goat cheese. I can't wait to return and try more dishes from their menu.

"Love this place! She put out a promo for try your first class free which I took advantage of. I tried the burn/build class which was awesome. It was a new fun way to do the same type of workout I would at a gym class with the added difficulty of the boards. I felt a great burn mostly in the legs and core but wasn't so sore I couldn't function the next day. I came back with my boyfriend a week later and he really enjoyed it. His legs are stronger than mine but he loved the core aspect and cardio.
The studio was easy to find but if you're coming from the west on 51st you have to drop down a block early to take the left around the median to access it. And watch for potholes in the parking lot. You enter the studio through what looks like the entrance to a spa but take a right as soon as you enter with the little wave sign. Its a beautiful space with open cubbies for your things and changing stalls. Only one bathroom. The studio has only 8 boards so the classes are smaller. you can book your board easily online to reserve your spot. But make sure you're going or there is a no show fee. Natasha is great. She has so much energy and encouragement during her classes. She always offers different modifications for all the moves if they are too difficult. I would encourage everyone to try this out. Me and the boyfriend are going to sign up for the two week intro for $40 to try all the classes and I will hopefully be making this a weekly routine.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"i ate here years ago, and it was awesome. then, i ate here in may, and it was...well, decent. i ordered a meaty sandwich with pastrami and brisket and provolone, and it was pretty good, but not as amazing as i remember.  i mean, if i had never eaten here before and known the incredibleness it was, then i'd give it a 4-star, but, since it just didn't shine like it had before, i'm giving it 3. 
i'd definitely go here again, since there's so many awesome meaty sandwich combinations you can create, and matzo ball soup!!!!! they have matzo ball soup!!!!!  
go here, be adventurous in your meat-master sandwich combination you piece together, and also be laid back about the atmosphere and accommodations...it's a diner/deli. :)  cheers!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"You definitely get your money's worth here. Portions are large and in charge! They seriously don't kid around. I ordered a side of fries for my toddler and they gave us a whole to-go box filled to the brim! That one side would've fed our whole family of 5. I prefer the other location to this one which is why I gave this one 3 stars. They never give us condiments unless we ask. At different times we've ordered cheese sticks and mushrooms and both were very dry without some kind of dipping sauce. The mushrooms were definitely not the best I've ever had. When you take a bite, you get more of a mouthful of grease than actual mushroom. We usually have to repeat our order back several times before they get everything and we're not the type that just spits everything out in one long breath. Customer service is pretty sub-par. They're not rude but they're not very welcoming either. We normally order burgers when coming here but I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich trying to be somewhat healthy (it's kind of impossible here). My chicken was very dry and tough. The burgers are always pretty good though. All in all, I like Fat Mo's when craving a burger but will venture to the other location instead.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Dining at Sho Wok was an adventure for my taste buds, transporting me through an array of Asian-inspired flavors that were both familiar and intriguing. Upon entering, I immediately noticed the restaurant's cozy yet modern ambiance, with a hint of traditional Asian decor that set the stage for an authentic culinary journey.

Service at Sho Wok was commendable; the staff were attentive without being overbearing, offering up suggestions and insights into the menu's specialties. After perusing the menu, which offered a delightful mix of classic and contemporary dishes, I opted to start with the dim sum platter. Each piece was a delicate bite of joy, with careful attention to the balance of flavors and textures that are pivotal in such a dish.

The main course was a tough decision, but I finally settled on the Szechuan peppercorn beef — a dish that promised a spicy kick complemented by a medley of stir-fried vegetables. The beef was tender, succulent, and the heat level was satisfyingly intense without overshadowing the natural flavors of the ingredients. The vegetables retained a nice crunch, providing a good contrast to the soft beef.

I paired the meal with a glass of their house white wine, which was a pleasantly crisp complement to the spices of my entree. For a sweet ending, I couldn't resist the green tea ice cream. It was a refreshing palate cleanser, creamy with a subtle tea flavor that wasn't overpowering.

While mostly impressive, the experience had a few minor downsides. The rice served alongside my beef was a tad overcooked, losing the ideal texture one seeks in a perfect side of rice. Additionally, the noise level was a bit high, though this could be attributed to the restaurant's popularity and vibrant atmosphere.

In summary, Sho Wok earned a solid four-star rating. The culinary execution, ambiance, and service create an enjoyable dining experience—one that beckons for subsequent visits to further explore their menu. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned aficionado of Asian cuisine, Sho Wok offers enough variety to satisfy a wide range of palates.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill, and overall, it was a delightful experience. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was captivated by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The dim lighting, tasteful decorations, and comfortable seating created a cozy ambience that was perfect for a relaxed evening.

The service at Stoney River was exceptional. The waitstaff were attentive, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure my dining experience was memorable. They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions when I couldn't decide what to order. My water glass was never empty, and my food arrived promptly without feeling rushed.

As a steak lover, I had high hopes for the food at Stoney River, and I was not disappointed. The menu offered a variety of cuts and preparation options, and after much deliberation, I settled on a filet mignon cooked to medium-rare perfection. The steak was tender, flavorful, and cooked exactly to my liking. The accompanying sides, such as the garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus, complemented the steak beautifully, adding depth to each bite.

While the steak was undoubtedly the highlight of my meal, I was also impressed with the range of options for non-meat eaters. There were vegetarian and seafood dishes that looked equally enticing and received rave reviews from my dining companions. Stoney River truly caters to a diverse range of palates.

The only reason I deducted a star from my rating was the price. While the quality of the food and service was excellent, the prices were on the higher end. However, I believe that the experience warrants the cost, especially for a special occasion or when you're looking to treat yourself.

In conclusion, Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill is a restaurant that I would highly recommend. From the inviting atmosphere to the exceptional service and mouthwatering steaks, it is evident that the staff take pride in providing a memorable dining experience. If you're willing to splurge a bit, Stoney River will surely leave you satisfied and eager to return for another delicious meal.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"I really can't believe I've never been to this place until recently...wow was I missing out!! I made a reservation online and despite the place being packed, they honored my reservation and seated me right away- even accommodating my specific requests. The staff was like a well-oiled machine. I met at least 4 different people that jumped in to help deliver food/take drink orders but had a primary waiter who was also excellent with his customer service (so sorry I can't remember your name...). They even apologized for several different people coming over to help, but it wasn't even necessary since it was obvious they were all just working together helping each other out. I LOVE seeing that in a restaurant!! 

Now for the food...the best part. :) I started with some 'nibblers' so tested out the Saffron Arancini, whipped ricotta corn dip, and the salmon rillette. Honestly, they were all three incredible and I would order all three again any day. One of my favorite starters was the lamb meatballs- those cheese grits are soooo deliciously creamy!! I really respect a good grit since 9/10 places make crummy, watery grits. I also got the short rib pasta as my main entree and it was wonderful as well- made with fresh homemade pasta! For dessert, I ordered the white chocolate bread pudding since the waiter told me it'd change my life haha...and I mean, let's be real, it did. I would come here just for the bread pudding alone! It was a large dessert which was great because I could spend longer savoring every bite. P: YUM. 

For drinks...this place could make me broke. Seriously haha. Their cocktails all look amazing and their liquor menu is extensively tasteful. If you're looking for a good, tasty night out...I would definitely recommend making a reservation for On Swann. Can't wait to be back!!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Took the trip from the DDD segment and overall I'm glad I came by.  I tried several things; torta, tofu tostada and a side of Mexican rice. Also had the pineapple drink. First the torta. Good flavor but too much bun for me. I ended up eating just the bottom half of the sandwich so I probably didn't get the full taste of this one.  The tofu tostada was excellent.  Had you not ordered it, you would never guess its tofu.  Surely would try that again.  The mexican rice was not what I would expect from an authentic mexican spot so I would steer clear of that.  The pineapple drink was great and would surely recommend.  The staff is very friendly and do agree with some of the other reviews that there is a funky smell that comes from the outside area.  That can be fixed with better cleaning the soil/rocks around the tables and moving trash bins.  Sad I'd even have to comment but it's worth stating that you should eat inside.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

The dirty bench seating immediately turned me off and set a negative tone for the rest of the meal. Our server seemed disinterested and forgetful, leaving us feeling neglected. To add insult to injury, I witnessed another server cleaning a table and simply wiping the food onto the seating and floor. The lack of cleanliness was appalling. As for the food, the spicy pork lettuce wraps and tuna tataki were nothing special, while the steamed veggie potstickers were the only saving grace.

"My visit to Solebury Orchards was nothing short of disappointing. From the moment I walked in, the lack of ambiance was evident. The decor felt outdated, and the overall atmosphere was dull and uninspiring. 

Moving on to the service, it was lackluster at best. The staff seemed disinterested and had a nonchalant attitude towards the customers. It took forever for someone to acknowledge our presence and even then, the service was slow and inattentive. 

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu boasted of fresh, farm-to-table offerings, but the reality fell short. The dishes lacked creativity and were underwhelming in taste. The ingredients seemed ordinary, and there was no wow factor in any of the dishes. I ordered a salad that arrived with wilted greens and a dressing that lacked flavor. My dining companion opted for the main course, which was equally disappointing. The presentation was unappealing, and the dish was bland and poorly seasoned. 

To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant considering the quality of the food and service. We felt as if we were being overcharged for a subpar dining experience. 

The only saving grace of the restaurant was the beautiful location. Situated amidst orchards with stunning views, it was a lovely sight to behold. However, the view alone was not enough to compensate for the lackluster experience I had at Solebury Orchards. 

In conclusion, I would not recommend dining at Solebury Orchards. The uninspiring ambiance, lackluster service, mediocre food, and high prices make it an establishment that fails to impress. There are much better options available in the area, where you can enjoy a memorable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

I recently had breakfast at Waffle House and it was an amazing experience from start to finish. The restaurant had a cozy and welcoming atmosphere, and the staff were friendly and attentive throughout my meal. 

The service at Waffle House is top-notch. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and promptly seated. The waitress was efficient and took my order quickly. Despite the restaurant being busy, my food arrived at my table in a timely manner. 

Speaking of the food, it was absolutely delicious. I ordered their classic waffle with a side of crispy bacon, and both were cooked to perfection. The waffle was fluffy on the inside with a golden crispy exterior, and the bacon was just the right amount of crunchy. The portions were generous, and I left feeling satisfied and content. 

The coffee at Waffle House is also worth mentioning. It was piping hot and had a rich, bold flavor that woke me up instantly. The waitress made sure to top up my cup throughout the meal, which I appreciated.

"Giunta's is a newer butcher in Reading Terminal Market.  I'm still somewhat confused as to their ""organic"" claims, since it seems this is not at all the case.  Despite this, they have a good selection of beef, poultry, and some game.  The service is OK, but nothing that I'd call outstanding.  I've only had one issue there in 5 or so years, and that was a rack of lamb that turned out to be bad.  I did take it back and they exchanged it; I can't be too critical of that, since that kind of thing will happen occasionally.  The rack was vacuum-sealed (they have a machine onsite) and it wasn't evident from the outside that anything was wrong.  Not sure what the issue was, but it was a one-time occurrence.  

I circulate between this, and a few other butchers in the market, and truth be told I don't find a huge difference between them; it's more who has what.  The prices are usually very close.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

The restaurant had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with colorful décor that transported me to the vibrant streets of Mexico. The staff was friendly and welcoming, making me feel at home from the moment I walked in.

I started my meal with the classic guacamole and chips, which was fresh and packed with flavor. The menu offered a wide variety of Mexican dishes, and I opted for the enchiladas suizas.

Overall, I had a great experience at Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant and would highly recommend it to others looking for a tasty and authentic Mexican dining experience.

I walked in expecting a typical somewhat-grody diner atmosphere and was surprised with a very nice, clean & bright brand new interior with large, comfy booths. I don't mind grody atmosphere necessarily, in a diner - but it's nice to have your expectations exceeded! This place is downright NICE inside.

Every facet of my breakfast was TOP QUAL. Everything. The owner was like a majestic hawk, soaring all over the restaurant making sure things went perfectly. He even intercepted my girlfriend's single pancake *as it was on the way to our table*  and sent it back to the kitchen to be remade since it was ""too well done""! Apologies were issued by the waitress and a new cake was ""express delivered"" out post haste. 

The pancakes - INCREDIBLE. They melt in your mouth. Perfectly done, and you can tell the batter is homemade from the first bite. Served with fresh (soft) butter in a *dish* (not an impossible-to-open tiny, cheap plastic thingy), and HOT syrup (one of the things that tells me a diner knows it's business with pancakes).

The bacon - IMPRESSIVE to say the least. Bacon is another one of my gauges to determine a place's excellence. They serve ""thick cut country bacon"" here, not as an ""upgrade"" (ala Lenny's), it's ALL they serve. It is THE BEST bacon I have had in St Pete, period. And one of my hobbies is trying bacon at breakfast spots, so I consider myself a connoisseur.

The biscuits & gravy - DECENT! Not a highlight of my visit, and probably a 3.5 our of 5, just because they weren't very exciting. Not bad by any means, however.

The service - SPOT ON. Swift, friendly and accurate. I especially LOVE how they had up to three people working the registers as needed. At no time did a line build up at the register to check out like most places. As people stacked up there, they sent more staff to accommodate. Again, the owner directed his folks like the wise admiral of a battleship. SUPERB in every aspect.

One thing that stood out about Sushi-Cho is its reasonable prices. Compared to other sushi places in town, Sushi-Cho offers a great value for money. I also had the luck of visiting on New Year's Day when they had a sale, which made the meal even more enjoyable.

The service at Sushi-Cho was impressive, considering the crowd. The staff was attentive and the food arrived fairly quickly. Each meal came with edamame and miso soup, which were standard but enjoyable starters.

We ordered a variety of rolls and nigiri. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up with the nigiri as they sent scallops instead of the salmon we requested. However, they didn't charge us for either and the scallops turned out to be decent. Nonetheless, I was disappointed as I had a craving for salmon.

The specialty rolls at Sushi-Cho were massive. They were so big that it was almost impossible to eat them with chopsticks. We tried the Vegas roll, the spider roll, and the Red Dragon roll. The Red Dragon roll had a couple of pieces of cucumber that tasted bitter and rotten, which was disappointing. The Vegas and spider rolls were a bit bland but still enjoyable.

We also decided to try the blue crab roll based on a friend's recommendation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a letdown. The roll lacked flavor, and there was an overwhelming amount of rice, leaving little room for the fillings.

In conclusion, Sushi-Cho is a budget-friendly sushi restaurant offering decent food. While there were a few issues with our order, the overall experience was good. If you're looking for a wallet-friendly sushi spot, Sushi-Cho is worth a visit.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Avo is a fresh food fanatic's dream... The menu is filled to the margins with delicious vegan dishes, and the indoor-outdoor seating makes for a perfect ambience on a sunny day.

I would strongly recommend starting with a REBBL Maca Cold Brew and avocado toast. As for an entire, I really don't think you can go wrong...

If you're looking for a healthy break from Nashville's deep-fried hot chicken (which is also delicious, by the way), make your way to Avo!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"No question this place has some incredible rolls and sashimi.  Definitely the place you go for the creative and unorthodox (not for the same-old-same-old sushi).  

there are 200 items on the menu and I've only had the pleasure of 10 of them.  but as I return, I will expand this review (for now, anything with habanero sauce is to die for and the baked green lip mussels are killer...but be careful, they come in groups  of five so I hope you know how to share ""awesomeness"").

god bless my girlfriend for introducing me to this place.  can't wait to go back for the oysters (which, fyi, can run out if you get there too late!)",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"The scene from street-level at Mosaic seemed pretty cool, so I was excited to check it out on a recent business trip with a colleague. Having dined at another tapas locale (Mango) the night before, we were in a good mood to try a bunch of small plates. However, the service was not terribly helpful in suggesting an appropriate number of places for us to choose (""they're all different sizes"" is not a helpful answer.) Our server was terse in a number of other interactions, so that makes Mosaic only a 3. Also, some of the prices for the plates seemed off ($14 for 3 scallops just seems wrong...)",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Fried Chicken Sunday. 

Arrived here just as the doors opened, so it wasn't too bad. We had a big party. Myself, my parents, my sister and her husband, their two kids, and my 6 year old nephew. They took us upstairs and placed us in a room that was facing the street. Nice to see downtown Waterloo.  The room had a Christmas tree, even though it wasn't Christmas, but it was cool nonetheless. I do like how they converted an old house into a restaurant! They even had an elevator that my niece, nephew, and I took downstairs because we can. 

So much food. You get: family recipe fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits, cream gravy, corn custard & slow-cooked green beans with ham & a complimentary
dessert served family style. The corn custard was so good! The chicken was just right. For dessert, we had various cake options. My tummy was so full from all the food, I had no room for dessert, but stuffed my face anyway. 

Great food, great atmosphere, fun times had by all. Make your way over the bridge to Waterloo and see what all Gallagher's has to offer. You won't be disappointed.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Food was just ok for a place that has so much history and positive feedback. The best thing we had was the Irish coffee. Yeah yeah yeah (Mariah Carey voice). 

The thing that upset us the most was how pricey a side of grits was. Nearly $6! That's crazy.

On the happy side, everyone was welcoming and service was super. Nothing like southern hospitality (and expensive grits).",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"As I have mentioned in my first review, I love Obon. it really is my favorite restaurant in Tucson for a perfect meal, a one-of-a-kind cocktail & great service. But I have to admit, I was a left feeling a tad disappointed after my last stop here with a few friends that had never been here before. 

My bf & I brag about Obon religiously and recommend it to all our friends/family. We came here to have a celebratory dinner and were seated promptly at a table for 7. Unfortunately, we had two friends call to say they could make it after all and that they would like to join us for dinner. We had already been seated for about 45 minutes so when the waiter told us he couldn't accommodate two more, I wasn't surprised and understood because it was a crowded Friday night and they had a full house. Not to mention they didn't have to extra chairs to spare. 

This is what got me though. I ordered a 2nd cocktail and the waiter took over 20 minutes to bring it out. He not only spilled it on me, but all over my handbag. Do you think he had the decency to come back & clean the mess he made on the table? My drink sat in a puddle of spilled alcohol and he never bothered to come clean the mess he made or offer me anything to clean up my pants and handbag with. I get it, people make mistakes like this in the restaurant business but I think I wouldn't have even had bothered to get upset over it had the waiter cleaned up. 

 I feel like he had an attitude ever since we had asked if he could accommodate two more people and I was very disappointed because in about the 20+ times I have been to Obon, he made it our first and very unexpected bad experience there and left a bad taste in my mouth. With each couple at our table spending $60-$100+ each for their meal & drinks, I expected a friendlier server and better service as we had many other options downtown for dinner but chose to spend the money at Obon. Pretty disappointing.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"My experience at Dolce Carini was extremely disappointing. From the moment I walked in, I knew something was off. The restaurant was dimly lit, giving it a dull and uninviting ambiance. The hostess seemed uninterested and took forever to acknowledge my presence.

Once I was finally seated at my table, the service continued to be lackluster. It took an eternity for the waiter to come over and take my drink order, and even longer for the drinks to be delivered. Throughout the night, I had to constantly flag down the waiter just to get his attention. It was clear that customer service was not a priority here.

Now let's talk about the food. I ordered the pasta dish recommended by the waiter, expecting a delicious and authentic Italian meal. Unfortunately, the pasta was overcooked and lacked any flavor. It was as if they had forgotten to season it at all. The portion size was also quite small for the price I paid. I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and still hungry.

To make matters worse, the restaurant seemed understaffed. I observed other diners around me, and they too were waiting ages for their orders to arrive. The kitchen seemed to be in chaos, with orders getting mixed up and forgotten. It was a clear indication of a poorly managed establishment.

Aside from the poor service and mediocre food, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. The tables were sticky, and there were crumbs scattered on the floor. It was clear that the staff did not prioritize tidiness or cleanliness in the dining area.

In conclusion, my experience at Dolce Carini was nothing short of a disaster. The lack of attentive service, tasteless food, and dirty environment left a lasting negative impression. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality dining experience. There are numerous other establishments in the area that offer much better food and service.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Embarking on an edible journey at Cajun Encounters Tour Company was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment I arrived, the ambiance whisked me into the heart of Louisiana charm, complete with warm, rustic decor that felt both inviting and authentic. The menu, a delightful ode to Cajun cuisine, offered an array of dishes, each brimming with bold flavors and locally sourced ingredients. 

The standout was undoubtedly the gumbo—rich, savory, and with just the right kick of spice, it cozied up to the palate like a well-loved blanket on a breezy evening. The jambalaya, studded with Andouille sausage and succulent shrimp, was a close second, its layers of flavor harmonizing like a well-rehearsed jazz ensemble.

Service here was seamless and intuitive; the staff, with their genuine smiles and deep knowledge of the menu, made impeccable recommendations and ensured my water glass was never empty. Each course was served promptly, yet I never felt rushed—the mark of true hospitality.

In the landscape of dining experiences, Cajun Encounters Tour Company is a gem that gleams with culinary excellence and an unwavering commitment to authentic Southern hospitality. It not only met but exceeded my expectations in every way, securing a perfect five-star rating. Whether you're a local or a traveler, make sure to savor the experience that this restaurant has to offer.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"It took me less than a second to realize once I walked up the steps into Rush on Main that I was stepping on Chicago fan territory. If you're hoping to run into a Cubs fan, you're guaranteed not one but many here. 

I love the atmosphere. It's a true sports pub with a simple food menu but a lengthy beer and drink list. It seems like it's a place for regulars with a huge drink-share chalk board on an entire wall of the establishment. 

The hot dogs on the menu are no surprise, but their veggie burger is unexpectedly amazing. This is a place for appetizers during a ball game. You've got all the standards, and they all look amazing.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Not sure how much an impression a single iced coffee could have made, but I was looking forward to a decent cup of coffee after a couple days of hotel coffee during a conference.  I got a small 12oz glass filled to the brim of their bourbon coffee with a splash of almond coconut milk.  Maybe I should have gone with a latte or Americano instead...the cold brew coffee lacked the kind of coffee kick I needed.  Over $3 for the average tiny glass of coffee.  Simple syrup being made available for cold drinks is a plus.

I did like the vibe of the place...you would think the hipster blank stares would be intimidating but while not exactly welcomed, I felt very comfortable at Crema.

Small, and a chaotic looking tiny parking lot...I bravely walked past the homeless on benches to get here from my hotel next to the Music City convention center.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"From the moment I stepped into Bud & Marilyn's, I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance whisks you away to a retro-classic era that feels both nostalgic and exciting. The staff greeted us warmly, setting the stage for an impeccable dining experience.

Seated promptly, the menu tantalized with American classics, offering comfort food with a gourmet twist. After sipping on a beautifully crafted cocktail that balanced flavors expertly, our dishes began to arrive. I indulged in the fried chicken, its crispy exterior giving way to succulent meat that fell off the bone, accompanied by sides that complemented each bite perfectly.

My dining companions raved about their choices as well, from a hearty, flavor-packed meatloaf to a steak cooked to juicy perfection. Desserts were not an afterthought; the rich, homemade pie provided a sweet finale to an already outstanding meal.

Service throughout was attentive without being intrusive, and the pricing felt reasonable for the quality and portion sizes presented. Bud & Marilyn's weren't just a meal; it was a gastronomic journey wrapped in the warm embrace of exceptional hospitality. An easy five stars out of five, this is a dining experience I'm eager to repeat.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Sweet Jesus, this place is amazing. I'm not a huge breakfast fan, but this is the kind of place that I love: laidback, hip, artsy, and innovative with both sweet and savory on the menu; not your typical breakfast food. 

My partner, who frequently eats dessert for brunch raved about the cannoli french toast. I could eat the huevos rancheros every day. 

Service was friendly and helpful. We arrived at 10:15am on a Saturday and there was no wait. We left around noon and there were still plenty of tables available. 

The location is a bit off the beaten path. We cabbed it to and from. It appeared to be in the middle of an old warehouse district that is on the verge of redevelopment.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Every single star is for server Michael, and all residual starlight is just for the restaurant's ambience. 

Londoner Michael, our server, should start a hospitality school. Having managed several restaurants as a young, young woman, I wish I had him to train my front-of-the-house staff, and to train myself. I would have made a lot more money and maybe stayed in the industry because Michael reminds you that people can be bona fide fun. Any restaurant would be privileged to have him on staff. He is amicable, funny, and charming, and actually enjoys his job. He knows wine and could recommend what pairs with red meat and meaty fish, though my friend selected a Sauvignon Blanc, which would not by my go-to (it's fine - it was her night). For dessert, though we were the last straggling table at the wee hour of 10:30, he brought that same friend a surprise raspberry sorbet to honor her opening night in a play. 

The ambience is charming and classier - yet more eclectic, a difficult balance to strike, I think - than most comparably priced establishments I can think of in Tucson. The setting honors the Barrio Viejo while not being a Mexican cliché, and the flow matches the structural architecture. Entering the building is kind of like entering a wormhole: you go through a teeny tiny door and suddenly you're in a hypnotic library-like setting: Alice in Wonderland with the freedom to decide where to eat. The large twinkly patio is a good choice. It would be a nice place to have a party.

The food let us down though. Medium rare translates to medium well for both meat and fish, at least when you are the last table of the night. The menu is uninspired anyway, as far as I can tell. We didn't have much time to look at it. Even though I called to see when the kitchen closed (10 p.m.), and we arrived at about 9:20, we were rather rushed to order. Not ""rather."" We were RUSHED. 

The wine list is so-so. 

I would like to have been more impressed by the rest of the usual experience - you know, food, wine ... but it is the service that does it. No report for ya on the bathroom.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

My daughter and I visited Westfield for the USAG Regional Championships and we stayed in Carmel. Next day, after check out, we decided to go here and check it out.

It's not bad, but it did not change my life. There are some interesting place, stores and small galleries. A couple of interesting restaurants and coffee shops. Maybe 1-2 bars.

We went up and down the whole street at least twice in no more than 90 mins. We went into, at least, 7 stores and browsed things, bought a couple of things. An interesting olive oil store, a t-shirt store with a Stranger Things design. Some very realistic statues all over the place. A $10/pop Miniature Home Museum.

Not a bad experience, but neither life-changing. If you have some time to kill, go check it out, why not.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Bulldog, and let me tell you, it was an absolute delight! From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional, and I can confidently say that it is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.

First of all, the atmosphere at The Bulldog was warm and inviting. The sleek and modern decor created a cozy yet chic ambiance, making you feel right at home as soon as you stepped through the doors. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, providing top-notch service throughout the entire meal.

Now, let's talk about the food. Oh my goodness, the food! The menu at The Bulldog is a culinary delight, with an extensive array of mouthwatering dishes to choose from. The ingredients were clearly of the highest quality, and each dish was beautifully presented. I opted for the steak frites, and let me tell you, it was cooked to perfection. The steak was tender and juicy, and the fries were crispy and flavorful. It was a true feast for the senses.

To accompany the delicious food, The Bulldog also has an impressive selection of wines and cocktails. I decided to try their signature cocktail, The Bulldog Mule, and it was simply divine. The drink was expertly crafted, with the perfect balance of flavors, and it paired wonderfully with the meal.

Overall, my experience at The Bulldog was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of impeccable service, delectable food, and fantastic atmosphere truly made it a memorable dining experience. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough, and I will definitely be returning again soon. Five stars out of five - well-deserved, without a doubt.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Finney's  for take out. There it is. It's crazy times so like most were doing take out a lot more than usual. After trying many places, with varying results we really found a spot that just nails it for our two different tastes. (take out is a very different animal than dine in we've learned) :-o. Looking for a portable meal for a picnic lunch near the waterfront, I opted for the Finney's BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Slow roasted pork, house-made bbq, crispy onions, corn on a brioche bun. I really appreciate what I call the ""modern"" or ""West Coast"" style pulled pork sandwich that uses crispy onions, sometimes cheese, but eschews any other sauces (mayo, special sauce) and does NOT feature cole-slaw (though there was a small tub of it to add for the traditionalist :-). Eating the sandwich from the to-go tub was actually a blessing as they didn't skimp on the BBQ sauce and brioche bun really soaked it up, the knife & fork pack was a welcome addition :-) The addition of corn on the sandwich was an interesting add and, for me good addition but YMMV on that one. My wife, on the other hand opted for the Asian Ahi Salad : Mixed greens, seared Ahi, mandarin oranges, carrots, peppers, pea sprouts, onions, tofu, cucumber, basil, ginger miso vinaigrette. OMG she raved about this one, cleaning out every scrap of the decent sized to-go container. Ahi was great, miso dressing was excellent and even the tofu garnered praise! We both swore we'd go back for the same things next time for sure. We've found our to go joint in downtown SB for sure :-)",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Firstly, the service was atrocious - the waitstaff seemed indifferent and inattentive to our needs. Our order took an eternity to arrive, and when it did, the food was cold and tasteless. The presentation lacked any sort of creativity, as if no effort was put into it at all. The menu boasted of unique and flavorful dishes, but the reality was far from that. The flavors were bland, and the dishes lacked any complexity. It seemed as if the chef drastically underestimated the importance of seasoning. Additionally, the portion sizes were incredibly small, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and as if we had wasted our money. The ambiance was nothing to write home about either - the decor was bland and outdated, and the seating was uncomfortable.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Nudy's Café in West Chester and I must say, it was an exceptional experience that deserves a 5-star rating. From the moment I walked in, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel right at home.

I started off with their famous crab bisque as an appetizer, and it was absolutely heavenly. The soup was rich and creamy, with generous chunks of tender crab meat. It was the perfect way to warm up on a chilly evening.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken piccata and it was simply outstanding. The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection, topped with a delicious lemon butter sauce that had the right balance of tanginess and richness. The accompanying pasta was cooked al dente, and the flavors worked together harmoniously.

What impressed me the most about Nudy's Café was their commitment to using fresh, high-quality ingredients. It was evident in every bite. The menu offered a variety of options, from seafood to steaks, and even vegetarian dishes, ensuring there is something for everyone.

The service throughout my meal was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and eager to accommodate any special requests. It was evident that the entire team took pride in their work and genuinely cared about ensuring a memorable dining experience.

To end my meal on a sweet note, I indulged in their homemade chocolate lava cake. The warm, gooey center paired perfectly with the rich chocolate flavor, and it was the ultimate indulgence to cap off an already delightful meal.

"My visit to Golden Flower Vietnamese was a journey of highs and lows. The ambiance, cozy with traditional decor, promised an authentic experience. A glance at the menu revealed a variety of classic Vietnamese dishes to choose from. 

I settled on their Pho, which boasted a rich but somewhat unbalanced broth. The noodles, while plentiful, tended to clump, and the beef was tender but lacked the seasoning punch I was craving. The summer rolls, however, were fresh and became the highlight with their crisp vegetables and perfect dipping sauce.

Service was a mixed bag, too. Initially greeting us with warmth, our server vanished post-order, leaving us without the usual attentive follow-up. Water refills and check-ins would have elevated the experience.

Golden Flower can sate a Vietnamese food itch, but it's not a culinary revelation. It's a solid enough choice for a casual dinner, yet leaves room for improvement in both flavor finesse and service consistency.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The restaurant had a cozy and rustic atmosphere, with warm lighting and wooden accents that created a welcoming ambiance. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed throughout our meal.

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu at The Cider Press offered a great selection of dishes, with a focus on farm-to-table ingredients. The freshness of the ingredients really shone through in each dish we tried. We started with the cider-infused mussels, which were cooked to perfection and packed with flavor. The cider added a unique twist that elevated the dish.

For the main course, I opted for the cider-glazed pork chop, and it did not disappoint. The meat was tender and juicy, with a delicious glaze that had just the right amount of sweetness. The accompanying roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection and added a nice balance to the dish. My partner had the mushroom risotto, which was rich and creamy, with a generous amount of perfectly cooked mushrooms.

My only small disappointment was the dessert selection. While the options were tasty, I felt that they were a bit limited. The apple tart we had was delicious, but I would have loved to see a few more unique and creative options on the menu.

The Cider Press also had an impressive cider selection. We tried a couple of their house ciders, and they were a refreshing complement to our meal. The variety of flavors and styles available truly showcased the craft and creativity of the cider makers.

Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience at The Cider Press. The combination of delicious farm-to-table cuisine, attentive service, and cozy atmosphere made for a memorable visit.

"This is a very cute little Mexican restaurant in Chestnut Hill! I walked in with a friend for dinner on a Friday night. I had a reservation but looked like I didn't really need one. The restaurant was busy but there weren't any lines and there were some open tables which was surprising 

I started off with a drink - prickly pear margarita. This was recommended to me by the waiter as the top fruitiest drink at the restaurant. I very much enjoyed it! I was first surprised when it first came out bc I thought it would be more of a clear/yellow color but the drink was dark red! It tasted sweet and tarty and just like sweet pear! Yum!

My friend and I ordered the guacamole, carnitas tacos (4 piece) and the Baja tacos (3 pieces). The guacamole was delicious and well made. Creamy and delish! The Baja tacos were crispy and hot on the inside - just the way I like my fish tacos yum! It was topped off with pickled radish?? And a spicy orange sauce
The carnitas were the better of the two however. Baja was good but the carnitas!!! I took one bite and I instantly fell in love. The meat was so soft and literally melted in my mouth! 

I really enjoyed having dinner at this restaurant and really hope I'll have a chance to come back.

Other notes:
They have a tiny little lot in the back but its very limited (only 5-7 cars maybe). Street parking is best.
They also have an outside patio area which looked cute. I'm sure it'll be super cute and nice to eat out there once the weather gets warmer",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"We came here on the weekend without a reservation (brave!) and sat at the bar to wait for a table. Soon, however, the hostess came over and told us there was a cancellation and they can seat us right away. Score! 

We got the BBQ fries as an appetizer and OH GOD. OH. GOD. They were so good. The brisket was cooked perfectly, and the cheese sauce was a nice creamy compliment. These fries got me all pumped up for the rest of our meal.

I ordered the ribs and corn bread, and M ordered the brisket sandwich and mac n' cheese. The ribs had a really good flavor, but didn't fall off the bone, so that made me sad. I like when the rib meat comes off in one fell swoop. This is the ONLY thing that brought it down to four stars. (Honestly, I really wanted to try the chicken, so I'll be back for that.)

M really enjoyed his brisket sandwich. He said it was really tender, and he wolfed it down. The mac and cheese was yummy, and the cornbread was buttery and delicious with a nice kick from the jalapeno.

"I recently dined at Late Harvest Kitchen, and I must say, it was a disappointing experience from start to finish. I had high hopes for this place based on its reputation, but unfortunately, it fell far below my expectations.

First off, the service was abysmal. It took an eternity for our server to take our order, and even longer for the food to arrive. We had to constantly wave down the server just to get attention, which made the whole dining experience incredibly frustrating.

The food itself was a huge letdown. The menu boasted a variety of creative dishes, but the execution was lacking. My appetizer was overcooked and lacked flavor, while my main course was underwhelming and poorly presented. The portion sizes were also on the smaller side, leaving me feeling unsatisfied.

In addition to the disappointing food, the atmosphere was also lacking. The restaurant was dimly lit, which made it difficult to read the menu. The noise level was also quite high, making it hard to hold a conversation with my dining companions.

To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of the food and service. I felt like I was paying a premium for a subpar dining experience, which left a bad taste in my mouth both figuratively and literally.

Overall, I would not recommend Late Harvest Kitchen. The poor service, underwhelming food, and high prices make it an establishment I won't be returning to.

"Yellow porch is fantastic lunch spot, and I'm not the only one who thinks so.  I'd say everyone withing driving distance of this place agrees.  Lunchtimes here are hectic and the parking lot can definitely not accommodate that, so be aware.  It's small and cozy inside, exactly like sitting in a little cottage like the porch in the name implies, but the food is really good.  Their sandwiches are yummy and they have a fantastic coucous salad that makes a great substitute for fries or some other greasy potato option.  The service is great despite the constant influx of patrons, and you can get out of here relatively quickly if you're just coming here on a work lunch break.  I would say keep your lunch party small, again due to space, but I really like this little spot when I do get a chance to enjoy it.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I ordered the fish tacos and I can't believe they even served up what they did; terrible deep fried frozen fish sticks with a little bit of cabbage on top of them.
This is such an amazing and iconic location in Boise I just can't understand why they can't get great chefs to create wonderful, locally sourced, delicious food. The prices say they could afford it.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Rolling into Sonic Drive-In was like driving back into a nostalgic piece of Americana. Immediately, the unique drive-in concept reminded me of days when dining in your car was the norm. My experience here felt like a modern twist on a classic scene, complete with roller-skating servers who were both friendly and prompt with their service.

I opted for a classic cheeseburger and tots, which Sonic nails perfectly. The burger was juicy and flavorful, with all the traditional fixings, while the tots were the crisp, golden nuggets of comfort food you hope for. The cherry limeade, one of their vast selection of fountain drinks, was expertly mixed and effervescently refreshing—a perfect pairing to the meal on a warm day.

The atmosphere was lively without being overwhelming; there was a pleasant buzz that seemed to encapsulate the essence of a family-friendly outing. The neatness of the establishment also stood out; despite being a high-traffic fast food destination, their cleanliness was impeccable.

The reason my rating falls short of a perfect five stars is due to a slightly longer-than-expected wait time for food delivery and the sandwich's bun-to-ingredient ratio leaning a bit too heavily on the bready side. Nonetheless, the overall experience was delightful. Sonic left me with a satiated appetite and a smile, making it a spot I'd confidently recommend to those seeking a quick, enjoyable bite in a uniquely charming setting.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review: I had an amazing dining experience at Main Street Grille! From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the clean and modern ambiance. It was evident that the restaurant had recently undergone renovations, as everything looked fresh and new. The service was impeccable, with our waiter being friendly and attentive throughout the evening.

Although the restaurant was busy, our waiter managed to handle all the tables efficiently. It did take a slightly longer time to get our drink orders, but considering the busyness of the place, it was understandable. Besides, our waiter made up for it with his excellent service.

Now, let's talk about the food. It was outstanding! Every dish we ordered was cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The portions were just right, not too large but definitely satisfying. I particularly loved the attention to detail in the presentation of the dishes.

The only downside I found was the price. While the quality of the food and service was exceptional, I felt that some of the items on the menu were a bit overpriced. However, despite this, I still enjoyed my dining experience and would definitely return to Main Street Grille.

In summary, Main Street Grille is a fantastic restaurant that offers an impressive dining experience. The ambiance is inviting, the service is top-notch, and the food is simply delicious. While the prices may be slightly on the higher side, the overall experience is worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Review: 2 Stars

Character 1: Disappointed Diner

The moment I stepped into El Vez, I was filled with anticipation. The vibrant atmosphere and decor suggested a lively and enjoyable dining experience. Sadly, that initial excitement quickly faded away as my dining experience at El Vez progressed. 

From the moment we sat down, it became apparent that the service was lacking. Our waiter seemed disinterested and rarely checked on our table. It took an eternity for him to take our orders, and even longer for our food to arrive. We felt neglected and ignored throughout the entire evening.

Character 2: Mediocre Mexican

As a fan of Mexican cuisine, I was eager to try the dishes at El Vez. However, my taste buds were left underwhelmed and disappointed. The food lacked the authentic flavors and boldness that I was hoping for. The guacamole was bland and lacked the freshness I expected, while the tacos were dry and lacking in seasoning. Each bite only reminded me of missed opportunities for flavor exploration.

Furthermore, the portions seemed unreasonably small given the price. For the price of a taco, I would expect a satisfying portion, but I was left feeling unsatisfied and wanting more.

Overall, El Vez fell short of my expectations in both service and taste. The lackluster service and mediocre food prevent me from giving this establishment a higher rating. I will continue my search for an authentic and satisfying Mexican dining experience elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Embarking on a quest to discover the ultimate donut experience, I stumbled upon a real treasure – Bakers Dozen Donuts. This quaint little haven is a throwback to the old-fashioned donut shops, with its warm, inviting atmosphere and the intoxicating aroma of sugar and spice that hugs you upon entry.

The magic begins once you peruse the extensive selection of perfectly glazed and sugar-dusted circles of joy. The classic yeast donuts are cloud-like, with a delicate, airy texture that dissolves on the tongue, while the cake donuts are the epitome of comfort, dense yet tender with a slight crunch to the crust. From traditional favorites like luscious chocolate frosted and the pristine simplicity of powdered sugar, to innovative creations bursting with inventive flavors and fillings, Bakers Dozen Donuts hits every sweet spot imaginable.

Each donut is crafted with a love for the art of baking – evident in the brioche-like softness of their dough and the balance of sweetness that never overwhelms but satisfies. But what truly sets Bakers Dozen Donuts apart is not just the superior quality of their offerings, but the palpable passion and friendliness of the staff. They serve each patron with a genuine smile and the kind of hospitality that makes you feel like a regular on your very first visit.

Whether you're a donut aficionado or a casual enthusiast of circular confections, Bakers Dozen Donuts is an indulgence worth savoring. Perfect in its simplicity, rich in flavor, and generous in spirit – this unassuming spot earns its five stars with every bite.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I really couldn't contain my excitement when I found this place! An Australian cafe that serves MEAT PIES! Do you know how hard that is to find in this state, or even country?! I was pumped.

And! I wasn't let down by it's deliciousness either. I spent over a week in Australia and had tons of them there, and honestly this one could compete. The flavor was great, all it was missing was mashed potatoes and gravy (not sure why this wasn't an option:( .

I chose the tomato soup to accompany it, which was also delicious. It was a little chunky, and was bursting with flavor. My son had fruit and yogurt which was very fresh. And my husband's meal was the salmon Benedict- he loved it! Dill isn't really my thing in that combination, but he said the flavors complimented each other well. 

The service here was also very good, it's a casual setting with friendly staff. I love the background story of the business, too! That really shows that they have some heart and passion behind what they're doing. Love seeing that.

"I fly in and out of MSY pretty regularly and it's a consistent 3-star airport. 

Pros: 
- Almost always speedy to get through security, and gates are spacious and have plenty of seating and outlets to charge your phone/laptop
- Free 20 minute sessions of Wifi, but you can connect as many times as you want. I've never tried to stream video, but Wifi is speedy when using email and social media
- Friendly staff! 

Cons:
- Awful food options. I almost always fly on Southwest, and terminal B desperately needs better offerings. Zatarain's Kitchen is bad, and there's only so much you can buy at Hudson News that will sustain you through a flight.

The traditional dogs are very good, with simple sides in a simple ambiance - perfect for those mid-shopping-spree-munchies while you're wandering around Paso Nuevo.

"Tommy DiNic's holds a reputation that creates expectations as lofty as their famed meaty sandwiches. However, during my visit to this Reading Terminal Market staple, I found my experience to be as layered and complex as their roast pork creation, resulting in a solid but unremarkable three-star review.

The ambiance of the market itself brims with the energy of Philadelphia's heart, but the charm does get somewhat lost in the throng of the lunchtime rush. Service at DiNic's was prompt, a notable feat given the crowd, but lacked the warmth you might find at other local eateries.

As for the main event, the roast pork sandwich, it was a study in contrasts. The bread, a crucial foundation, held its own, fresh, with that perfect balance of chew and give. The meat was indeed tender, clearly slow-cooked with care, but it was shy on seasoning, whispering where it ought to shout. The sharp provolone offered a nice tang, but it felt disengaged from the sandwich, like an afterthought rather than a key player. The greens added a necessary bitterness, but their flavor was drowned in the mix.

While there's no question that the ingredients are of quality, the symphony of flavors I anticipated turned out to be more of a disjointed jam session. A stronger hand in seasoning and a more cohesive construction would elevate this sandwich from good to great.

Would I return? Perhaps. Tommy DiNic's lays down a sturdy base hit in the field of Philly sandwiches but doesn't quite knock it out of the park. If you find yourself in the market, it may be worth your while, but temper your expectations - this sandwich may not be the culinary home run you've been led to expect.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review: I recently had the pleasure of attending a performance at Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts and I must say, it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The theater itself has a charming and kitschy vibe with its signature gold dome, and the acoustics were absolutely top-notch.

I was lucky enough to catch a show of STOMP and it was mind-blowing. The way they create complex rhythmic beats using everyday objects like matchsticks is truly impressive. The tickets were reasonably priced at $75 and worth every penny.

The theater isn't too big, which I appreciated as it created a more intimate and immersive experience. Parking was relatively easy to find, although I would advise against wearing heels as the parking might be a few blocks away.

The will-call ticket area was fast and efficient, and the seating chart was accurate in depicting where we would be sitting. For broadway shows or events like STOMP, I highly recommend splurging on tickets in the first or second sections for an up-close view of the action.

Overall, I feel fortunate that Reno has a theater like Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. It's a gem that surpasses the larger coliseum at UNR.

"Restaurant Review: Office Depot

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Office Depot, and to say that it was a unique experience would be an understatement. This restaurant, located in the heart of the city, offers a dining experience unlike any other. From the moment I stepped inside, I was immersed in a world that was equal parts modern and quirky.

The ambiance of Office Depot is truly something to behold. The interior is designed to resemble a fully functioning office space, complete with cubicles, file cabinets, and even a water cooler. The attention to detail is remarkable, with decor items that reflect the theme, such as pen holders shaped like staplers and paper clips adorning the walls.

The menu at Office Depot is equally creative. The dishes are named after office supplies, and each one is as delicious as it is whimsical. I decided to start with the ""Stapler Salad,"" a fresh and vibrant mix of greens, cherry tomatoes, and feta cheese, dressed in a tangy vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was sensational, and it set the stage for the rest of the meal.

For the main course, I opted for the ""Fountain Pen Pasta,"" a dish that showcased perfectly cooked pasta swimming in a creamy Alfredo sauce. The addition of chicken and sun-dried tomatoes brought a delightful burst of flavor to the dish. The portion size was generous, and I appreciated the attention to detail in plating.

To end the meal on a sweet note, I indulged in the ""Sticky Tape Sundae."" It was a decadent dessert consisting of layers of vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, crushed peanuts, and chocolate shavings. The combination of textures and flavors was pure bliss, and I savored every spoonful.

The service at Office Depot was exceptional. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and professional. They were quick to recommend their favorite dishes and were happy to assist with any special requests. The waitstaff truly embraced the office theme, donning crisp white shirts and black slacks, further adding to the authenticity of the restaurant's concept.

In terms of value, Office Depot exceeded expectations. The prices were reasonable, considering the quality of the food and the unique dining experience. The portion sizes were substantial, ensuring that no one left hungry. This restaurant is perfect for a casual lunch with friends or a unique dinner date.

"This place is a little weird.  Definitely a dive.  This was clearly an old fast food place from the early 60's and they've done NOTHING to make it appealing in any way.  You order through a little window to a guy you can't really see very well.  It looks really crowded and awful back behind the glass.  Don't take a job here.  There are some ancient fast food type tables/chairs that were reasonably clean, but my guess is that's just a lucky coincidence for me.  Most people just get the food to go.

The restaurant's decor was a perfect blend of modern elegance and traditional Southern charm. The exposed brick walls, dark wood accents, and dim lighting created an intimate atmosphere that was both inviting and cozy. The live jazz music playing softly in the background added a touch of enchantment to the evening.

I started my culinary journey with a refreshing cocktail recommended by the knowledgeable and friendly staff. The menu offered a delightful array of classic New Orleans dishes with a modern twist. Being a seafood lover, I couldn't resist ordering the Crawfish Étouffée. The dish was a revelation! The crawfish were plump and tender, bathed in a rich, flavorful sauce that left me longing for more.

For the main course, I opted for the Blackened Redfish. The fish was cooked to perfection, with a crispy, flavorful crust that gave way to wonderfully moist flesh. The accompanying vegetable medley and garlic mashed potatoes complemented the dish perfectly, creating a harmonious blend of flavors.

Despite being completely satisfied with my meal, I couldn't resist indulging in one of their decadent desserts. The Bananas Foster Bread Pudding was a heavenly treat that brought together the sweet flavors of caramelized bananas and warm, gooey bread pudding. It was a symphony of flavors that left me wanting to lick my plate clean.

One highlight of the meal was the exceptional service provided by the staff. The waitstaff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They made sure to accommodate any dietary restrictions or preferences, ensuring a pleasant dining experience for all.

I couldn't resist indulging in their famous cafe au lait, which was simply divine. The balance of creamy milk and strong coffee was impeccable, making it a must-try.

The only reason I didn't give Cafe Du Monde a perfect five-star rating was because of the occasional noise level in the restaurant. Although the ambiance overall was cozy, there were moments where the chatter and clanging of dishes became a bit overwhelming.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Nashville Public Library, and overall, I had a delightful experience. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I was captivated by its unique and quirky ambiance. The walls adorned with bookshelves and literary quotes gave the place a cozy and inviting feel, reminiscent of a classic library.

The wide array of menu options impressed me. Whether you're a meat lover, vegetarian, or vegan, there is something for everyone. I opted for the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. The chicken was perfectly crispy and had that spicy kick that left a lasting impression on my taste buds.

Service was attentive and efficient. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and they seemed genuinely passionate about their work. My server was quick to offer suggestions and answer any questions I had about the menu, which was a nice touch.

One aspect that stood out to me was the extensive drink menu. Nashville Public Library offers an impressive variety of craft beers, cocktails, and mocktails. I tried their signature ""Bookworm Martini,"" and it was absolutely delightful, with just the right balance of flavors.

The only downside was the noise level. As the restaurant got busier, it became quite loud, making it a bit challenging to engage in conversations without raising our voices. However, this may be expected in a popular and lively establishment like Nashville Public Library.

In terms of price, this restaurant was reasonably priced considering the quality and portion sizes. The portions were generous, and I left feeling satisfied.

"T N Crab Shack offers a delightful seafood experience akin to a seaside visit in the heart of the city. Upon entering, the nautical decor and the soft melody of sea-inspired tunes immediately set a laid-back ambiance. The staff, donning maritime-themed uniforms, were attentive without being overbearing, adding a personal touch to the dining experience.

The menu is a treasure trove of seafood delights, but clearly, the house specialty is the crab. I savored the 'Shack's Signature Crab Pot'—a bountiful feast of fresh, succulent crabs bathed in a secret blend of spices that tingled my palate with a combination of heat and robust flavors. The corn on the cob and potatoes served alongside were a comforting complement that soaked up the rich, zesty sauce.

While the crab was an immersive culinary journey, the side dish of hush puppies was a tad too dense, resulting in the only minor letdown of the meal. The dessert selection was modest but sufficient, offering a sweet conclusion with a zesty lemon tart that delivered a punch of citrus to cleanse the palate.

In all, T N Crab Shack merits its high reputation, proving itself as a standout establishment that elevates traditional crab fare with flair and exceptional taste. A solid four-star dining escapade that promises return visits.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, that's where the good things stopped. The food was just OK. We ordered the mac and cheese as an app along with the burger and cheesesteak as main courses. Everything was flat to me. Nothing was bad, it was all mediocre. The mac and cheese was the only thing I'd consider ordering again. At the price point, which is on the higher end for bar type dining ($14 burger), I did not find the food up to par. 

That being said, it's definitely a cute place and we enjoyed our experience overall. If we return it may just for a drink and app.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Riverwalk Marketplace is a gem along the waterfront. Delightful ambiance with stunning views set the mood for an exceptional dining experience. We were greeted with warm hospitality and seated promptly. The menu boasted a variety of fresh, local ingredients, and the dishes certainly delivered in both flavor and presentation. I highly recommend the blackened fish - a testament to the chef's expertise. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The Marketplace harmoniously blends shopping with gastronomy, making it a must-visit. An unequivocal five-star treat!",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review

I had an amazing experience at Four Seasons Food Court and would definitely recommend it to others. Despite initially having reservations about the exterior appearance of the restaurant, I decided to give it a chance and I'm so glad I did.

The variety of food options available was impressive. There were so many choices that I found it difficult to make up my mind. I particularly appreciated that they offered vegetarian protein options, such as their delicious fried tofu. It's always great to see restaurants catering to different dietary preferences.

The quality of the food was excellent, surpassing my expectations for a food court. Every dish I tried was flavorful and well-prepared. The buffet-style setup allowed me to have a satisfying and varied meal without breaking the bank. The price was definitely worth the quality of the food.

The staff at Four Seasons Food Court were friendly and attentive. They promptly cleared tables and ensured that the dining area was clean and inviting. The overall atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable, making it a pleasant place to enjoy a meal.

If you're looking for a quick bite to eat and a wide range of options, I highly recommend visiting Four Seasons Food Court. With its delicious food, affordable prices, and friendly staff, it's a great place to satisfy any cravings. I rate my experience here with 5 stars out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Stratford Diner truly exceeded my expectations in every way possible. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and friendly smile from the hostess, setting the tone for what turned out to be a memorable dining experience. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was inviting and cozy, with a tasteful decor that created a relaxing atmosphere. The seating was comfortable, and the soft background music added just the right touch to set the mood for a great meal. 

The menu at Stratford Diner was extensive and offered a wide range of options to cater to every palate. From classic American comfort food to international cuisine, there was something for everyone. I was particularly impressed with the variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options available, as this shows a dedication to accommodating all dietary preferences and restrictions. 

When my food arrived, I could instantly tell that it was prepared with care and attention to detail. The presentation was impeccable, and the flavors were truly exquisite. Each dish was bursting with freshness, and the ingredients were of the highest quality. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left satisfied but not overly stuffed.

The service at Stratford Diner was unparalleled. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and always had a smile on their faces. They were quick to address any questions or requests I had, and their promptness in refilling my water glass did not go unnoticed.

My overall experience at Stratford Diner was nothing short of exceptional.

I truly cannot recommend it enough.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"I recently dined at H & W Produce, and I must say, it was a disappointing experience. From the moment I walked in, the lack of ambience and cleanliness was evident. The tables were dirty, and the overall decor seemed outdated. The service was equally disappointing, with staff members appearing disinterested and inattentive. As for the food, it left a lot to be desired. The produce tasted bland and lacked freshness, leaving me with a feeling of regret for choosing this restaurant.

"Restaurant Name: Radicchio Cafe
Rating: ★★★★★ (5 stars)

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Radicchio Cafe and I must say, it was a fantastic experience from start to finish.

The moment I walked into the restaurant, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive, making me feel instantly welcomed. The interior was tastefully decorated, creating a cozy and intimate ambience.

I was fortunate enough to secure a table outside on a beautiful evening. Sitting on Wood street, across from a park, made for a delightful setting. The gentle breeze and serene surroundings added to the overall charm of my dining experience.

The menu offered a variety of enticing options, making it difficult to choose. I started with the calamari special appetizer. While it wasn't the best calamari I've had, it was still enjoyable. The calamari was a bit chewy and lacked a bit of flavor, but it was still a decent start to the meal.

For my main course, I opted for the sea bass in a lemon caper sauce. This dish blew me away. The fish was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender, and the sauce added a burst of tangy freshness. It was a symphony of flavors that left me craving for more.

My dining companion chose the amatriciana pasta, which was equally impressive. The pasta was cooked al dente, and the combination of pancetta, tomatoes, and cheese was a match made in culinary heaven. The portion size was generous, ensuring we left satisfied.

One aspect that I particularly appreciated about Radicchio Cafe is that it is BYO (Bring Your Own). This allowed us to pair our meal with our favorite bottle of wine, making the experience even more enjoyable. And as an added bonus, the restaurant even offered us a complimentary glass of limoncello.

The service throughout the evening was impeccable. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and made great recommendations. He ensured our glasses were always filled and our needs were promptly attended to.

Overall, my experience at Radicchio Cafe was exceptional. The combination of great food, a charming atmosphere, and friendly service made it a memorable dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a delightful culinary adventure.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"I went to The Pond on a Sunday afternoon about an hour before they close. Keep in mind they close early - 2:00 I believe. Even though it was right before closing time, everything in the kitchen was still available and the staff was still super friendly! As soon as you walk in you are surrounded by frog décor everything. Lots of green, frog statues, lily pads, etc., they really went all out at the St. Pete location with the frog! Aside from everything being a frog the food was amazing! I had the chef special of the day - Spanish Chicken Philly- I was anticipating a chicken philly with a Spanish flare what I received was WAY better! It was a breakfast wrap of sorts. A large flour tortilla stuffed with tender so juicy chicken, chorizo, white American cheese, sautéed peppers and onions, and so much flavor! The burrito/wrap was served with a side of fries. I asked for mine extra extra crispy(as I always do) and they delivered! I will certainly return to The Pond!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Love this place! Great cause too. I wish they would extend their hours, but we went for lunch recently. The food comes out fairly quickly. I enjoy watching the young staff proudly learn the profession. You may be thinking oh, it's pre made food it won't be as good. Nope, don't do that to yourself. It's good. All of it. Well, everything that I have had.

The fish was nicely seasoned and the potato salad was great. This restaurant only gets three stars because I would not come here on my own, but I would if my boss was paying.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Red Mesa Cantina - 1/5 Stars

F O O D

I had high hopes for Red Mesa Cantina, but I was left disappointed. The food was incredibly underwhelming, bordering on mediocre. It felt like overpriced bar food, lacking any distinct flavors or culinary creativity. Nothing about the dishes stood out or made me want to come back.

D R I N K S

On the positive side, Red Mesa Cantina does offer an extensive selection of tequila. If that's your drink of choice, you won't be disappointed. However, if you prefer something other than tequila, they do have a full bar and can accommodate various preferences.

S E R V I C E

The service was the only aspect of my experience that was remotely acceptable. Our server at the bar was friendly and attentive. She regularly checked on us and ensured we had everything we needed. However, good service alone cannot redeem a restaurant with subpar food.

O V E R A L L

To be fair, the outdoor seating area of Red Mesa Cantina is charming and inviting. It has the potential to create a pleasant atmosphere for gatherings with friends. However, the lackluster food overshadows any positives the restaurant may have. Overall, I cannot recommend Red Mesa Cantina based on my disappointing experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Finally getting around to checking out this establishment which was on my local bucket list. Husband and I came on a Wednesday night during Nashville Originals Restaurant Week. This place definitely has the English pub vibe going on. Great atmosphere. Pool and darts upstairs, live music downstairs. And a nice patio and corn hole for when the weather is nice.

Don't come here for the food. Come here to hang out and have a drink, play some pool, or listen to the music. They have standard pub fare plus the English pub favs-shephard's pie, fish and chips, etc, plus a few unique items and nicer entrees like filet. The food was good (I got a patty melt, my husband the shepherd's pie), but nothing to rave about. Of course this is a pub so I wasn't expecting 5 star cuisine. Service was good on our visit.

Overall, this is a solid place to come hang out on a Friday or Saturday night with friends. Food is the afterthought here. We'll probably come back when it's patio weather!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"How beautiful, how romantic, how detail oriented!!! I'm obsessed!! If you've never visited here around the holidays, but you love Christmas lights, you won't be disappointed!!

Upon walking in, there are friendly faces everywhere you look! You'll start the tour by seeing real reindeer and the option of purchasing a warm drink for your chilly walk. I passed on the drink option, but how cool to see 2 real reindeer around the holidays!

As you stroll down the brightly lite pathways, you'll hear laughter and joy from people passing by, tons of selfies being taken, the largest mistletoe I've ever seen, a train station, colorful light displays on the pond, a breathtaking view of downtown Nashville from the mansion, and the art museum... ugh!... I can't say enough about its beauty! The mansion/ museum has tons of beautiful art, a poinsettia tree that you could awe at for hours, and enough room to walk, so that I never felt crowded (keep in mind I came on a Sunday night).

Now for the icing on the cake... there were Christmas Carolers! Yep, at this point, my entire trip was made. I'm a sucker for Christmas songs, and I could honestly listen to them for hours!! I felt awful because I didn't have cash on me to tip them with, but man, the 3 of them really made my week! They could tell I was enjoying myself so much that they asked me if they could sing a song special for me! I asked, and boy did they deliver!!! Bravo, bravo!!

"Before I get started I will just say that there is only a certain rating or level that any Buffet could get to as they are a buffet. The whole purpose is to have many choices and fast. That's not a fault that's just the way it is. First of all the value is very good. For the price whether you're using the coupon or paying full price they are very reasonably priced establishment. We had the luck of using a coupon and went at a very busy time. The decor is nice however some of the booths and chairs are starting to deteriorate but again this is typical of a buffet that has a very high turn around so it is to be expected. They have a wonderful space as you walk in that has a spacious pond with numerous koi fish. Children can even go to the counter to get food to feed the fish I believe for $0.50. I may be a grown-up but it was delightful to see all the fish. We were promptly seated by a very kind and delightful hostess. All of the waitresses were very friendly and kept on top of our beverages. Now when it comes to selection this place is top-notch. There are Endless Options For any pallet. They have a Hibachi station so you can create whatever your heart desires. There is a barbecue area, an abundance of fried options, a a whole row of sea food that does include crabs and crayfish but at the time we went there were no snow crabs available. The crabs were very tasty. The crayfish were mostly good but there were some that were either overcooked or spoiled. Most people that know how to eat them know when not to consume them. There is a nice salad bar that had a raw bar attached, I did not try any of the raw clams or oysters, while they did look quite fresh I did not want to chance it. There is a decent selection of sushi along the front. Generous portions of raw fish on the nigiri. It was quite busy when we went so it was a marathon to try to get what you wanted but it was a peak hour. Overall I went in not thinking that I would enjoy myself very much but in the end I really enjoyed the food and I feel that it's a good value and much better than a fortune cookie at the end of a meal you can stand and view all of the gorgeous fish before going on your way.

"after staying at an airbnb for a couple nights and upon moving here, i realized that a good hotel is irreplaceable. sure, you can get a more home-y environment, custom touch and quaintness from some airbnb's, but sometimes the service and convenience of a hotel can't be beat. good hotels have hospitality down to a science. was happy they were able to accommodate me for an early checkin. 

le meridien is in a modern building and lodging in an older city. riverside, my room had a little peek of the river from the window and with double beds was plush, sleek, yet spacious (when i was researching hotels in the area, many were in older buildings with cramped quarters and sometimes no windows). bed was cushy and very comfortable. large 55 or 60"" LG led tv. plenty of lights and a comfy sectional to sit. the bathroom was clean and modern with nice toiletry. free reliable wifi. 

location is great in the central business district (CBD - i highly recommend staying in this part of the city as it's walkable yet away from the noise and crowds of bourbon street). bar downstairs is on the pricier side but makes decent cocktails. lots of lounge area in the lobby for friends to come wait for you. due to my short stay, i didn't get to check out the gym. the business center was helpful to take care of some work stuff when i hadn't brought my laptop.

"Restaurant Name: Pat's King of Steaks

Review: I had heard so much about Pat's King of Steaks and was excited to try it for myself. Unfortunately, my experience was incredibly disappointing. Firstly, the service was incredibly slow and unorganized. It took forever for my order to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive.

When the food finally did arrive, I was underwhelmed. The cheesesteak was mediocre at best. The meat was dry and lacked flavor, and the cheese was barely present. The bread was also quite stale, which made the whole sandwich unpleasant to eat. It was such a letdown after all the hype surrounding this place.

To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant for what we received. I felt like I was paying a premium just for the name and not for the quality of the food.

We went here looking for some ugly Christmas sweaters and found quite a lot. There are old lady clothes a plenty and some for the kids as well. They were a bit more pricey than other thrift stores in the area... but they also had a larger selection. 

The one thing that I did like (and was pleasantly surprised about) was that the staff was overwhelmingly helpful. I was shocked that it was easy to find assistance and *gasp* they were pleasant! Perhaps I am a bit used to the Savers in larger cities where they sort of ignore you and do your thing... but when I stated what we were looking for the girl behind the front register was happy to help.

My experience at Johnny's Po-Boys was a mixed bag. The restaurant itself had a nice, casual atmosphere, but I found the service to be a bit lacking. It took a while for someone to acknowledge us and take our order, and even then, they seemed rushed and not very attentive.

I decided to try their famous po-boy sandwich, and while it was good, it didn't knock my socks off. I ordered the shrimp po-boy, and the shrimp itself was well-cooked and flavorful. However, I felt that the sandwich lacked a bit in terms of accompanying flavors and condiments.

The portion size was generous, and the bread was fresh and crusty, which I appreciated. However, I would have liked to see a bit more variety in the fillings and toppings to truly elevate the sandwich.

The prices at Johnny's Po-Boys were reasonable, and the portion size made it a good value for money. However, considering the quality and taste, I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to visit this restaurant again.

"From the moment I stepped into Apolline Restaurant, I was enveloped in a warmth that only foreshadowed the culinary delights to come. The atmosphere struck a delicate balance between elegance and comfort, with ambient lighting that made each table seem like an intimate cocoon.

The service was impeccable; the staff was attentive without being intrusive, finely tuned to the rhythms of our dining experience. They shared recommendations with an affable expertise that was both welcoming and insightful.

The menu, a testament to culinary creativity, offered a symphony of flavors with every dish. The amuse-bouche was an unexpected pleasure, setting the stage for the thoughtful gastronomy to follow. The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the seared scallops, which were perfectly caramelized, juxtaposed with a delicate pea puree that was a revelation in its simplicity and depth of flavor.

What stood out was the chef's innovative spirit, evident in the harmonious blend of traditional techniques with a modern twist. Each course built upon the last, culminating in a dessert that was not just a treat for the palate but a visually stunning art piece.

Apolline Restaurant's wine list complemented the meal exquisitely, offering a selection that catered to both the novice and the connoisseur. The pairing suggested by our sommelier was a masterstroke, enhancing our dining journey.

My experience at Apolline Restaurant was nothing short of extraordinary. It's a place where each dish tells a story, crafted with passion and served with pride.

"Amelia's presents an intriguing dining experience that encapsulates both the delights and the disappointments of casual dining. Situated in a cozy corner of the neighborhood, the entrance beckons with promises of homely comforts. The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and rustic decor creating a welcoming atmosphere. The staff greeted us with genuine smiles, albeit with a noticeable rush that hinted at being understaffed for the evening.

The menu is an eclectic mix of classic and imaginative dishes, suggesting an ambition in the kitchen. Our appetizers—a caprese salad and garlic shrimp—were agreeable, if not memorable. The freshness of the tomatoes in the caprese was commendable, but the inclusion of overripe avocado was a misstep.

Entrees followed, and here Amelia's showed both its strengths and flaws. The seared salmon over a bed of wild rice displayed the chef's ability to cook fish to a perfect flakiness, yet the accompanying sauce was unduly heavy, overshadowing the rice's natural flavors. My companion's steak was cooked just to their liking; however, the side of vegetables seemed like a forgotten thought, lacking seasoning and zest.

Dessert was Amelia's redemption. A deconstructed cheesecake with a berry compote demonstrated a playful and successful approach to reimagining a classic. It was truly the highlight of our meal.

Service throughout was polite, though it lacked the attentiveness that elevates a dining experience. Not once did our server check in during the main course, and we found ourselves longingly peeking at water pitchers across the room.

In conclusion, Amelia's is a conundrum wrapped in a paradox. It offers sparks of culinary potential stifled by inconsistencies. If the kinks are worked out, it has the making of a neighborhood gem. For now, it's a solid choice when options are limited, but not a destination in its own right.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"If you have a tattoo or are thinking about getting a tattoo, you have to see the new Tattoo exhibit at the Seaport Museum.

That's just the most recent exhibit... I went with family to see the museum a few times and if you're in to Philadelphia history, this is the museum to go to.

"I had an overall great experience at Clementine's Naughty & Nice Creamery! Our server was awesome. Didn't catch his name but he was working around 2pm on Saturday. He was cracking jokes with us and didn't mind that I wanted to sample a million flavors. 

Gourmet ice cream spots are pretty much a dime a dozen these days, but I thought that the naughty vs. nice concept at Clementine's was so original. The naughty flavors were infused with booze while the nice flavors weren't. The quality of the ice cream itself was excellent - very smooth and creamy. 

The flavors at Clementine's were highly creative. The level of uniqueness reminded me a lot of Salt and Straw from Portland. Some of the flavors were just flat out freakin' weird, but I tried them anyway! Here's a rundown of the flavors I tried...

Nice:
- Asparagus, Agave, Quinoa tasted exactly as described. Didn't love it but didn't hate it. And clearly people love it, because the container was half full. 

- Manchego (with truffle and honey) was oddly good. It's savory and sweet at the same time. You can definitely taste the truffle oil and manchego cheese, but the honey does a great job subduing those two flavors and bringing it all together. 

Naughty:
- I really liked Boozy Banana Rum. You get the hint of rum, but the banana was the prominent flavor. 

- Maple Bourbon was my favorite of all the three Naughty flavors I tried. I'm a huge fan of bourbon, but the maple syrup complimented it so well!

- Chocolate Milk Stout was not bad. I didn't think it was particularly standout compared to the other 2 naughty flavors, but I could totally see this being a favorite among chocolate lovers. The stout flavor is subtle. 

I'm told that there's an old fashioned flavor, which was unfortunately unavailable when I was there! What a bummer, because I also am a huge fan of whiskey. Fingers crossed that it'll be there next time I'm in STL.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Tapas arrived lukewarm, suggesting they sat too long before serving. The famed ceviche lacked zest, puzzling for a namesake dish. Patatas bravas were overly oily, and the gambas al ajillo had an overpowering garlic punch, lacking balance. Though the sangria was decent, it couldn't salvage the meal.

"Mmmm St. Yared's. This is an AMAZING authentic Ethiopian restaurant on Fall Creek Rd. in Indianapolis. I have been there several times (how did I not know it has been here for more than 4 years??) for lunch with my dad and can't say enough good things about it.

When you go inside there is a bar area to the left with bottles of wine and beer lining the wall and a few stools at the counter. On your right is the actual restaurant, which has a handful of tables and booths, and a coffee bar on the far right end with authentic Ethiopian coffees and teas, including packages for sale. The walls are covered in murals and framed prints done by Ethiopian artists, and other pieces of art. There is quiet Ethiopian instrumental music playing in the background. It definitely has a very authentic Ethiopian feeling to it. 

When you walk in, you are greeted (most likely with a handshake and/or a hug because in Ethiopian culture once you have encountered someone once you are like family) by Haile, the owner, who runs the restaurant along with his family. He is very friendly and hospitable, coming around to each table to check on you and also to share with you about his culture. My dad and I really enjoyed hearing about the history of Ethiopia and Christianity, and customs Haile has brought with him. He is also very interested in people so he loves to hear about us and what is going on in our lives. I personally enjoy being in a restaurant where I feel like a part of the family and not just another customer. 

The food is AMAZING! I have actually only had one thing on the menu because my first time there I loved it soooo much I haven't bothered to look at anything else! And because there are so many options that I have to read through because they are Ethiopian specialties, that I just decided to go with what I knew was good. What was that one dish, you ask? It is called Ye-Doro Tibs and is cubed chicken breast cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic and ginger, with their special Ethiopian Berbere seasoning and served with Injera. Injera is flat, spongy and bread-like, rolled up like small pieces of paper and is used to scoop up all of the food. Yes, all dishes come without silverware, in authentic Ethiopian fashion. However, you can request it if you just don't feel comfortable using your hands. As far as the menu, they offer all kinds of meat, as well as vegetarian and vegan options, so there is something for everyone. It is definitely a place well worth checking out especially if you want to try something different and cultural. I think it's about time for another visit...",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently visited the uniquely themed Body Art Tattoos and Piercings and was pleasantly surprised to find it an exceptional dining experience. Contrary to what the name suggests, this is a restaurant that creatively merges the worlds of culinary arts and body art, offering guests an unusual ambiance filled with tattoo-inspired decor.

The menu cleverly mirrors various tattoo styles, providing a diverse range of dishes that cater to all palates. My appetizer, the ""Traditional Sailor Ink"" squid ink pasta, was not only visually striking but also burst with rich flavors of the sea. The ""Polynesian Tribal Grill"" mix showcased succulent meats grilled to perfection, each bite echoing the care and precision akin to the art of tattooing.

As for the service, it was impeccable. The waitstaff, adorned in tasteful body art, were attentive and knowledgeable, explaining the concept with passion and recommending dishes based on our preferences. Their professionalism reiterated the 5-star experience. The highlight of the evening was when the chef, sporting chef's whites with tattoo-inspired motifs, came out to discuss the inspirations behind his dishes.

Cleanliness and attention to detail were evident throughout, from the plating to the pristine condition of the dining area. Moreover, the restaurant had an engaging twist – diners could watch live tattoo sessions occurring in a glass-enclosed studio adjacent to the dining area, which added to the authentic atmosphere without sacrificing the comfort of those eating.

In summary, Body Art Tattoos and Piercings transcended my expectations with its innovative concept, delectable food, and stellar service. Whether you're a foodie or simply in search of a novel dining scene, this is an establishment that’s definitely worth checking out.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I love this rails to trail path.  Most of the time I am riding my bike on the trail between 75th Street and Broad Ripple Ave.  But, I have also taken the trail as far North as Westfield and as far south as 21ish street.  The trail is very well maintained.  It is good for walking, riding, roller blading, running.  It is good for adults, kids, dogs.  

If you are a biker, there will be times where you can get your speed up, but you should also know there are times where you need to ride slower for the safety of the pedestrians.  A bike bell is helpful to let the walkers / runners know you are coming up.  You can also do the ""on your left"" shout.  Many pedestrians will have the head phones on and won't hear you.  However, I find these people to be pretty much focused and going on a straight line path anyway.  But, it is still good to assume they can hear you and give your warning.  

If you are a pedestrian, it would be good to remember that there are bikers coming up behind you and before moving to the other side of the trail, be cautious.

When we all play nicely together, this trail works well.  And, from my experience, everyone on the trail has been playing nicely together.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Tucson International Airport - TUS may not leap to mind when thinking of culinary hotspots, but my recent experience was a delightful surprise, worthy of every one of the five stars I'm awarding it. Amidst the hustle and bustle of travelers, the dining options at TUS offered both a refuge and a burst of local flavor that truly enhanced my airport experience.

From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the warm ambiance that seemed to counter the often cold and sterile airport atmosphere. The staff members at the various eateries were not only attentive but gave off an air of genuine hospitality, indicative of Tucson's friendly culture.

The diversity of food options spoke to TUS's commitment to cater to a wide array of tastes and dietary needs. Whether I craved a hearty, traditional breakfast or a light, health-conscious snack, my cravings were met with high-quality ingredients and artful presentation reminiscent of a dedicated restaurant rather than an airport concession.

The highlight of my dining adventure was a local Southwestern cuisine spot that delivered an imaginative take on regional classics. The flavors were bold, yet balanced, combining traditional spices with contemporary culinary techniques. The prickly pear barbecue sandwich was a standout, with its tender meat complemented by the tangy sweetness of the cactus fruit sauce—a combination I won't soon forget.

TUS didn't neglect my caffeine needs either. The coffee bar served up an aromatic and richly flavored brew that provided the perfect pick-me-up before my flight. Paired with a freshly baked pastry from a nearby kiosk, it was a match made in heaven, setting a new standard for airport coffee experiences.

The ambiance of the dining areas was also noteworthy—a pleasing aesthetic with comfortable seating that offered a reprieve from the usual compact airport chairs. It was clear that someone had thoughtfully considered the environment in which weary travelers would dine, aiming to create an uplifting space that invites relaxation.

In sum, Tucson International Airport - TUS offers a dining experience that surprises and delights, rivaling the offerings of many stand-alone restaurants. For travelers passing through, I heartily recommend allotting extra time to explore and enjoy the fantastic food and drinks available. It's a palate-pleasing oasis in the desert of airport fare.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently visited Bottle Bar East for dinner and overall, it was a decent experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was trendy and modern, with a nice mix of high-top tables and cozy booths. The staff was friendly and welcoming, providing good service throughout the meal.

The menu had a variety of options to choose from, mainly focusing on American comfort food with a twist. I opted for their famous burger, which was cooked to perfection and had a juicy patty. The truffle fries that came with it were a delicious accompaniment. However, I must say that some of the other dishes were underwhelming. The fried chicken lacked flavor, and the vegetarian options were limited and not very innovative.

One of the highlights of dining at Bottle Bar East is their extensive drink selection. They have an impressive array of craft beers, cocktails, and a well-stocked bar. I tried one of their signature cocktails, which was expertly crafted and full of flavor.

While the food and drinks were satisfactory, the prices were a bit on the higher side. Considering the quality of the dishes, I felt that the cost was a bit unreasonable.

One thing that stood out to me was the noise level in the restaurant. It was quite loud, making it difficult to carry a conversation at times, especially during peak hours.

In conclusion, I would rate my experience at Bottle Bar East with 3 stars out of 5. The overall atmosphere and service were pleasant, and the burger and drinks were enjoyable. However, the limited vegetarian options, underwhelming dishes, and high prices were factors that brought down my rating. Nonetheless, it remains a decent spot to grab a drink and enjoy a satisfying burger.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Ninja Noodle - where do I even begin? My dining experience at this restaurant was a complete disappointment from start to finish. I had high hopes for a unique and exciting dining experience, but unfortunately, Ninja Noodle fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, let's address the service. The staff at Ninja Noodle were incredibly rude and inattentive. From the moment I walked through the door, I could tell that the atmosphere was tense and unwelcoming. The host barely acknowledged my presence and seemed annoyed when I asked for a table. Throughout the meal, the waitstaff completely ignored our requests for refills on drinks and extra napkins. Our needs were clearly not a priority to them.

When it comes to the food, I can't say that I was any more impressed. The menu promised an array of flavorful and authentic Asian noodle dishes, but what arrived at our table was far from that. The noodles were overcooked and bland, lacking any depth of flavor. The broth in the soups was watery and lacked the richness that one would expect from a noodle restaurant. To add insult to injury, the portion sizes were ridiculously small, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and hungry.

One of the supposed highlights of Ninja Noodle was the presentation and entertainment provided by the ""ninja"" staff. However, even this aspect fell flat. The so-called ""ninjas"" would occasionally make an appearance, but their acts were unimpressive and lacked any real surprise or excitement. It felt more like a forced gimmick rather than a genuine attempt at creating a unique experience.

The prices at Ninja Noodle were also shockingly high for the quality of food and service received. I wouldn't mind paying extra for a memorable dining experience, but this restaurant failed to deliver on its promises in every aspect. I left feeling not only disappointed but also ripped off.

In conclusion, Ninja Noodle was a major letdown. The rude and inattentive service, subpar food, lackluster entertainment, and overpriced menu all contributed to a dining experience that I would not wish on anyone. I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money here. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that offer delicious and satisfying noodle dishes with much better service. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere for a true dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Charlie Was a Sinner, and I must say it was an absolutely delightful experience. From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the inviting ambiance and sleek decor. The service was exceptional, with friendly staff who were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

Speaking of the menu, it was a true feast for the senses. Charlie Was a Sinner offers a unique vegan dining experience, and I was blown away by the creativity and flavors they presented. Each dish was beautifully presented, showcasing the chef's artistic touch.

I started with the avocado bruschetta, which was a refreshing twist on a classic. The combination of creamy avocado, tangy tomatoes, and crunchy bread was simply divine. For my main course, I opted for the mushroom risotto. The rice was perfectly cooked and infused with rich mushroom flavor, creating a heavenly blend of textures and tastes.

To top it all off, I indulged in their decadent chocolate truffle dessert. It was the perfect ending to an already exquisite meal. The flavors were intense and the presentation was immaculate. Paired with a glass of their recommended vegan wine, it was a match made in heaven.

Overall, my experience at Charlie Was a Sinner was nothing short of extraordinary. The attention to detail, innovative menu, and impeccable service truly set this restaurant apart.

They also have thorough descriptions of their services and list prices, so everything is upfront and straightforward - I really appreciate that.  
Pastel Spa is located in one of those little houses on College Ave in Broad Ripple that have been converted into businesses, its a little sparse on the inside, but very clean.  I walked in for my appointment and I was immediately taken back into a room, I literally had zero wait time, which is great!  
My appointment was with Kady for a Brazilian, a procedure that you may know is painful, and really, is kind of awkward (if you don't know why, google it).  Kady was completely professional and tried her best to put me at ease while she was working.  This wasn't my first Brazilian, so I knew what was coming, but it was probably one of the better ones I've had, because Kady was FAST.  I was done in like 15 minutes, and for me, the faster, the better.  She did a great job, I was very happy with the results.  
They also have a ""waxing club"" - basically you pay 10 dollars to sign up and you get your waxing services at a discount.

The staff at Más Mexicali Cantina was incredibly friendly and attentive. They were quick to seat me and took my order promptly. I was particularly impressed with the level of service provided by the waitstaff.

The food at Más Mexicali Cantina was outstanding. I tried several dishes, including tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas, and each one was bursting with flavor. The ingredients used were fresh and the dishes were cooked to perfection. I especially loved the variety of salsas and toppings available to enhance the flavors even further.

The drink menu at Más Mexicali Cantina was extensive, offering a wide selection of cocktails, tequilas, and margaritas. I must say, their margaritas were on point! The drinks were expertly made and packed a punch of flavor. However, I found that some of the cocktails were a bit too heavy on the sour mix, which slightly impacted their taste. Nonetheless, this was a minor issue in an otherwise exceptional dining experience.

The highlight of my evening at Más Mexicali Cantina was the live music. The band playing that night created a lively and energetic atmosphere, enhancing the overall dining experience. It was incredible to enjoy great food and drinks while listening to fantastic live music.

"Luke's Lobster Rittenhouse left me with a mixed experience. While there were certainly aspects of the visit that I found enjoyable, there were also a few disappointments that prevented me from giving it a higher rating.

Firstly, the atmosphere of the restaurant was quite pleasant. The casual yet sophisticated decor and the cozy seating arrangements created a relaxed and cozy ambiance. The staff members were friendly and attentive, which added to the overall positive vibe.

Moving on to the food, the lobster roll, which is their specialty, was undeniably delicious. The generous chunks of fresh lobster meat were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the buttery roll complemented the seafood beautifully. The flavors were well-balanced, and each bite was a treat for my taste buds. The accompanying coleslaw and pickle added a nice crunch and tanginess to the meal.

However, the menu was somewhat limited, and the options for non-seafood lovers were limited. As someone who prefers a variety of choices, it was disappointing to find that there weren't many alternatives available. Additionally, the prices were on the higher side, considering the portion size. While I understand that seafood can be expensive, the portions felt a bit too small for the cost.

Another issue I encountered was with the wait time. The restaurant appeared to be understaffed, as it took quite a while for our food to arrive. While I appreciated the fact that they were busy, it was frustrating to wait longer than anticipated, especially since we had made a reservation.

Despite these drawbacks, the overall experience at Luke's Lobster Rittenhouse was above average. The exceptional quality of the lobster roll and the cozy atmosphere were definite highlights. However, the limited menu options, high prices, and slow service prevented me from fully enjoying my visit.

In conclusion, Luke's Lobster Rittenhouse is a decent option for seafood lovers seeking a satisfying lobster roll in a cozy setting. If you're willing to pay a premium for quality seafood, you won't be disappointed. However, for those looking for a broader menu or faster service, there may be better options available in the area.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

This is why I don't order them other places and was so happy to find a place that served them right.  Now I'm concerned about here.  If this is going to be one of your signature dishes, you  need to keep someone who knows how to fry them.

The cocktails were good as usual and the tortilla soup was excellent.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At Datz, every bite is an adventure in flavor and creativity! From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was greeted with an enthusiastic welcome that set the tone for a truly exceptional dining experience. The interiors are eclectically adorned, fusing modern chic with quirky charisma, making each corner of the space Instagram-worthy.

The menu is a treasure trove of innovative comfort food. For starters, I indulged in their deviled eggs trio, each with its own distinctive twist—it was a delightful prelude to the main course. I had heard raves about their signature stuffed meatloaf, and it exceeded my expectations. Layered with cheesy goodness and wrapped in a crispy bacon hug, each forkful was a mouthful of heaven.

The staff deserves a standing ovation for their attentive, yet not overbearing service, blending professionalism with genuine warmth. They exhibited profound knowledge of the menu, assisting with recommendations that were spot on.

What made an indelible impression was Datz's dedication to pleasing the palate while fostering a convivial atmosphere. Whether nestled indoors among the charming décor or basking in the outdoor seating that captures the vibrancy of the neighborhood, the ambiance is nothing short of enchanting.

As a finishing touch, the dessert—a salted caramel chocolate cake—was the perfect sweet note to conclude a flawless meal. In short, Datz didn't just serve food; they curated an experience that was an absolute treat for all the senses. Culinary magic, delightful ambiance, and top-tier service earn Datz a shining five-star rating!",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"The Melting Pot offers a distinctive dining experience that revolves around the communal activity of dipping and sharing. While the novelty of fondue can be a draw, my experience was a mixed bag, meriting a solid three-star rating. 

The evening began with an appetizer cheese fondue which was enjoyable, but unfortunately lacked the depth of flavor I anticipated. The assortment of bread and vegetables for dipping was fresh and complementary to the rich cheese, but didn't quite live up to the expectations set by the menu descriptions. 

The main course featured a variety of meats and vegetables to be cooked tableside in a shared pot. This interactive form of dining encourages conversation and a bit of fun, yet the quality of some ingredients seemed lackluster. Additionally, the sauces provided, while varied, were hit-or-miss in terms of flavor pairing and appeal. 

Service was attentive without being overbearing, and the ambiance of The Melting Pot was cozy and well-suited for a casual date night or a small group celebration. The dessert course, a chocolate fondue, was the highlight. Rich and decadent, it paired wonderfully with the fresh fruit and marshmallows for dipping.

In conclusion, while the chocolate fondue was a redemption, the overall experience didn't quite justify the premium price point. The Melting Pot offers a fun experience, yet it could benefit from refining its offerings to match the enchanting potential of a night spent around a melting pot of delightful tastes.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"My review will be a tad bit one sided because my first visit was on a whim for the turducken croissant specialty. However, I will be returning for more treats. 

Beautiful shop. The decor and the display cases are all arranged with loving care and definitely bump up the atmosphere to a sophisticated level. 

My fellow foodies and I stood outside in the cold anticipating the open sign and did our best not to drool once the door opened. The smell wafting through the air is enough to cause a riot but we all behaved ourselves and queued up for the turducken experience. Standing in line taunted us all with the other glorious treats, sweet and savory, which were on display, but I resisted. 
The staff was so friendly and helpful and quickly moved through the crowd which had gathered. 

The turducken croissant.  Okay I know sometimes you wait in line for a ""specialty"" because it is part of the experience and try not to be let down on the actual item. The turducken croissant is special. A perfectly soft and flaky croissant stuffed with a turkey/duck/dressing/cranberry mixture you can dip in a side of gravy. Dear lord it was decadent.

"Dr. Dean at Crossroads is one of the best doctors I've ever been to in my entire 30 years of life.  She's very aware of how sensitive annual exams can be.  She knows exactly how to take the stress out of the stressful situation because she's very personable and a very happy, upbeat person.  She talks to you like a person, not like a sterile doctor.  Not only does she exam the lady bits, but she also makes sure you're ok overall.  Not all doctors will do this, they just take care of what their specialty dictates.  I really appreciate that I can go to her and know that I'm also getting a decent physical exam, too.  

The office is usually pretty good about timing, unless you go near a holiday, apparently.  But even then, they were only about 20-30 minutes behind schedule.  The scheduling staff can be a little curt.  Neither of these issues are enough for me to pull down Dr. Dean's rating -- she's that good.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"It's not every day you dine at a place called Speedy Lube & Auto Care, but surprise—it’s a diner. With its unorthodox name, you'd expect a confusing experience, but the automotive theme brought a quirky charm to the setting. The décor was reminiscent of a retro garage, a novel backdrop for dining.

Service was a bit slow despite the name, with wait times more akin to a leisurely tune-up than a pit-stop. The staff, clad in mechanic-style uniforms, were friendly but seemed to be juggling too many tables, leading to occasional lapses in attentiveness.

The menu, an eclectic mix of classic diner fare and automotive puns, offered 'brake-fast’ specials and 'lubricated' burgers. My 'Tire Rotation' roast beef sandwich was flavorful, if a little greasy, and reasonably priced. However, the 'Coolant' milkshake, while creative in concept, fell short on actual taste—lacking the richness one craves in a creamy dessert.

Overall, Speedy Lube is worth a pit-stop for the ambiance and novelty, yet, it doesn't quite race to the front of the pack in culinary prowess. It's a solid 3-star experience: not fully high-octane, but not just running on fumes either.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Ball park Village.... When you first came into our lives you were oh so shiny and new... Now that shine has just gotten a little dull, making you ready for a new updated review.. Not that I don't enjoy you from time to time, but I just don't feel the same. 

SO the good... I love that they have cheap concerts here. I have seen 4 or 5 country concerts here for like 15 bucks! What a deal! And I also got to see Taking Back Sunday, and that was only like 12 dollars. The concerts and events are great. I totally love coming to watch Cardinal and Blues games here when it's playoff time. YES... it's crowded... but its MUCH cheaper than going to the actual game, and you still get the good time of it. I enjoy being downtown when our teams are in the playoffs. The building itself is pretty impressive... the concept of BPV is great...

But the bad... Well.... simply put, it's crowded, overpriced, and a little crazy. Am I sounding a little old when I say I would rather go to a hole in the wall local bar over drinking and riding the mechanical bull at PBR? Well, it's true folks. Not that I don't like to go out and have a little fun, but I just feel like, this is a spot if you're in the mood to get a little crazy... If not, you might just be a little annoyed because it's going to be loud music, packed, and everyone is a little rowdy. It totally has had an impact for the small local business owners. They are not getting as much of the before and after games business.

Today their technician Heath S. showed up on time

There was no charges for the visit today and I'm still enthusiastic about a company that takes care of their customers so well.  

I asked Heath about Frog and how they take care of the employees, he ensured me that they not only care about their customers, but also care about their employees, I could tell that he was happy to be working for a great company.

"We arrived promptly for our reservation. Carmine the owner showed up. My friend knew him. I was treating my long time buddy and his family as a thank you for having me visit and stay with them.

The place is a classic steakhouse with an Italian tilt. A nice looking, crowded bar on the left as you enter and a full dining room ahead and on the right. It was a Tuesday around 7pm. 

We were seated promptly but no one came by to welcome us or get water, etc. after 15 mins I got up and asked the hostess what was going on. She got a waiter and bus boy to us immediately and things began to get back on track. Our waiter seemed new but he was trying really hard and we thought he was good after a rough start.

We ordered some house wine. The cab was surprisingly good.

Steaks were great. I had an 8 ounce prime filet medium rare it was perfect. My friend also got a filet with Gorgonzola over top. He loved it. His wife ordered a salmon and their son got a chicken parmigiana. The food was very good.  We also had salads and pasta sides. 

Value was pretty good as well. We were comped a round of drinks, ~$28 for our trouble with the initial service. That was nice. Total was $187 not including tip. 

We all enjoyed the place and would return.

"This place is awesome! Great food, great service.... small restaurant in a strip mall but you really get a lot of food for the price, and it's very delicious. I have tried their lunch buffet once just to get a feel for the various offerings. My favorite dish is the chicken korma which I continue to order as take-out.The naan bread is fantastic! The rice is delicious too, esp their egg rice. Not sure what the word for that is... but it has eggs in it and it was on their lunch buffet. I didn't quite like the chicken tikka masala as much as other places' but it's still not bad. The korma is so friggin' good though. I get mine with chicken but I would like to try other kinds too. My mouth is watering as I type this... caution - don't write stuff on Yelp when hungry - you might lose your mind!  Oh also, their raita yogurt stuff is pretty good too...it manages to calm the storm that is my stomach after eating even the mildest mild curry. I have issues with spicy food in general so I can't eat Indian food or anything slightly spicy unless I take the proper precautions beforehand. E.g. lots of different types of medicine. But it's so worth it. SOOO worth it. OK time to get some korma, LOL. I would give them a 5th star if they delivered or had some agreement with grubhub to deliver... sometimes I am too exhausted to drive anywhere or incapacitated, so that would be an awesome bonus. But I really can't complain as it's fairly close to home. The next closest Indian restaurant is either Midrivers or somewhere across the bridge off the Rock Road.

"Shrimpys Blues Bistro exceeded all of my expectations and delivered an exceptional dining experience. From the moment I walked through the door, the warm and cozy ambiance instantly made me feel welcome. The decor, with its rustic bluesy vibe, perfectly complemented the overall atmosphere.

The service was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff who went above and beyond to cater to my needs. The menu featured an array of mouthwatering seafood dishes, and I decided to indulge in their signature shrimp platter. The dish arrived beautifully presented and packed with flavor. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and every bite was a delight to my taste buds.

The bistro also offered an impressive selection of cocktails and drinks. I opted for their specialty blue margarita, and it was the perfect blend of tangy and refreshing. The bartenders demonstrated their skill in mixing drinks, and the creativity behind each concoction was evident.

What truly made my experience stand out was the live blues music that filled the air. The talented singer and band provided a soulful and lively backdrop, which added an extra layer of enjoyment to my evening. It was evident that the establishment truly embraced the blues theme.

Overall, I cannot recommend Shrimpys Blues Bistro enough. The combination of delectable seafood, friendly service, vibrant atmosphere, and live music created a truly memorable dining experience.

I choose this location because they were SO much cheaper than the airport BUT they have s small sign that says they charge you for the airport fees and taxes.... WHY I am not the airport??? They do not offer pickup which means a taxi expense.

Side note.... Lyft is not allowed to pick up from the airport but there is a work around. Don't put in MSY - airport code or you will get rejected but instead put in the actual airport address and then call your driver for a specifics pick up location.

I read the reviews, this place is a nice alternative from the normal date type fare.

I went online and made reservations, you can use debit or credit. I received a response shortly after submitting the booking request.

The staff sends you reminders once you book, the closer you get to your reservation window.

COVID-19 precautions are practiced here. All of the equipment is sterilized, after use. So its clean when it's your turn to put the gear on. Since the VR goggles are worn on your face, you are given a disposable mask to put on that sits between your VR goggles and your face. The goggles never touch your face. 

There are several choices of games to pick from. Ranging from Easy to Hard. My wife and I had never played VR type games before.

"Mandina's Restaurant is an absolute gem in the heart of New Orleans. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed with the warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff greeted me with a friendly smile and made me feel right at home.

The menu at Mandina's is a perfect blend of Italian and Cajun specialties. I started my meal with the garlic butter crab fingers, and they were absolutely mouthwatering. The combination of flavors was simply divine. For our main courses, we tried the etouffee, eggplant Parmesan, and chicken parm. Each dish was bursting with flavor and portion sizes were incredibly generous. We left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied and couldn't even think about dessert.

The standout dish of the evening was the turtle soup. I have had turtle soup at some of the best restaurants in New Orleans, including Commander's Palace, and Mandina's version rivals them all. The rich and flavorful broth, combined with tender turtle meat, created a truly memorable experience.

While the fried seafood was good, the shrimp etouffee I had on a previous visit was just average. However, this minor disappointment was overshadowed by the overall excellence of the meal.

Mandina's Restaurant is a true local gem that should not be missed. The food, the atmosphere, and the friendly staff all contribute to a wonderful dining experience.

"Thunder Canyon Brewery truly exceeded all expectations, earning itself a well-deserved five-star review. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in a cozy yet vibrant atmosphere that set the stage for an exceptional dining experience.

The menu was an impressive amalgamation of classic pub cuisine and inventive culinary delights, leaving me spoilt for choice. I started with their house-made pretzel, which arrived warm, with a perfectly golden crust yielding to a delightfully chewy interior, accompanied by a robust beer cheese dip that was a harmonious blend of flavors.

For my main course, the brewery's signature ale-battered fish and chips caught my eye, and it did not disappoint. The fish was encased in a light, crispy batter that complemented the flaky, moist whitefish beautifully. Accompanying the dish was a tangy house-made tartar sauce and a heaping portion of fries that were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

As a brewery, Thunder Canyon did not let down on the beer front, either. Each brew I sampled was a testament to the craftsmanship of their in-house brewmasters—their IPA was particularly notable, with just the right balance of hoppy bitterness and citrusy notes.

Service throughout the evening was attentive and personable, adding a warm and welcoming touch to the whole experience. The waitstaff was knowledgeable about both the food and drink menus, offering suggestions tailored to my tastes.

Thunder Canyon Brewery is not just a restaurant; it's a destination for those who appreciate exceptional food, expertly crafted beer, and an atmosphere that embraces you like an old friend. Hands down, it's a five-star experience not to be missed.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"My visit to Charlie's Seafood left me underwhelmed, reflected by a 2-star rating. Although the allure of a seaside dining spot was compelling, the reality didn't match the expectation. Our greeting wasn't as warm as hoped, tinged with an air of indifference that set the tone for the service to come. We were seated at a worn table with a view, but the charm ended there.

The menu promised a dazzling array of ocean treasures, yet multiple items were conspicuously absent when we attempted to order—disappointing for a place that touts variety as a selling point. I settled on the grilled halibut which was, regrettably, overcooked and bland, lacking the culinary finesse one anticipates from a specialized seafood restaurant. Accompaniments were equally lackluster, masking their lack of freshness with an overzealous dash of salt.

The final letdown was the pacing of the meal; the dishes arrived at awkward intervals, disrupting the flow of our dining experience.

In summary, Charlie's Seafood has the potential for a delightful seafood experience but falls dramatically short. Without major improvements in both food quality and customer service, I'm hard-pressed to foresee a return visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The drinks are all non-alcoholic due to their lack of a liquor license. BUT they let you BYOB which is way better than a liquor license anyway IMO. 

Now for the food. Ooooooo the food! Now, normally I would wait to review until I've had a few different items on the menu. BUT I couldn't go another day without giving credit where credit is due.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Mama's Vegetarian and overall, it was a great experience. I decided to try the original large Mama's falafel sandwich after hearing so much about it, and while it was tasty, I feel like I didn't fully get to appreciate the fresh, light, and crispy falafel that my roommate always raved about. Unfortunately, we arrived towards closing time, so the falafel wasn't being made as regularly and we had to take our food to go. My advice would be to try and visit during busier hours or lunchtime and eat in-house for the full experience.

One highlight of the restaurant was their amazing pickle bar. They offer a variety of sweet and spicy toppings for your food, such as pickled vegetables, jalapeños, pineapples, and grapes. There truly is something for everyone at Mama's Vegetarian.

However, the real star of the show was the hummus. With so much competition in Philly for hummus, I can confidently say that Mama's Vegetarian ranks among my favorites. The hummus was creamy, flavorful, and perfectly paired with their warm pita bread.

It's worth noting that Mama's Vegetarian is cash only, so make sure to bring some extra bills. Overall, I would highly recommend Mama's Vegetarian for anyone looking for a delicious vegetarian meal in a casual setting. I give it 4 stars out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"This place is like the chipotle of pizza!! What a great concept of build your own pizzas. They do have a few ""regular"" options for go to's or you can fully build your own. They have 2 types of crust a thinner and a ""high rise"" thicker crust. They slide it in a pizza oven and off it goes to cook. The veggies, the dough, all the meats are extremely fresh and you just can't get any better than a true pizza oven. Great sauce selection and plenty of seating. Very clean area and a fun soda, tea, and juice selection. 

The only reason for the 4 starts is how slow the workers were. We luckily were first in line but as we stood there 4 people joined behind and by the time we were finished eating the 4th person still hadn't received their food. Not good multi taskers and the just take their time. Don't be in any hurry. But very nice and kind staff, just painfully slow. * not talking about the cook time of the pizza but the service of building and paying with one or two people helping. They need to follow Chipotle's model.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"When stepping into Francoluigi's Pizzeria & Italian Restaurant, one is greeted by a warm, family-friendly atmosphere that promises an authentic Italian dining experience. The waitstaff was noticeably busy, yet they remained courteous throughout the evening. Aromas from the kitchen hinted at traditional culinary craftsmanship, fueling anticipation for the meal ahead.

The starter - freshly baked garlic knots - set a comforting tone, soft, warm, and fragrant. However, the marinara sauce accompanying them was unremarkable, lacking that vibrant tomato freshness one craves with Italian fare.

My main course, a classic Margherita pizza, arrived aesthetically pleasing with a promising blistered crust. Although the toppings were fresh and flavorful, the pizza's base was disappointingly doughy, not quite achieving the crispness aspired by the Neapolitan standard.

I opted for a slice of tiramisu to round off the meal, which, while creamy, missed that robust coffee and cocoa punch that typifies the dessert. It was pleasant, nonetheless.

In terms of ambience, the restaurant's decor captivated with its nods to Italy, yet the acoustics of the space made for a rather noisy background, somewhat diminishing the overall dining pleasure.

In conclusion, Francoluigi's offers a slice of Italy with genuine intent but falls short on some culinary aspects. Perfect for a casual night out, it may not satiate those seeking an impeccable Italian dining experience. A solid three-star outing; Francoluigi's has room to refine and elevate what could be an enchanting escape into Italian cuisine.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Restaurant Review: The Company Burger

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

My recent experience at The Company Burger left me feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. From the moment I walked through the doors, I couldn't help but notice the lack of attention to detail and overall poor quality of service.

First, let's talk about the ambiance. The restaurant seemed cramped and poorly designed, with tables placed too close together and no separate areas for diners to enjoy their meals in privacy. The noise level was deafening, making it impossible to have a decent conversation with my dining companions. The lighting was dim, adding to the overall gloomy atmosphere.

Moving on to the service, I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the lack of warmth and attentiveness from the staff. Not once did I receive a genuine smile or a friendly welcome. It felt as if I was just another customer, rather than a valued guest. Our server seemed disinterested and rushed, making us feel like an inconvenience. Throughout the meal, it was a challenge to flag someone down for assistance or to address any issues we encountered.

Now let's talk about the main event – the food. Despite the restaurant's name, the burgers fell far short of expectations. The patty itself was dry and lacked flavor, almost as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The bun was stale and tasted as though it had been left out for too long. The toppings were lackluster, with a sparse amount of lettuce, tomato, and onion that failed to add any excitement to the overall taste. The fries accompanying the burger were overcooked and lacked any hint of seasoning. I had high hopes for the signature burger at The Company Burger, but it sadly did not deliver.

To add insult to injury, the prices at The Company Burger were unreasonably high for the quality of food and service provided. I found myself questioning the value of what was being offered and felt that I could have had a much better dining experience elsewhere for the same amount spent.

Overall, my experience at The Company Burger was incredibly disappointing. From the underwhelming burgers to the lackluster service and uninviting ambiance, this restaurant failed to live up to its name. I would strongly caution anyone considering dining here to look elsewhere for a more satisfying and enjoyable meal.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Riverwinds Restaurant was a disappointing experience. The location by the Delaware River provided a nice view, but that was the only positive. The server was friendly, and the Asian Tuna Tartar and Calamari were good. However, the salad course was forgotten and arrived late. The biggest issue was that our entrees were served cold and inedible. Three of us sent our food back, but by then I had lost my appetite. The head waiter addressed our concerns, but it was too late. The general manager tried to make up for it, but the damage was done. With the high price tag, I expected a much better experience. Sadly, I won't be returning.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"East Nashville Beer Works is a fantastic spot for beer lovers and families alike. The space is impressive, both inside and out, with plenty of room to relax and enjoy yourself. I had a great time trying their IPA, which was delicious, and the pizza exceeded my expectations for brewery food. I especially loved the deck and grassy area for playing games like corn hole. 

However, my only gripe is that they don't offer free beer samples. While they suggest flights, sometimes you just want to try a small sample before committing to a full glass. It would be great if they could make this change and allow guests to taste their beers. Despite this, East Nashville Beer Works still ranks high on my list of favorite breweries in the area, along with Smith & Lentz and Southern Grist. I can't wait to visit again, although parking can be a challenge during busy events. Overall, a great experience at East Nashville Beer Works!",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Please save yourself the time, money and heartache and do not order from this location. This Edible Arrangements location has absolutely zero attention to detail, terrible customer service and no empathy whatsoever.

A friend of mine kindly sent over an Edible Arrangements delivery as a sympathy gift for a death in my the family. Unfortunately, no one was home on the original date of delivery and the delivery driver called me to follow up. I explained that everyone was at the viewing and we agreed on a day in which someone would be able to accept the delivery, however, the day came and went and nothing was delivered. 

I called this Blue Bell location at least 5+ times since that day and over the course of the week during their listed working hours but was met with their ""we're closed"" automated message every. single. time.

Finally I get a real person picking up the line today (mind you, in the middle of the automated ""we're closed"" message) and they proceed to tell me they were waiting on me to call them back.

It's been one full week since your initial attempted delivery and you're waiting on ME to get back to YOU? There were zero follow ups nor apologies to the lack of delivery. What kind of customer service is this? Absolutely abhorrent. 

I asked if the original purchaser would be able to obtain a refund for this instead of having it delivered and they stated no refund would be given since the arrangement was already ""out"" for delivery once. So they made me pick a pick a date for delivery but gave no insight as to delivery times in any way whatsoever.

So in conclusion, they're not going to give my friend a refund despite being more than a week late and they're also going to deliver this going on 9 day old edible arrangement which will undoubtedly end up in the trash anyway.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Restaurant Name: Murph's Bar
Rating: ★★★★★

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Murph's Bar and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted with a weird but charming vibe. The decor, while tacky, added to the unique atmosphere of this Irish dive bar.

However, the real star of the show here is the authentic Italian cuisine. The menu is extensive, offering a wide range of mouthwatering options. I started with the fired burrata, which was an absolute delight. The warm, crunchy texture was the perfect introduction to what awaited me.

Based on the bartender's recommendation, I decided to try the stuffed manicotti, and I also ordered a truffle pasta dish to savor a different sauce. Both dishes were simply amazing. The flavors were bold and tantalizing, leaving me wanting more. The accompanying bread was a thoughtful touch, allowing me to soak up every last drop of sauce. I couldn't resist picking up the plate and licking it clean, as I didn't want to leave a single morsel behind.

Murph's Bar is a must-try for any food enthusiast, and it has truly become a staple in my dining choices. As a local resident, I am excited to make this place a regular stop on my culinary adventures, even if it means keeping an eye on my pants size. The Italian food here is truly exceptional.

The food was the highlight of my experience at Murph's Bar. I opted for the gnocchi with tomatoes and mozzarella, being a huge fan of this dish. It exceeded all expectations. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, and the combination of flavors was simply divine.

Not only did I enjoy my own dish, but I also had the opportunity to try some of my friends' selections. The manicotti with crab and the pasta with white sauce were both outstanding. We couldn't stop raving about how delicious they were.

While it is undeniable that Murph's Bar has a strong Irish pub influence, the quality of the Italian food cannot be ignored. This is, without a doubt, the best Italian restaurant I have been to in quite a while.

If you plan on dining at Murph's Bar, I highly recommend making a reservation. This place is bound to be popular, and you don't want to miss out on an incredible culinary experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"There's not much else to be said here, so I'll comment where I felt things were lacking. But, before I make any comments, I will say that the musuem's contents, overall, were pretty interesting. I normally don't feel sick while looking at things in a museum, but at times I was put over the edge and had to look away (e.g. wax model of a horn coming out of someone's head).

The educational value of this museum is in the fact that medical science during the 18th and 19th Century was based mostly on visual study of the maladies. There wasn't much that could be done other than that. Therefore, viewing this museum as a window into the past was very effective.

It is clear why as of January 2008 they are looking for a new director and it can be seen in the exhibits. The newest room, located in the basement, was installed in 2004 and it shows. Exhibits are well lit, the display placards are fresh looking and descriptive, and the exhibits are arranged well.

However, the rest of the museum has fading placards, pealing away from their dried out glue backings. Some even rest slightly askew in the display or lean against their adjacent exhibit. And the more ""current"" exhibit on infectious disease (or modern plagues and disease) is out-dated at over 15 years old (citations about George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton (first-term).)

The gift shop sold silly trinkets and really lacked in the way of decent postcards for people to buy.

With a little bit of direction, this museum could be a first-rate attraction. As it stands right now, at $16 for an adult, that is a steep fee to pay. Although, I didn't feel that it was a waste like when I went to the Franklin Institute of (pseudo) Science.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Restaurant Name: Nesso
Rating: 4 stars out of 5

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Nesso, an upscale Italian restaurant located in the heart of the city. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with an inviting atmosphere and a warm ambiance.

The menu at Nesso is truly progressive, offering a wide variety of dishes that are a departure from the traditional family-style Italian restaurants in the area. Instead of large portions, Nesso offers smaller, more refined plates that are bursting with flavor. This concept allows diners to try a multitude of dishes without feeling overwhelmed.

One thing that truly impressed me about Nesso was their admirable wine selection. The restaurant had an extensive variety of reasonably priced bottles, as well as some truly exquisite high-end options. Whether you're a wine connoisseur or simply looking to pair your meal with a great glass of vino, Nesso has got you covered.

In terms of service, Nesso exceeded all expectations. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, striking the perfect balance between being present and giving us space to enjoy our meal. What really stood out was that despite the upscale nature of the establishment, there was no pressure to order every course or indulge in expensive extras. The staff at Nesso genuinely seemed focused on providing a memorable dining experience for their guests.

While I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nesso, there were a few minor aspects that prevented me from giving it a full 5-star rating. The prices were higher than average, which might deter some diners on a tighter budget. Additionally, the portions, although delicious, were on the smaller side, which left me craving a bit more.

All in all, Nesso is an exceptional Italian restaurant that offers a unique dining experience. With its progressive menu, superb wine selection, and attentive service, it is definitely worth a visit for those seeking a refined culinary adventure.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Casa Video was a delightful dining experience that left me feeling satisfied and eager to return. The restaurant's cozy and welcoming ambiance instantly drew me in, making me feel right at home. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was enjoyable from beginning to end.

The menu at Casa Video was diverse and catered to a variety of tastes. From their signature tacos to perfectly cooked fajitas, each dish was bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. The portions were generous, allowing me to indulge in the delicious flavors without feeling overly stuffed.

One standout dish for me was their mouth-watering carne asada tacos. The tender and flavorsome beef paired perfectly with the soft tortillas and fresh toppings, creating a culinary delight. I also couldn't resist trying their creamy guacamole, which was made fresh to order and had just the right balance of flavors.

The service at Casa Video was impeccable, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was memorable. They were knowledgeable about the menu, offering recommendations and answering any questions I had. Additionally, the food was served promptly and presented beautifully, further enhancing the overall experience.

The only aspect that slightly detracted from my experience was the noise level at times. As the restaurant filled up, the chatter and music became slightly overwhelming, making it difficult to hold a conversation. However, this did not overshadow the overall positive experience I had at Casa Video.

In conclusion, Casa Video is a restaurant that I would highly recommend to anyone in search of delicious Mexican cuisine in a warm and inviting atmosphere. With its delectable dishes, friendly staff, and cozy ambiance, it truly exceeded my expectations.

"If you're looking for another local brunch spot in the Tampa Bay area, this is the place to be! Now Datz is pretty popular so don't be alarmed when you get there and they give you an estimated weight of 30 minutes to an hour.

I've been here twice and I got Benedicts because if you know me, that's pretty much all I order it when I go out for brunch. And needless to say this place did not disappoint.

Bottom Line: They do not welcome or greet customers in even the most basic sense.

We went to El Jefe's anxious to try it, 4 of us on Saturday, March 18 around 7:00PM. We waited for a host or hostess to guide us if it was ""seat yourself"" or wait to be seated. After several minutes, a young lady came out and said she was not taking any more names for the waiting list....that she was the kitchen manager and she was ""calling it"". What was boggling is that the restaurant was not full. We did not see anyone else waiting. But actually, what is most mind boggling is that she did not greet us in any sense of the word, guide us where else we might go, apologize that they are short-staffed and wouldn't be able to offer service to their standards (you get my drift).

"We sailed on the Calypso Queen on a Saturday night with our friends. The evening cruise was sold out so we anticipated a packed boat. We wondered if/how they would handle the dinner buffet with COVID and the Delta variant. Similar to other reviews, you sail on the Calypso Queen for an entertaining evening with friends (old and new met on the boat!), with great views and not for the food. 

They assign tables so if you are going with friends, make sure you specify that upfront so you can sit together. When we boarded, we found our table and went to the top deck to take in the views. They really wanted us to stay at our seats as they start dismissing tables for the buffet line shortly after departing. We complied and that was a good thing as we were some of the first tables directed to get our food. They didn't do anything different with food handling as a result of COVID. Everyone was serving themselves at the buffet with the same serving utensils. The food itself was fine, but nothing spectacular. Our group paid the extra for the all-you-can-drink of beer, wine, and rum punch. We all enjoyed a cup of rum punch when we boarded as we were greeted by our server that way. It was pretty bland and no detectable sign of rum so we all switched to the bottled beer or wine after that.

One benefit of eating right away had us able to go out on one of the observation decks and take in the sunset. We anticipated going out further in the Gulf, so we were surprised the boat turned around before we ever got out to the formal gulf. The rest of the cruise was along the inter coastal which was likely a good call to keep the boat movement to more of a minimum. 

The boat was filled with different groups celebrating different events - wedding, birthday - or just time together. That added to the festive atmosphere  as dance music was playing throughout on all decks inside and out. The Calypso Queen gave our group of 8 an entertaining way to be together, enjoy the sunset, and be on the water.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"My latest gastronomic escapade led me to the vibrant, always-bustling Taco Bell. The fast food giant is renowned for its lively twist on Mexican-inspired cuisine and this experience did not disappoint. The ambiance, typical of a Taco Bell, was infused with vivid colors and an energetic vibe that coaxes a casual, relaxed dining experience.

The service was unexpectedly commendable compared to the general fast food industry standards. Employees presented a cheerful demeanor and orders were taken with a smile. Despite a moderate queue, the wait time was minimal—my order arrived promptly and was accurate, much to my relief and satisfaction.

What really stood out were the menu items that retained the essence of Taco Bell's tried and true recipes with a touch of modern innovation. The crunchiness of the tacos juxtaposed against the succulent seasoned beef delivers a satisfying texture and flavor with every bite. The burritos were packed with a generous amount of fillings, wrapped tightly to avoid any potential mishaps while enjoying the indulgence. 

Although the flavors were on par as expected, the dining area could use slightly more attention in terms of cleanliness. This was a minor drawback in an otherwise enjoyable visit. 

In essence, Taco Bell continues to hold its place as a go-to spot for quick, flavorful, and affordable Tex-Mex offerings.

They made excellent recommendations and were quick to address any request or question we had. It's clear that the entire team takes great pride in providing exceptional hospitality.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the sushi. Each piece was a work of art, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The fish was incredibly fresh and the chef's attention to detail was evident in every bite. Whether it was the melt-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi or the delicately rolled California roll, each dish was a true culinary masterpiece.

Engimono Sushi also offers a wide variety of other Japanese dishes, including tempura and teriyaki. We couldn't resist trying the miso soup and it was the perfect way to start our meal. The flavors were rich and comforting, and the portion size was generous.

To wash it all down, we indulged in a couple of their signature cocktails. The mixologists at Engimono Sushi know their craft well, as each drink was expertly balanced and packed a punch of unique flavors.

Even the coffee, a standard sidekick to any donut, was bitter and uninviting. The premium prices certainly were not reflective of the quality received.

"Went here for lunch after seeing a review saying this was legit shawarma.  Verdict: it's ok, but not the best I've had.  That greatness goes to Max's Kosher Cafe in Silver Spring Maryland.  Legitimacy in the shawarma world means seeing that lamb meat on a vertical spit and all that awesomeness.  It also means the plethora of toppings, fresh and pickled, and variety or sauces that make you beg for more.

This isn't that place.  It's ok.  it'll fill a craving some.  The lamb was tender, but not succulent.  The motabel (eggplant / tahini sauce) was pretty good.  Served with salad, so nothing special there.  No pickled or fresh toppings.

The sauteed mushroom appetizer was ok, but a little dry.  When I think sauteed mushrooms, I think juicy and savory.  Cucumber sauce is impossible to do wrong.

Talking with people around town, the overall impression is it's ok, but not great.  My Jordanian friend said it wasn't that good for Jordanian cuisine.

"I recently visited New Orleans Lakefront Airport for a dining experience that was, in parts, as intriguing as the location itself. Nestled amidst a backdrop of sleek planes and open skies, the venue encapsulates a unique blend of history and landscape. However, my culinary journey did not quite ascend to great heights.

The ambiance was the first to welcome me, with its elegant art deco features and expansive windows that frame the bustling activity of the runway. It's a view that could whisk any diner's imagination to the glamour of vintage travel. Sadly, the service did not complement the grandeur of the surroundings. The staff was pleasant but seemed disengaged, leaving me to chase down basics like water refills and a check at the end of my meal.

Turning to the menu, it offered an array of dishes that promised a taste of Southern comfort. Yet, some dishes like the shrimp po'boy, while hearty, lacked the depth of flavor I anticipated. The étouffée featured a generous portion of crawfish but was sadly marred by a lack of seasoning that left it slightly underwhelming. 

On the more positive side, the crab cakes served as a delight with the perfect crisp exterior giving way to a succulent blend of meat and spices. And while the cocktails boasted local flair and creativity, the execution fell within the realms of mediocrity. 

In sum, the New Orleans Lakefront Airport restaurant lands solidly as a middle-of-the-runway establishment — with glimpses of promise that could soar with a bit more attention to culinary detail and service dynamics.

Upon entering Noon Mediterranean, I was instantly enamored by the cozy ambiance, tastefully accentuating its cultural roots with modern touches. The staff greeted me with warm smiles and immense knowledge of their menu, guiding me through their delectable offerings and ensuring my experience was tailored to my taste.

The menu is a masterpiece of flavors, offering a create-your-own meal that tantalizes the taste buds. I chose a quinoa base, a grain that was cooked to perfection, balancing nuttiness and fluffiness. For protein, the grilled lamb, succulent and richly seasoned with herbs and spices, melted in my mouth—a true testament to the chef's prowess.

The unlimited toppings are where Noon Mediterranean shines; fresh, vibrant, and incredibly diverse. My selections included roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, and sumptuous feta cheese, each component adding a unique layer of flavor and texture that harmonized beautifully with the meal. The Tzatziki and Harissa sauces provided a cooling complement and a fiery kick, respectively, elevating the dish to celestial heights.

Moreover, the side of warm pita bread, pillowy and fresh out of the oven, was the perfect vehicle to scoop up every delightful morsel. For drinks, the homemade mint lemonade was refreshing, offering a balance of zesty and sweet, an ideal pairing for the rich meal.

The attention to detail, the precision of flavors, and the impeccable service at Noon Mediterranean have set a new standard for me.

"Before heading to New Orleans for the weekend, we learned about the Sunday Gospel brunch and ordered tickets.  What a fun experience.  The performers were entertaining and they even invited numerous people from the crowd on stage making it very interactive.  The Sunday morning we were there, a large family with kids who played in a Jazz band from AZ were too, so the son got up and played the drums, the mom and other son sang, and watching their family's reaction in the crowd was just as entertaining as the show.  The actual HoB is a great facility, large patio, restaurant area, then into the actual stage area with two levels.  We were up on the balcony right next to the stage, so we had great seats.  As far as the brunch went, the food was good, and the server came around with the bottomless mimosas often.  Looking around towards the end of the show, there was tons of food left in the buffet lines so I really hope they donate that food after the show so it didn't go to waste.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I love this place. I only go to Starbucks because few other coffee shops offer frappuccino like beverages or if they offer it, it's not good quality. Coffee Speaks is one of the few places that knows how to make a properly blended frappuccino that matches Starbucks quality. Theirs is called a frappa freeze and their flavors are also more creative. The frapp isn't watery or too icey, it is juuuusssttt right. I've a had few different ones: oreo, s'mores, snickers, etc. 

The only other thing that I've had is the blood orange lemonade slush. It is sweet and not too sour. I drank most of it later after purchasing it, when it was no longer slushy and it is just lemonade. It was still good and did not taste watered down even though it had been sitting in my fridge for hours. 

This place definitely has a cool vibe. I've sat in here with my friend to chat and my drink was given to me in a real cup rather than plastic. I'm certain when the pandemic is over this will be a place I'll want to socialize & hang out more. They feature different art on the walls of local artists that is for sale. The art changes so it's also like a mini gallery trip every time I go.

I've always had friendly service, no matter who helped me and no matter what time of day. Sometimes it may take a little longer if you go when others are there, but it's not an abnormal wait. It's a small business and typically only 1 employee is working at a time.

"Ok I absolutely love Target and between this one and the one down on Gandy I do prefer to come to this Target. It seems like the layout of this one flows so much better and it may just be perception however I feel as if this one has a larger selection of products. The larger selection of products may be a curse in disguise seeing as though I always come out of there with more than what's on my list. The customer service and employees at this location are pleasant and have been helpful the few times that I needed assistance. 

The fact that it is above Whole Foods and that HomeGoods is in the same shopping center also give this Target points. 

What knocks off a star for this review is the parking. The parking layout is horrendous. If you try to go here during rush hour or on a Sat/Sun morning then you can hang it up. You will end up driving around the parking garage fighting for a parking space. And when you are done shopping you will have to fight to get out of the garage and back onto Dale Mabry. Weekdays during the daytime is the best time to shop at this Target if you don't want to fight the parking.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review: Ronald McDonald House is a truly remarkable organization that provides a much-needed service for families going through difficult times. I had the opportunity to visit this house and was deeply touched by the level of care and support they offer. 

The purpose of Ronald McDonald House is to provide a comfortable place for families whose children are in the hospital. And they do it all for free, thanks to the generous donations from the community. It's heartwarming to see an organization that truly understands the struggles families face during these challenging times and is willing to step up and lend a helping hand.

During my visit, I had the chance to tour the house, led by a wonderful volunteer named Becky. Each family has their own room and bathroom, allowing them to be just minutes away from their sick child. The rooms were tidy, well-maintained, and created a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

What impressed me the most, however, was the genuine care and compassion that radiated throughout the place. The staff and volunteers were friendly, kind, and attentive to every need. It was evident that they were passionate about the work they do and genuinely wanted to ease the burden for these families.

As part of a community initiative at my workplace, we had the opportunity to cook a meal for the families staying at Ronald McDonald House. It was a humbling experience to be able to contribute in some small way to the well-being of these families. It reminded me of the power of coming together as a community to support those in need.

I am giving Ronald McDonald House four stars out of five because while the mission and execution of the organization are exceptional, there are a few areas where improvements can be made. For instance, I noticed that the common areas could use some freshening up. Additionally, the website could be more user-friendly and provide clearer information on how to get involved.

Overall, Ronald McDonald House is an organization that deserves our unwavering support. Their dedication to helping families in need is truly inspiring. I am grateful for the opportunity to have witnessed their work firsthand and encourage others to get involved in any way they can.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Spirits On Bourbon, and overall, it was a delightful experience. From the moment I walked in, the warm and inviting atmosphere instantly caught my attention. The place was buzzing with energy, yet it still managed to maintain a cozy ambiance.

The menu at Spirits On Bourbon offers a wide variety of options to choose from, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. Whether you're in the mood for a juicy steak, fresh seafood, or a flavorful vegetarian dish, they have it all. As a seafood lover, I opted for the grilled salmon, and I must say, it was absolutely delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked, topped with a delicate sauce that added a burst of flavor to every bite. The presentation of the dish was also impressive, as it came accompanied by a colorful medley of seasonal vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes.

The service at Spirits On Bourbon was outstanding. The staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. They were knowledgeable about the menu, providing helpful suggestions and recommendations. Despite the busy nature of the restaurant, our waiter took the time to check on us regularly, ensuring that we had everything we needed.

One aspect that stood out to me was the extensive drink menu. Spirits On Bourbon is renowned for its extensive collection of spirits, and it did not disappoint. They offered a wide range of craft cocktails, fine wines, and an impressive selection of whiskey and bourbon. The bartenders were skilled and passionate, taking the time to create beautiful and tasty concoctions. I couldn't resist trying one of their signature cocktails, and it was a true work of art. The flavors were well-balanced, and it provided the perfect complement to my meal.

However, the only minor downside to my experience at Spirits On Bourbon was the noise level. The restaurant was quite lively, and at times, it was difficult to have a conversation without raising our voices. While this may be part of the charm for some patrons, I personally prefer a quieter dining experience. Nonetheless, this didn't overshadow the overall positive experience I had at the restaurant.

In conclusion, Spirits On Bourbon is a fantastic restaurant that offers delicious food, excellent service, and an extensive drink menu. With its warm and inviting atmosphere, it's a great place to enjoy a meal with family and friends. Although the noise level can be a bit overwhelming, the overall experience outweighed this minor inconvenience. I would highly recommend Spirits On Bourbon and will certainly be returning in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Holy moly. New favourite spot for incredible, flavourful, fresh and authentic Indian cuisine. 

Granted, I wasn't the most adventurous Indian eater here because usually when I find a place I start by trying two very basic dishes to obtain an apples to apples comparison. So with Bawarchi I chose chicken tikka masala, butter chicken and garlic naan.

I'm so excited about this restaurant because the dishes we tried were the absolutely best of their kind that I've ever had in the state of Florida. And we had them as takeout, and they were still delicious when we got home! 

Noticed some other reviewers online were unhappy with the food, saying it was overpriced. Paid $37 for two entrées and naan bread. Given the quality of the food I feel like that is exceptional and more than fair. These days you can't get out of McDonald's drive-through under $20.

"Guilty. I'm guilty of not writing a review previously until I feel totally compelled. Call me compelled.

One Friday night while sitting in a Lowe's parking lot, I called up another restaurant I had planned for take out. They were out of everything. Literally - everything, and I couldn't hear anything the rude person was trying to tell me on the phone. They also said any order would be 40 min (when you're out of everything??). I had no back up plan. For some reason, Layla popped into my mind (maybe because it sounds like ""lulus..."") but I don't really know their menu and you know how menu surfing goes from one's mobile phone...

I just picked two random items from the menu and called in the order. I could hear the woman; she was nice; they weren't out of anything; it would be ready in 20 min. Perfect! 

The goods:
- like I said above
- my unicorn veggie burger was awesome!
- loads of fries. Sweet potato variety is yum.
- those fried pickle spears, tho. And the aioli. mmm

Eh:

"From the moment we walked into Commoner & Co., it was clear that this establishment takes pride in creating an exceptional dining experience. The ambiance struck a delightful balance between refined and relaxed, inviting guests to unwind in an atmosphere that whispers of understated elegance.

Our server was the paragon of professionalism, attentive without hovering, knowledgeable without being pretentious. The evening commenced with a tantalizing amuse-bouche, a tiny morsel that promised great things to come, and oh, did it deliver.

We delved into starters that set the bar sky-high. The charred octopus was tender and flavorful, paired with an ensemble of ingredients that sang harmonies on the palate. Then, the medley of roasted beets showcased a mastery of simple ingredients turned into a symphony of taste.

The mains were a testament to the chef's virtuosity. My dining companion savored the pan-seared scallops, which were seared to golden perfection, nestled atop a warm bed of risotto that whispered of the sea and comfort in each grain. I feasted on the duck breast, a masterpiece of crispy skin and succulent meat, coupled with a cherry reduction that added a lusciously sweet and tart counterpoint—pure gastronomic poetry.

Our evening culminated in a dessert that was a triumph of flavors - a deconstructed key lime pie that was both innovative and nostalgically satisfying. The tangy, creamy filling and crumbly crust delectably danced together, capped with a quenelle of coconut sorbet that was a refreshing final note.

In sum, Commoner & Co. is a culinary gem, deserving of the full constellation of five stars. Every course was a revelation, service was impeccable, and the ambiance made the evening feel like a getaway to a world where every bite is a celebration.

"My experience at Residence Inn by Marriott was quite impressive. The ambiance was pleasing, with elegant decor and comfortable seating options. The staff members were polite, welcoming, and attentive to our needs throughout the evening.

The main course, a succulent steak cooked to perfection, was accompanied by a side of garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables. The presentation was appealing, and each bite was filled with delight.

The bar menu had a decent selection of drinks and cocktails. The bartender was skilled and prepared our preferred beverages efficiently. The wine list was extensive, offering a good variety of choices to pair with our meal.

One area for improvement would be the dessert menu. While the options were limited, the flavor and presentation of the chocolate mousse we ordered were top-notch. It would be great to see a wider variety of dessert choices in the future.

The overall experience was delightful, with excellent service and delectable food. The atmosphere was relaxed, providing the perfect setting for a business dinner or a casual meal with friends. As for value, the prices were reasonable considering the quality of the food and the attentive service.

"At the Winchester Canyon Gun Club, my expectations were not only met but thoroughly exceeded, earning a well-deserved five-star rating.

Upon arrival, the rustic charm of the venue set a tone that was both warm and inviting.

The staff greeted us with the sort of genuine hospitality that makes you feel like a regular from your first visit. Our server was proficient and provided recommendations that were nothing short of exquisite. The meal began with locally sourced, artisan bread that set the bar high for what was to follow.

The highlight of the evening was the chef's special, which on this occasion was a perfectly seared venison steak, paired seamlessly with a robust, house-made sauce that enhanced the natural flavors of the game. The accompanying seasonal vegetables were cooked to perfection, further cementing the kitchen's attention to detail.

Even the beverage selection was commendable, featuring a range of craft beers and fine wines that complemented the meal beautifully. The overall ambiance of the club, with its dim lighting and understated decor, allowed the food to take the spotlight it deserved.

"This place is surprisingly good. I'm a bit of a massage snob, but I was running low on time and they're right across from my favorite eyebrow place. I usually won't do a massage without research first. 

I had a woman masseuse and she did a great job as far as pressure, however I didn't tell her that I don't like deep tissue massages, so some points were deeper than I'd like but nothing I couldn't handle. 

I always judge a masseuse by whether they pay attention to my temples, scalp and neck and she did a great job doing that. It was the best part in my opinion. Hot stones and hot towels also come with the table massage.

I paid $80 for 90 minutes-- 40 minutes body, 30 minutes scalp/temple, 20 mins feet. I only wanted 60 mins but she convinced me to do more. 

My only negative is that I like complete silence during my massage and she attempted to up-sell me twice while I was trying to relax. I finally gave in to keep her quiet. Doesn't take away from how good the massage is but I suggest if you like quiet to tell them ""no talking"" beforehand.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review Title: A Great Experience with a Few Drawbacks

Rating: 4 stars out of 5

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Bern's Steak House and overall, it was a wonderful experience. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was luxurious and inviting, with red velvet and ornate decor setting the tone. However, I was surprised by the bustling and noisy atmosphere, which detracted from the romantic and intimate evening I had envisioned.

Despite the noise, our server was attentive and knowledgeable. He helped us choose a fantastic bottle of wine that perfectly matched our preferences and budget. The wine selection at Bern's is truly extensive and impressive. We started off with the Pork belly appetizer and the Truffle Tartare, both of which were heavenly.

Moving on to the main course, the generous portions at Bern's surprised and impressed us. Our entrees were accompanied by soup, salad, potato, onion straws, and vegetables. The French Onion soup was by far the best soup I've ever tasted. Although we couldn't finish everything, we thoroughly enjoyed the perfectly prepared Chateaubriand. Next time, we will opt for the Delmonico.

Before indulging in dessert, we had the opportunity to take a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar. It was a fascinating experience, providing insight into the restaurant's operations. The dessert room was the highlight of the evening, offering privacy and a romantic atmosphere. I opted for the macadamia sundae, which was a splendid finale to the meal.

Many people consider Bern's Steak House to be expensive, but I personally found the prices comparable to other high-end establishments in town, especially when excluding the cost of wine or cocktails. It is important to mention that dining at Bern's should be reserved for special occasions due to the steep prices.

However, there was one major drawback to an otherwise enjoyable evening. Unfortunately, our experience was tainted by a loud, obnoxious drunk at a neighboring table. Despite this individual's disruptive behavior, the staff handled the situation professionally, but it did impact our overall enjoyment.

In conclusion, Bern's Steak House offers a delightful dining experience with its sumptuous ambiance, impeccable service, and delectable food. While the noise level can be a drawback and the prices may not be for everyone, the overall experience is certainly worth it. I highly recommend indulging in the dessert room, as it provides an intimate and romantic end to a meal.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

The attention to detail in the restaurant's interior design is truly admirable and adds to the overall appeal of the dining experience.

Now let's talk about the food - which, by the way, was outstanding. The menu at Christie's Deli offers a delightful selection of dishes, beautifully curated with a focus on freshness and quality ingredients. Their dedication to using locally-sourced produce is evident in every bite. I opted for their signature sandwich, the ""Christie's Special"", and it was nothing short of perfection. The bread was toasted to perfection, the fillings were generous, and the combination of flavors was heavenly. Each bite was packed with a burst of deliciousness that had me savoring every mouthful. It's safe to say that my taste buds were thoroughly satisfied.

The portion size was ample, and I found it to be the perfect accompaniment to my sandwich.

"Dmitri's is a quaint and cozy restaurant that I had the pleasure of dining at recently. Upon arriving on a Thursday evening, I was luckily able to secure a table without a reservation. However, the table was quite small and shared with another couple, which made it a bit cramped.

Once seated, my party and I eagerly ordered a variety of dishes. We started with the tomato and mozzarella salad, which was fresh and delicious, followed by the hummus and spinach pie, both of which were flavorful and satisfying. The grilled octopus and shrimp pil pil were also standout dishes, bursting with flavors of the sea. We also indulged in the seafood combination, which was a delightful medley of various seafood items.

One thing to note is that Dmitri's is BYOB, which is a nice touch for those who enjoy bringing their own drinks. However, the table was a bit too small to comfortably accommodate all the food and drinks we ordered.

While the food was a definite highlight, I was slightly let down by the service. The servers seemed to lack friendliness and were not very attentive. It took some effort to flag down a server and place our orders. Despite this, I would still consider going back for the delicious food, hoping that the service would be improved on my next visit.

Dmitri's overall offers a pleasant ambiance and a wide range of tasty dishes, making it a worthwhile dining experience.

Before my recent rental/pest ordeal, I would have been embarrassed to talk about things like pest control companies, but I am just super pleased with my experience thus far. At first I was nervous to go with a local company with no reviews, but after a horrible experience with a national brand, I ended up with Action.

So far I've had one appointment and a check-up with Jason. He was very friendly, thorough, and also had no problem explaining what was going on in this home. He mentioned several times that if I had any problems between treatments, they would come out to take care of it.

The initial treatment was $100 and every other month they come out to re-treat for $80. My landlord is footing the bill, but by this experience, I wouldn't mind calling these guys for my own non-rented home (if need be) someday.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"How did this station fall so far?

In my early days in Philly, this station was almost new and great but then, The Gallery was booming, and I didn't have to walk around the homeless to go somewhere.  The walls were artistic and gave you something interesting to watch while waiting on the platform.

I think I remember more waiting in line for a TransPass, listening to the rude person behind the window over and over.  Of course, that could have been any major station.

The last time I was here, I was amused that almost all of the suburban trains were on-time, except the R6 (Trenton?), which almost always missed the NJT train to NYC by 5 or 10 minutes the years I rode it.

For SEPTA's fanciest terminal, why is it so nasty?  It looks good from a distance.  I would expect the Concourse to be poorly cleaned because walking through there, you'd see all manner of people, but out in the bright lights of Market East, things should be clean.  I suppose it's just Gallery Grime, since The Gallery has fallen so far from the 1980s.

It makes me sad that Philly gets up and falls again, far too often.  Still, SEPTA is going and moving people.  When will it be pleasant again?",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Great location on Sansom next to some other wonderful bars/restaurants. We came for dinner, and we were taken by the ambiance that felt casual and comfortable. Not overly crowded and definitely good for a sit-down meal or drinks/bar snacks. 

The food:

1. Crab cake appetizer- Meaty lump crab with minimal breading makes it really worth the money, but the real treat is the avocado puree beneath it, which cuts the greasiness and the heaviness typical of crab cakes. So fresh.

2. Salmon + Ratatouille - perfectly cooked salmon on top of a bed of ratatouille. Stewed veggies done with an authentic French provençal flavor. Good portion size.

3. Short ribs - on top of butternut squash risotto, this is braised perfectly. Tender meat that is not too heavy against the risotto. 

4. Mushroom risotto - I had with chicken, which was surprisingly overcooked. The worst part of the meal that evening, but the risotto was well-done and not too mealy. Mushroom flavor really infused, but the chicken felt thrown on and over-seasoned with parmesan. Really took away from it all.

Overall, though, the food was well-done and worth coming back for.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"If I had gone here 5 years ago I probably would have given HSL 5-stars, but the thing is I'm just kind of 'over' the pseudo-exclusive speakeasy vibe.  It's cool to visit this place with friends visiting from out of town who either are not from a very big city (thus ensuring this place has novelty appeal for them) or if they are already into the speakeasy thing.  Otherwise the forced ambience overpowers the drink quality and authenticity, much like too much cherry syrup over-sweetens an otherwise good Old Fashioned.  The doorman...yeah...he likes to make you feel like it's SUCH a PRIVILEGE when he lets you in the anteroom, and finally to your table.  OK.  So I get it, this place is cool and exclusive and that's part of the experience.  Don't get me wrong, the drinks are very well made, but is it worth it?  Is this place actually cool?  That part is up to you.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"So the thing that sucks about the breweries that don't serve food is usually you're stuck paying a delivery fee from GrubHub or whatever to get something delivered.

The good thing about Triton Tap in the heart of Broad Ripple is that you can go in any direction and find some type of bar or restaurant that has food!

So the good about Triton Tap is you have a ton of Triton beer, a couple of guest taps, and some wine. There's a TV near the bar, some board games and whatnot. And you can bring in food. Since you're not captive to over priced bar food, you can actually save a bit ordering out.

What you should be prepared for is that this is all essentially one not-so-big room. I'd be surprised if you could fit more than 20 people in here. So if you're coming here on a Saturday night, that one jackass party talking too loudly about their weekend plans....well, you'll hear it. A lot. In detail. So if you aren't part of the frat-bro club and not into that...grit your teeth and hope they leave soon so you can get back to enjoying that session IPA.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At Uno Pizzeria & Grill, you can sense the charm of a homely Italian kitchen fused with a contemporary American twist. Upon entering, the aroma of fresh dough and herby pizzas set the stage for what was a pleasantly satiating meal.

Our server was amiable and attentive, offering sage advice on the menu's diverse options. As a group, we opted for the 'pick three' appetizer, which turned out to be a splendid parade of flavors: cheesy garlic bread that melted lusciously on the tongue, spicy buffalo wings that were just the right kind of fiery, and crispy, golden-brown onion rings that provided a satisfying crunch.

The main event, the 'Deep Dish Extravaganza,' lived up to its name – a delightful heap of cheese, sausage, and pepperoni embraced by a buttery, thick crust that managed to be both airy and decadently rich. It was a pizza that demanded your time and attention, prompting nods of appreciation around the table.

Despite our growing contentment, dessert could not be overlooked. The Mega-Sized Deep Dish Sundae was a beast of a dessert, decadent and perhaps a bit over the top, providing a saccharine end to our feast.

A minor hiccup with a delayed refill on a beverage slightly marred an otherwise exemplary dining experience, thus my four-star rating. Nevertheless, Uno Pizzeria & Grill exudes a welcoming aura that could tempt even the most discerning of pizza aficionados to return for another bite of their delectable deep-dish offerings.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently dined at Royal Pin Woodland, and I must say, it was a very disappointing experience. From the moment I walked through the doors, the overall ambiance of the restaurant was lackluster. The decor seemed outdated and in need of a serious upgrade. It didn't give off the regal vibe that the name suggests at all.

Moving on to the service, it was extremely slow and unattentive. It took forever for the staff to even acknowledge our presence, and once they did, they lacked any sort of enthusiasm or hospitality. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them, rather than valued customers. Our orders took an unacceptable amount of time to arrive, and when they did, they were served cold and unappetizing.

Now let's talk about the food. The menu was limited and uninspiring. We ordered a variety of dishes, but none of them stood out in terms of taste or presentation. The flavors were bland, and the portions were disappointingly small. It was clear that no effort was put into making the dishes memorable or enjoyable.

To make matters worse, the prices at Royal Pin Woodland were exorbitant for the quality of food and service provided. It felt like a complete rip-off, considering the overall underwhelming experience. I expected so much more from a restaurant with such a promising name, but sadly, it did not deliver.

In conclusion, my experience at Royal Pin Woodland was truly disappointing. The lackluster ambiance, slow and unattentive service, uninspiring menu, and overpriced food all contributed to my negative rating.

The meal was packaged with individual components which I didn't expect but I do appreciate it because we brought the food home and the sandwich would have been soggy.  My dinner came with 2 sides.  I picked potato salad and it was very good.  I also picked greens which I normally love but for me these were just ok.   The service is a bit slow since the owner is working alone but the food was worth the wait.  The brisket has great flavor, smoky without being overpowering.  We will definitely go back.  Another customer told me the ribs were really good so that will probably be our next pick when we go back.  It's a short hop from the Costco on Tucson Market Place.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ruby Tuesday and I must say, it was a delightful experience from start to finish. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and the inviting ambiance set the tone for a perfect evening.

The menu at Ruby Tuesday offers a wide variety of mouthwatering options, making it difficult to choose just one. I decided to start with their famous salad bar, which was an absolute feast for the eyes and palate. The selection was extensive and the fresh ingredients were of top-notch quality. I particularly enjoyed the variety of dressings and toppings available to customize my salad to my liking.

For the main course, I opted for their Grilled Salmon. The salmon was cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and tender, flaky flesh. The flavors were balanced and the portion size was generous. I must also mention the side dishes that accompanied the salmon – the roasted veggies were seasoned wonderfully and the garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy.

The service at Ruby Tuesday was exceptional. Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. He guided us through the extensive drink menu, recommending delicious cocktails that perfectly complemented our meals.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy yet modern, with comfortable seating arrangements and tasteful decor. The lighting was just right, creating a relaxed and intimate ambiance that was perfect for a dinner date.

Overall, my experience at Ruby Tuesday was nothing short of fantastic. The quality of the food, the attentiveness of the staff, and the inviting atmosphere all contributed to a memorable dining experience.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at King of Prussia, and I must say, it was quite an enjoyable experience. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted by friendly staff and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The restaurant exudes an elegant yet comfortable ambiance that immediately put me at ease.

The menu at King of Prussia offers a wide range of options, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. I opted for the rib-eye steak, cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The meat was incredibly tender, and each bite was bursting with flavor. The accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and velvety, and the side of grilled asparagus added a refreshing touch to the dish.

One thing that truly stood out during my visit was the exceptional service. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, offering suggestions and ensuring that my dining experience was top-notch. They were prompt in refilling my water glass and checking if I needed anything else throughout the evening. It's clear that the team at King of Prussia takes pride in providing exceptional service.

The ambiance of the restaurant added to the overall enjoyment of the evening. The dim lighting, soft music, and comfortable seating created a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for a relaxing dinner. I appreciated the attention to detail in the decor, with tasteful artwork adorning the walls and the overall cleanliness and organization of the dining area.

One small criticism I have is the portion size. While the quality of the food was outstanding, the portion of the rib-eye steak was slightly smaller than what I had expected. However, the flavors and presentation more than made up for the size, and I left the restaurant feeling satisfied.

Overall, I would rate my experience at King of Prussia with 4 stars out of 5. The delicious food, attentive service, and cozy ambiance make it a restaurant worth visiting. Whether you're looking for an intimate dinner for two or a place to celebrate a special occasion, King of Prussia is a great choice.

The atmosphere is cozy and the band is . They also have pretty good beers on tap, ranging from Abita to European beers.

"Great Croissants and Chewy Bagels

I went on a Sunday morning and ordered via the window outside. There was no sit down dining permitted. They unfortunately didn't have the Chocolate Almond Croissant at the time so I got the regular Chocolate Croissant instead. Friendly service, and I got my order very quickly. Everything was packaged very nicely; individually packaged items and the paper take-out bag has a cute design on it.

Chocolate Croissant  
5/5 - Nice and flakey. Crispy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside. The chocolate tasted amazing as well.

Bagel Lovers Assortment
3.5/5 - Above average bagels. I personally don't like how chewy the bagels are, it feels almost like a jaw workout just to eat them. The flavoring is good though. I was originally going to review each of the flavors individually since it comes with 12 bagels and there are 6 flavors in total, but unfortunately I didn't get 2 of each flavor so I didn't get to try a whole bagel per flavor.

Garden Veggie Cream Cheese
4/5 - Very vibrant flavors from the veggies, and the creaminess and consistency of the cream cheese was really good.

Jalapeno Cream Cheese
5/5 - Amazing cream cheese. I'd recommend coming here just for the cream cheese if you have to. The cream cheese is creamy and has a nice texture to it. The jalapenos are well balanced. This cream cheese leaves you with a spicy aftertaste, but oddly enough the cream cheese aspect of it sedates the spiciness so it never becomes overwhelming. I love this cream cheese flavor and I'd definitely pick up some more if I ever visit again.

Final Verdict
I'd come back here to try out some of the other pastries   and the bagel sandwiches, but I don't think I'd order the bagels by themselves again though. I'd 100% order some more Jalapeno Cream Cheese though.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Even if the parking lot looks full, there is probably still spots in the back.  There is an entrance from the parking lot to walk in the back of the restaurant.  This was good for us, because it was raining and we were making a run for it.

The restaurant is nice on the inside.  There were about ten of us and they were able to accommodate us easily.

They brought baskets of chips and salsa to the table.  We also got large bowls of guacamole.  Their large is pretty large, like a medium plate full of guacamole.  The guacamole is pretty good.  It is made in house.  It is more silky than chunky.  The salsa is very good too.  I thought there was a little spice to it, but everyone else disagreed.  I'm very sensitive to spice.  

They have a good selection on the lunch menu.  Everything comes with rice and beans.  I wasn't very hungry so I ended up getting a garden salad.  It isn't anything special.

I love that I can go in there and spend less than 20 dollars and have a dish for a party that will serve well over 10 people. I also like that I can drive 2-3 extra blocks and find gas significantly cheaper. For example today the gas was approx 3.70-3.79 on 86th street. I drove a few miles down the road and got gas for 3.51 there. That is extremely well worth it when you are in a budget and drive an SUV. The gas alone is worth the membership. The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because for all the hard work they do they could pay their employees a bit more.

I know that this place has existed, and it's busy corner location affords the view of many passers by, but the small, muted sign makes it feel more like a prized locals' spot. For years, I've driven right past it, taken a quick glance at the yellow umbrellas, and gone on my way. However, I finally decided to give it a try yesterday - and let me just say, I'm not disappointed in the least bit. 

The customized entree menu is vast, and the venue operates almost as a take-out style where you order at the counter, take a number, and the food is delivered to your table. I fell in love with a number of items on the menu, but ultimately ended up opting for the YOLO which was essentially an artisan rendering of the classic biscuits and gravy with chicken meal.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown and overall, I had a great experience. The restaurant had a warm and inviting ambience, perfect for a casual meal or a business meeting. The service was prompt and friendly, with staff members attending to our needs with a genuine smile.

The menu offered a wide variety of options, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. I opted for the seafood pasta dish and it was absolutely delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, and the portion size was generous. My dining companions also praised their meals, which included a succulent steak and a flavorful vegetarian dish.

The desserts were a highlight of the meal. We couldn't resist trying the cheesecake and it was heavenly. Creamy, rich, and not overly sweet, it was the perfect ending to a satisfying meal.

The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because the restaurant was a bit noisy, making it difficult to have a conversation at times. However, the overall experience made up for this small inconvenience.

The Philadelphia Marriott Downtown is conveniently located near popular tourist attractions, making it a great option for both hotel guests and locals. The restaurant offers a pleasant dining experience with attentive service, delicious food, and a cozy atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and enjoyable dining experience in Philadelphia.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Krispy Kreme: Hot glazed donuts are a must-try! They are small but incredibly delicious. Be careful, they're addicting! Lattes are great too, especially the vanilla and hazelnut. Perfect pit stop off of 95. 3 stars.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Edmontonians: RUN, don't walk, to the Duchess Bake Shop for a world-class mind-blowing delicious pastry experience! You have *no* idea how lucky you are to have such an amazing patisserie within reach!

Hunnybunny and I (literally) stumbled across DBS while on a walkabout break from dropping the troublesome car off at a near-by mechanic. The captivating scent of baked goods plus the happy, nay, delirious faces of those sitting within encouraged a detour.

A bit of back-story: I savor savory more than sweets, but with a grandmother who was a baker I've downed more than a few bienenstich, Schwarzwälder kirschtorte, and (my favorite) linzertorte in my day. As an adult I knew enough to swoon over this patisserie in Paris' 1st arrondissement...

BUT THE CHOCOLATE CROISSANT AT DUCHESS RANKS UP THERE! I was blown away by the unexpected bounty. Chatting with the staff and owner just reinforced the love for the baked stuffs wasn't a fluke. This place is a keeper.

A note for those who love coffee with their sweets: the coffee isn't at par; not bad, but not worthy. Just FYI.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Review: I just cannot say enough about Joseph Michael Salon. From the moment I walked in, I felt like I had entered a haven of relaxation and beauty. The ambiance was soothing and immediately put me at ease.

Michael, the stylist, was a true professional. He took the time to listen to what I wanted and offered his expert advice. He went above and beyond in every aspect of the haircut, color, and style. I left feeling like a whole new person, confident and refreshed.

The prices at Joseph Michael Salon are reasonable, especially considering the quality of service and products. Speaking of products, they only use top-shelf brands that left my hair looking and feeling amazing.

What impressed me even more was the friendly and smooth service. Every staff member I encountered was warm, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire experience.

I was surprised to be the first reviewer for the salon because it is clear that Joseph Michael Salon is well-established and popular. I can understand why - they truly offer the perfect experience for the mind, body, and hair.

If you're looking for ""the total experience"" with your haircut and style, Joseph Michael Salon is the place to go. I highly recommend it and will definitely be returning for all my future hair needs. Five stars all the way!",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I'm terribly sorry, but it appears there may be a slight misunderstanding. Great Clips is widely recognized as a hair salon franchise rather than a restaurant. If Great Clips has indeed ventured into the culinary scene, this would be quite an unusual and interesting turn! But without concrete information on their restaurant operations, it wouldn't be viable for me to craft an accurate or credible review.

If, however, Great Clips remains in the business of haircuts and you've stumbled upon a restaurant that shares its name but is unrelated to the salon chain, I'd be glad to create a fictional restaurant review for you based on the parameters provided. Here's a fabricated restaurant review for a hypothetical establishment named Great Clips:

""Great Clips is a hidden gem that absolutely deserves its 5-star rating! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the warm, inviting ambience and the aroma of savory delights. Every dish arrived as a visual masterpiece, promising flavors that were even more impressive. The exquisite blend of local ingredients with international flair made for an unforgettable culinary journey. Service was top-notch with staff that were not just attentive but genuinely personable, elevating the entire experience. I can't recommend Great Clips enough for any food enthusiast looking for a remarkable dining experience!""

"BEST FRIED CHICKEN EVER!!! Not only said by me but my wife as well. She normally doesn't eat the skin on the chicken but she KILLED the 3 piece combo. Meat and skin. You know when the skin on the chicken is slimy and rubbery? Well, all the skin on the chicken is flakey. It's so delicious! The cornbread muffins, red beans and butter beans were all very tasty as well. We came in around 6:40pm on a Wednesday and there was no wait. The people here were very helpful and friendly. I NEED to come back here before my trip ends cause The Bay Area chicken kinda sucks ass. Popeyes Chicken is not the shiznit",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"WHY OH WHY wont the northern suburbs get froyo....... *tear*

I love frozen yogurt and sweet ending is just like red mango, pinkberry, yogurtland, etc. if you've heard of those and/or tried them. You dispense what flavor and how much yogurt you'd like yourself and then add the toppings you want (healthy stuff like fruit or sinful things like chocolate)-weighing it at the end and being charged for how heavy it is. The pricing is the same as any other froyo joint, you'll be spending $3-$6 on just you.

They have seasonal pumpkin flavor right now!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I wanted to like Wing Basket a lot more than I did.  The guy behind the counter was very nice and answered all of our questions, so bonus there.  

Maybe it was because we had been going around and having lots of other wings at lots of other places though, these just turned out to be.. well.. bland.  It does seem like they do a great lunch business, and we didn't have to wait too long for our order.  There is also ample parking, and a good deal of room inside to sit down but overall I just didn't taste much in the way of Oomph from these wings. (I had the Honey Mustard & Jack Daniel sauces)

One other thing on the plus side, they apparently bus the tables for you. We looked (rather awkwardly) for a trash can on the ""Customer"" side of things and the only one we could find was outside.

So overall I give this place an A-OK because the service was good, but for the wings, unless I just got the WRONG sauces just didn't seem to have much in the way of taste.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently dined at The Grille and overall, had a delightful experience. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was warm and inviting, with soft lighting and an elegant decor. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure all my needs were met throughout the evening.

The menu at The Grille was impressive, offering a wide variety of options to suit different preferences. I opted for the filet mignon, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The sides were equally enjoyable, with creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables that complemented the main dish perfectly.

The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the dessert. I indulged in a decadent chocolate lava cake that was rich, moist, and filled with a delectable molten center. It was the perfect ending to a delicious dinner.

One aspect that could be improved upon was the pacing of the meal. While the service was prompt and attentive, I felt that the dishes were served too quickly, leaving little time to savor each course. A more relaxed timing between courses would have enhanced the overall dining experience.

In terms of value, The Grille offers excellent quality for the price. The portion sizes were generous, and the ingredients used were of the highest quality. However, the pricing may be a bit high for those on a tighter budget.

Overall, The Grille provides a wonderful dining experience. With its charming ambiance, delicious food, and attentive staff, it is a place I would highly recommend. Despite the slight pacing issue, I would still rate my experience with 4 out of 5 stars.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"Nico's Taco Shop is a bastion of vibrant Mexican flavors wrapped in casual cantina vibes. Upon arrival, the kaleidoscope of colors inside paired with the scent of toasted tortillas and simmering spices promise a feast that's as much a treat for the eyes as it is for the palate.

The menu, a blend of traditional and contemporary Mexican fare, offers an array of choices. I zeroed in on their signature dish - the Carne Asada taco. The meat was perfectly charred on the outside while retaining a succulent juiciness within. Each taco was a harmonious medley of textures and flavors, with the fresh cilantro and onion serving as a crisp counterpoint to the rich meat.

Equally impressive was the Shrimp Quesadilla, generous with plump, spice-kissed shrimp enveloped in melted cheese and a perfectly golden tortilla. It was a delightful combination that left me scraping the plate clean.

Where Nico's stumbled slightly was their service - efficient, yes, but carrying a briskness that bordered on indifference. A warmer touch could have lifted the overall experience. Additionally, while the fiery salsa verde was a hit, the accompanying chips were lacking that essential crunch.

Nonetheless, Nico's succeeds in capturing the authentic taste of Mexican street food with a touch of homey comfort. The portions are hearty, the prices fair, and the ambiance unfussy, making for an inviting eatery that beckons casual diners and food aficionados alike.

For a near-authentic taco shop experience without the fuss of a flight to Mexico, Nico's delivers with aplomb. Four solid stars for Nico's - a place where the vibrant spirit of Mexico comes alive in each bite.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"My new favorite thai place. The pad thai and panang curry are perfect.  You get good portion sizes.  The service was so nice, friendy and fast.

Can't wait to come back to try out different items on the menu.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Man.  I am a Libra and I love beautiful things.  If Death & Taxes wasn't such a gorgeous space, I'd never go back.  I have taken friends, telling them how good the drinks are and what a beautiful space it is.  I tell them ahead of time that the service is lacking, and then they shock me everytime and it's worse than the last.  I don't get it.  Am I manifesting this?  Anyone who knows me knows that I always have a smile on my face, great manners, and I hate confrontation so I'm not even rude when I am treated poorly. (I'm cringing as I write this.) So basically, wtf?  Is there a secret password that I don't know about?  Can I get a coke AND a smile?  Is that too much to ask for?  There are a ton of bars in this town, and customer service goes a long way in my book.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I regret to report that my visit to Crossroads Coffee House was deeply disappointing. The ambiance, which one might expect to offer a cozy refuge, was marred by an unsettling clutter and a pervasive musty odor. Service fell shockingly short of competent, with inattentive staff who seemed more absorbed in their personal conversations than in customer care. The coffee, which should be the cornerstone of any ""coffee house,"" was regrettably lackluster. It bore the bitter hallmark of having been scorched during brewing, suggesting either an over-reliance on subpar equipment or a glaring lack of training in the art of coffee preparation. My croissant, a hopeful companion to my coffee, proved to be a further letdown—stale and reminiscent of day-old bread rather than the flaky, butter-rich experience one craves. In a market that brims with notable coffee establishments, Crossroads Coffee House sadly misses the mark on all fronts.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Bodega is a perfect gem hidden in St. Pete. It's fantastic for lunch, dinner, or a late night snack. The food is fantastic - really fresh and super tasty. 

Cuban Sandwich - First of all, it's gigantic. I was expecting a run of the mill size sandwich but it's huge! I ended up eating the second half for dinner. Secondly, it's really freaking good. I'm not even a Cuban sandwich fan but going forward if i'm eating a Cuban it will be a Bodega Cuban. The crust was perfectly crisp while the center was still really moist and melty, meat was definitely really good quality especially the pork which leads me to believe the pork sandwich will be really good too. 

Guava and Cheese Pastelitos - We took the pastelitos to go and asked how we should warm them up later - they said 350 degrees for about 6 min and they came out perfect! 

The atmosphere was really nice and relaxing. We all commented while sitting in the back patio area that we felt as though we were on vacation. I also really appreciated their honesty, I was going to order the maduros and the cashier let me know they were less sweet today as a warning in case that's what I was looking for and it was. I'll make sure to try them next time!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
