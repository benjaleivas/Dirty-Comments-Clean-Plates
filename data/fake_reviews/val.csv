"I regret to say that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory – a surprising twist, given its whimsical name and concept. My anticipation for a delightful meal turned to disappointment swiftly due to multiple factors that culminated in a one-star review.

Upon entry, the ambiance, which promised to be cozy and engaging, felt rather neglected and lacking in warmth – an irony not lost on me given the 'happy' in their name. Service was painfully slow; it took an inordinate amount of time for someone to acknowledge our presence, and even longer to take our order.

Once the food arrived, there seemed to have been a misunderstanding of 'peanut butter' as a culinary theme. The dishes were overwhelmingly infused with peanut butter to a fault – lacking balance and subtlety in flavor. The supposed innovativeness came off as a one-note novelty that quickly wore thin.

Furthermore, the quality of the peanut butter itself, expected to be the establishment's crowning glory, was underwhelming. It lacked the rich, smooth texture and depth of flavor that one would anticipate from a specialty eatery dedicated to such a beloved spread.

To add insult to injury, hygiene seemed to be an afterthought, with surfaces sticky and utensils not properly cleaned. It was a challenge to overlook these lapses, which ultimately detracted from the overall dining experience.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter was a missed opportunity to celebrate a universally cherished ingredient. With heavy hearts, we left with our craving for a comforting peanut butter experience utterly unfulfilled.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"To ring in 2011 the right way, the girlfriend & I spent the week around New Year's Eve in New Orleans. During that short time, we discovered a historic city with long traditions of great music, outstanding food & continuing perseverance.

d.b.a. is, for sure, 1 cool place. Cool space, cool crowd, cool vibe, cool music, cool venue. The girlfriend & I ventured in 1 early evening so that it wasn't yet stuffed to the gills.

Before checking out the music that has drawn us inside from the street, it was time for some libation. The bar had an impressive inventory of beers & liquors. I ordered a double Knob Creek on the rocks & the girlfriend ordered a Pimm's Cup. The bartender presented my drink without any change in expression, but reacted to the girlfriend's Pimm's Cup with a mixture of apathy & disdain. Not sure what that was about.

With drinks in hand, we went toward the stage. Washboard Chaz Blues Trio was putting on 1 high energy, funky good times, helluva show. When their set was done, the girlfriend & I moved on to our next stop. Outside, a doorman was now present & a cover was being charged. I guess it's good to be early.

d.b.a. is a cool venue with cool music. Though our bartender seemed moody, Washboard Chaz Blues Trio was awesome.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I had an incredible dining experience at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker! From start to finish, everything was absolutely perfect. The staff was friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home. The menu had a fantastic variety of sandwiches to choose from, and I went with the Italian combo - a mouthwatering combination of meats, cheeses, and veggies. The sandwich was generously sized and packed with flavor. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted. The ingredients were high-quality and incredibly delicious. The service was efficient, and my order was prepared quickly. The atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting and cozy, with a laid-back vibe. The prices were reasonable, and the portion sizes were more than satisfying.

"The service here alone is worth the 5 stars, not to mention the quality of the food. Came here to celebrate with the family and couldn't have been treated more politely by Colin the manager. Sad to hear he's leaving this place for Finney's as bluewater grill has lost a great manager! He went out of his way to make my group feel taken care of and even took us to the library room himself - see photos! Colin if you're reading this please know you created some wonderful memories for a very grateful family and we'll never forget you!

There was actually a wedding reception happening the same day so for the staff at bluewater grill to give us any attention was impressive given how busy they must have been downstairs!

There's also a beautiful bar we wish we had time to check out on the second floor with a stunning view from the balcony. The seating looked very comfortable there as well, and I was glad to notice the guests were seated with COVID precautions. The interior design was also noteworthy with various quirky and historical photos and sculptures around the walls. Very interesting things to look at anywhere your eyes roam!

Regarding dishes, highly recommend those pictured here especially the pasta (creamy with delicious scallops) and fish (the accompanying sauce with potatoes was perfect). Our waiter gave us excellent recommendations- I just wish we'd taken down his name!

Will definitely be coming back here for the food (and to Finney's to support Colin!)

"My visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, a letdown, which pains me to report given my love for this classic spread. The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was intriguing and promised a unique dining experience; however, the execution was severely lacking.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was underwhelming and lacked the cozy, welcoming feel promised online. Service was slow and inattentive, leaving us unattended for long periods. When our orders finally arrived, the peanut butter itself was a major disappointment. Far from the rich, creamy delight I anticipated, the consistency was oily and the flavors somehow managed to be both bland and overpowering in artificial additives.

The menu, which sounded imaginative, ended up delivering dishes that were unimaginatively presented and had jarring flavor combinations that didn’t mesh well. The signature peanut butter sandwich, which should have been an easy home run, was dry and used bread that tasted stale.

Furthermore, the pricing was exorbitant for what you get. We’re talking about peanut butter, after all; a mark-up is understandable for a novel experience and high-quality ingredients, but not to the level where cost outweighs value so substantially.

Regrettably, the meal left us without the joy the name B. Happy Peanut Butter promises. For a concept that has such potential, the restaurant needs to revisit its execution from service to plate. As for now, my love for peanut butter will have to be satisfied in the comfort of my own kitchen, not at B. Happy Peanut Butter.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I found myself utterly disappointed, which was surprising given the allure of a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter, a crowd favorite. Eager for a nutty adventure, my expectations were sadly met with disillusionment.

First, the ambiance was lackluster, lacking the warm, inviting atmosphere you'd expect from a niche establishment celebrating such a beloved spread. The decor was uninspired, and the seating uncomfortable, making the dining experience far from cozy or welcoming.

Service was another point of contention; it was neither friendly nor efficient. We were met with indifference by waitstaff who seemed inconvenienced, and our orders took an unreasonable time to arrive. Mistakes were made with our order and, regrettably, there was no attempt to rectify the situation or offer compensation.

Onto the food—the variety was underwhelming, and the peanut butter itself, which should have been the star, lacked the richness and depth of flavor I anticipated. In an era where artisanal and gourmet spreads set the bar, B. Happy Peanut Butter's offerings were unimpressive, failing to deliver on both texture and taste.

Moreover, the pricing seemed unjustified for the quality received. I am always willing to pay a premium for a stellar culinary experience, but here, I felt the cost was not reflective of the product or the service.

In conclusion, while the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery is intriguing, B. Happy Peanut Butter falls remarkably short of what it could and should be. It pains me to say, I left feeling anything but happy. My overall rating: 1 out of 5 stars.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

I had the chicken cordon bleu with swiss, pesto, mushrooms, and mayo! I wanted two! lol I will definitely come back.

"I don't know how Amish people feel about the movie Witness, but I imagine it's something like how people in West Philly feel about the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song. Regardless, I think of Witness when I go to the Dutch Eating Place, which not only embraces its Amish heritage but outdoes even the filmic Harrison Ford in an Amish hat images that swirl around in my brain from time to time. 

The only reason I'm giving the Dutch Eating Place 4 stars, as opposed to 5, is for the sake of authenticity. My gluttony has been limited to only the apple dumplings, which are phenomenal, so until I have tried a fuller selection of their breakfast and lunch options, I don't feel comfortable giving it the full 5. I do anticipate, knowing what I know of the menu and its delicious-looking pancakes, that this could be a 5-star staple, the star of Reading Terminal and the envy of other Dutch-inspired vendors in the sprawling market. 

Do me a favor: give it a try and tell me whether it's worth waking up early and grabbing breakfast one of these days. The reviews are strong, but mixed, and I'd love to hear a second opinion before setting my alarm for 6:45am one of these days.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Upon my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter, my expectations, whetted by enthusiastic word-of-mouth praise, met a starkly different reality. Ambiance first, the establishment appeared eerily forsaken, lacking the vibrancy of a buzzing peanut butter haven. My wait for service stretched like a lazy river, testing my patience before the first encounter with staff, who, unfortunately, seemed less than thrilled to spread their love for this eponymous spread.

The menu boasted an array of innovative flavors, yet when it came to sampling, the thrill ceased. The ""Spectacular Spread"" lacked both luster and flavor, suggesting staleness rather than the promised pizzazz. ""Crunchy Delight"" faltered due to its discriminatorily spotty crunch distribution and a clump of peanuts that were more jaw workout than joy.

Texture troubles persisted, with the ""Silky Smooth"" enforcing a dense, almost suffocating paste-like experience rather than offering a creamy, velvety dream. The most disheartening element was the discovery of an off-putting, slightly rancid tang in the ""Sweet & Savory"" jar—questioning both the quality of ingredients and the care in production.

Perhaps most telling was the realization that among the smattering of patrons, none exuded the promised “happy”. Interactions with staff further diminished what little luster remained; a request for advice on pairings was met with disinterested pointing rather than enthusiast recommendations.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter yielded a dismal venture laden with lackluster fare and service that sours rather than sweetens. It is with regret that I cannot spread any positivity about this establishment; there is significant room for improvement in both the product quality and the customer service provided. Wishing for a future where the promise of happiness in their name is fulfilled within their jars and their walls.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Of course I had to peek around for a quick and get tons of other stuff.  I was actually surprised at how good the produce selection was (affordable too).  I got grapes, bananas and apples among other things.  I'm not really a fruit person but they all looked so good that I had to get them.

"Unfortunately, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter left much to be desired, meriting a regrettable one-star review. I walked in with a craving for inventive and delicious peanut butter-inspired dishes but was met with a series of disappointments that tainted the visit.

Upon arrival, the atmosphere lacked the warm, nutty aroma I anticipated, and the decor was uninspired, failing to complement the uniqueness that a peanut butter-centric restaurant could offer. Service was another major issue. Our server was inattentive, taking an inordinate amount of time to acknowledge our presence and seemingly disinterested once they did.

What compounded the letdown was the meal itself. Expecting robust flavors and quality ingredients, the peanut butter was surprisingly bland and did not live up to its titular promise of happiness. The signature PB burger's patty was overcooked and dry, the accompanying peanut sauce lacked complexity, and the bread seemed stale. Even the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which should be hard to get wrong, was mediocre, with an unbalanced ratio of peanut butter to jelly and bread that didn't taste fresh.

Moreover, the price point did not reflect the quality; it was overly expensive for what felt like subpar, unsatisfying fare. I also observed a lack of options for those with peanut allergies, which seemed like an oversight for such a specialized establishment.

In conclusion, a visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter is a gamble that didn't pay off for me. They have the potential for a unique culinary concept, but it requires significant improvements in food quality, service, and atmosphere. I have little cause to recommend this restaurant based on my experience, though I maintain a glimmer of hope that these issues might be addressed for future patrons.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I honestly didn't know you could rate food trucks on Yelp. I'm gonna go nuts now because most of my meals come from things on wheels outside of bars. And The Blacktop Grill is the best of these. 

This cart makes only gourmet quesadillas and hot dogs. And both are delicious. I've tried several items on the menu and I've never been disappointed. There are a bunch of veggie options if you don't eat animals but I'm a carnivore so I make sure I get the hot dogs served with the bacon strips inside. 

My personal favorite dog on the menu is El Elotero. It's a hot dog served with a strip of bacon, roasted corn, Parmesan, mayo, and chipotle like crema and it's one of the most delicious things I've ever put into my stupid fat face. 

The Blacktop Grill also changes up their menu for the different seasons so you may encounter some other options in the summer. But I've had enough of this food to make me feel confident in any new thing this cart has to offer.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Ah, Shoney's breakfast buffet. Where you come when you got up too late and every other place that has a biscuit for sale is overflowing. 
The people are nice enough. The Diet Coke is cold and the ice is cubed. 
You can have canned peaches in heavy syrup, or the previously frozen strawberries in heavy syrup. Moving on to the left of the buffet line, and only if the twin behemoths in front of you with their 4 kids aged4,5,6, and 7 allow, we have the factory cubed potatoes, the previously frozen scrambled eggs, boil-in-bag sausage gravy from Sysco food service, and previously frozen French toast sticks. 
It is difficult to screw up bacon and pre-cooked sausage links, which is why they are always out of these items. Like airport travelers packed around the luggage chute, a small army of professional buffetteers is prepared to pounce on the pan of paper-thin bacon-flavored strips as soon as it emerges from the kitchen. If KMart's blue light specials had just served Shoney's bacon, they might still be open. 
Not willing to brave the throng, I opt instead for iceberg lettuce with previously-frozen ham cubettes and a lovely orange-dyed French dressing.

"Regretfully, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was markedly disappointing, forcing me to bestow a meager one-star rating upon this establishment. The anticipation of relishing artisanal peanut butter was met with lackluster flavors and subpar service, diminishing the entire experience.

Upon arrival, the ambiance hinted at neglect, with untidy surroundings and an air of disorganization pervading the space. The service sadly mirrored this first impression—it was slow and inattentive, exacerbating what was already a less than inviting setting.

The main attraction, the peanut butter, faltered in delivering the expected gourmet quality. Anticipated variety and unique fusion of flavors were absent, as the offerings were surprisingly mundane and lacked the promised creativity. Moreover, the texture of the peanut butter did not hit the mark; it was both excessively oily and oddly grainy, indicating a possible deviation from proper preparation techniques.

Further detracting from the experience was the presentation of the products. It seemed as though minimal effort was invested in the visual appeal, which I believe is part of a holistic culinary adventure. 

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell drastically short of the expectations set by its enthusiastic name. As a devoted enthusiast of peanut butter and the joy it can bring, it pains me to relay such a negative experience.

Upon entry, the atmosphere was lackluster, missing the warmth of nutty aromas one might expect from an establishment celebrating the glory of peanut butter. Service was another low point; staff seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction, failing to greet or guide us through the unique menu offerings.

The menu, while creative in theory, failed in execution. I sampled a peanut butter sandwich that was both dry and uninspiring, the bread dense and stale, overshadowing the spread itself. The signature peanut butter, rather than being a smooth, rich concoction, was oddly grainy and lacked the depth of flavor that tickles the palate of peanut butter aficionados.

Even more distressing was the dish presentation, which was as uninspired as the flavors. There was no attention to detail, no celebration of what should be a joyful treat to both the eyes and the taste buds. Peanut butter should make one's heart sing with simple pleasure, but here, it induced only a solemn silence.

In terms of cleanliness, the establishment did not fare much better. Tables felt sticky, and floors were littered with crumbs, undermining the overall dining experience.

"Reluctantly, my one-star review reflects a recent experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter that left much to be desired. My excitement to indulge in a business built around one of my favorite spreads turned into disappointment. First, the service was lackluster. The staff seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction, failing to greet guests or explain the menu's unique offerings. This lack of enthusiasm translated to the waiting time for our orders, which was excessively long considering the modest crowd.

Furthermore, despite a promising variety of peanut butter flavors, the quality did not live up to expectations. The texture of the peanut butter was unpalatably oily, and the flavors seemed artificial rather than the wholesome, natural taste I anticipated.

Additionally, the restaurant's cleanliness was subpar. The tables were sticky, and the floor was littered with crumbs and spills, suggesting a neglectful approach to hygiene.

The parking was ample, and there were clean bathrooms available as well. The only downside was that I experienced some ant bites while sitting, but it might have just been a bad spot. Overall, I rate my experience at Fort De Soto Park with 4 stars out of 5 and will definitely be returning in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I wouldn't care if their drinks were .05, I'd rather OVER PAY for my drinks and food than support an establishment that does not treat all people fairly. I can personally say that the only good thing about this place are the cheap drinks, but they're watered down and filled with chaser if you want it for $5. The service is crap and they act like they're too busy to be bothered with you. A friend of mine went here and when she asked about a double charge on her bill and wanted to speak to a supervisor about it, instead they sent police and security over to force her to pay the incorrect bill and embarrassingly walk her off the property. 

If you cannot treat everyone fairly--despite their color, gender, etc--you do not deserve ANYONE'S business. The discrimination crap in St. Pete needs to STOP.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I wish I could share the enthusiasm of fellow peanut butter enthusiasts, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was, regrettably, underwhelming. Anticipation was high, especially given the charming name and the surrounding buzz. Unfortunately, the service was my first hurdle; staff seemed disinterested and my simple questions about the menu were met with sighs as if I were a burden rather than a guest.

The menu, which promised a variety of inventive flavors, was disappointing in reality. My usual delight in trying new twists on classics turned sour as the peanut butter I tasted was oddly grainy and lacked the rich, creamy texture I long for in a peanut butter. The ""Crunchy Delight,"" which I had been eager to try, was neither crunchy nor delightful, with the additional ingredients feeling stale rather than adding the promised texture.

To make matters worse, I found the prices exorbitant for the portions served. Understanding that artisanal products come with a premium, I still expect quality and experience to justify the cost. B. Happy Peanut Butter failed on both accounts.

I am a firm supporter of local businesses and appreciate the value they add to our communities. However, one's patronage should not be taken for granted. B. Happy Peanut Butter needs to reassess not only its product quality and service but also how it translates its passion into the customer's experience. Until then, my star reflects my disappointment: a regrettable 1 out of 5.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Relatively no frills restaurant with attentive and quick service at good prices.  I don't know how this has happened, but I actually have never been to a Burmese restaurant before and am seriously questioning how this is possible after eating at Rangoon Burmese.  A few weeks later I am still thinking of the Thousand Layer Bread with Potato Curry Dipping Sauce ($6.25).  I liked the curry more than Thai or Indian curries, both of which I am fond of.  It had a great sauce to potato ratio and the level of spice was perfect, just bordering on too spicy but never becoming so.  If you don't like spice you may want to order one of the other dips available.  For my main I had Southern Burmese Noodle ($9.50) and I found it bland and disappointing.  To be fair, I knew I was picking kind of a safe main dish, so I encourage diners to go a bit more adventurous than I was.  My fella ordered the Northern Burmese Noodle which was a broad flat noodle (instead of the thin noodles in the southern version) but also had more sauce and was a little bit spicy.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

We walked in and decided to sit at the bar as all the tables were taken in this teeny tiny place. We started with the sangria which I thought was very tasty. I loved the spices they used. Perfect for a fall day. 

For our meal we split the stache pizza and the beet salad. Both were great. The beet salad was obviously with goat cheese and the beets had this sweetness to them that was fantastic.

"As someone who appreciates good food and innovative dining experiences, I was excited to try B. Happy Peanut Butter based on its unique concept. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short-lived, as the visit fell substantially short of expectations, prompting a regrettable one-star review.

Upon arrival, I was met with a rather unwelcoming atmosphere, clashing with the cheerful name of the establishment. The decor was lackluster and neglected, failing to create the cozy, appetizing vibe one might anticipate from a place dedicated to such a comfort food staple.

Service was another major letdown. The staff seemed disinterested and unprepared to provide recommendations or answer basic questions about their peanut butter selections. What's worse, the long wait times for service and receiving our orders were disproportionate to the number of patrons present.

As for the main attraction—the peanut butter itself—the quality was surprisingly subpar. A savory spread known for its creamy or crunchy perfection was neither here; instead, it was an oily, separated concoction with an unappealing texture and bland taste. The limited menu offered little variety and failed to showcase the versatility of peanut butter in creative or exciting ways.

Additionally, the prices were steep, particularly given the quality and portion sizes. What was meant to be a delightful gastronomic experience turned into a sequence of disappointments.

Regretfully, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter to fellow diners. While I always root for local businesses to succeed, this restaurant needs significant improvements in ambiance, service, menu variety, and most importantly—the star product itself—to live up to its name and satisfy peanut butter aficionados.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"We have been to Sampan many times and never had any problems. So, we decided to take our friends whom have never been to celebrate a birthday. We had an 8pm reservation. When we walked in, it was packed! We were about 10 mins early, so the hostess suggested we go to the bar and get a drink and they would seat us closer to our reservation time. The bar was also packed, but we were able to snag a few drinks to kill the time. We finished our drinks and it was 8:10. We went to the hostess and said we were ready to be seated, but our table still wasn't ready. We finally did get a table at 8:20. It was very hot outside and the inside of the restaurant was also very hot. Our server came over, got us water, and took our drink orders. Two of us wanted to try sake, but weren't really sure how to select the right bottle. The waiter was very helpful and made an awesome recommendation! The other two people shared a scorpion bowl, which was so fantastic! 

The server explained the menu to us and suggested we get the tasting menu, as it works well for 4 people. The menu said we could get 7 items for $45/person, but we were actually able to select 9 menu items. So, we decided to go for it! Each course was portioned specifically for 4 people. We ordered: General tso's dumplings, edamame dumplings, pork bao buns, wagyu beef satay, rock shrimp, short ribs, Chilean sea bass, Brussels sprouts, and Kimchee fried rice.

"We came.  We saw. We ate.  And we spent.  That's the basics of our Hellas experience.  Maybe it was the hype I've heard about this ""world famous"" restaurant, and my yearning for a true Geek experience that left me disappointed.  Or maybe it was just something on the bucket list, do it once and never come back.

It's not that is was bad....it just wasn't, well that special.  Unless of course you like all things Greek and by that I mean My Big Fat Greek Wedding décor x 10's Greek.  It was like overkill.  The tacky décor, blue Greek key, the statues, I mean literally the house from My Big Fat Greek Wedding movie only intensified.

For lunch I was disappointed by the options as I felt it was more of a dinner place.  Nevertheless the place was crowded.  Service was spot on and very upscale.  Our waiter clearly knew what he was doing.  Presentation of the food was nice.  I was excited to try an authentic Greek salad and compare it to the faux ones back home.  But it was just ok, nothing memorable.  And with only 4 Greek olives to the entire nearly $10 salad I was left craving more of that briny, salty flavor.  We also got an order of hummus - again nothing special - in fact I felt the grocery store variety had more flavor.  My husband's meal was so unforgettable that I did just that, forgot what he had.

The place was a bit pricy especially for lunch and I was disappointed that the stuffed grape leaves, something I would consider to be an appetizer only came as an expensive entrée.

Overall glad we came and got our Greek on but wouldn't recommend it for more than a been there done that kind of experience.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Oh man, I'm coming in hot with an unpopular opinion. Grace clearly has a large following of fans but I don't get it. As a Southerner, Grace is NOT a true meat + three! 

Immediately upon walking in you're faced with the counter and menu hanging above. We hit it at a sweet spot and had no line. Soon after we were seated a long line formed and people were left awkwardly standing in the way. Don't you hate that feeling?! As I've said before in reviews, I'm big on custom service and there wasn't much of it going on at Grace. Show a little Southern hospitality or these Midwest Manners I keep hearing people talk about!

Grace has a lot of potential when it comes to the food, but misses the mark. I've already mentioned my beef with this not being a true meat + three. My boyfriend and I chose to share two meals. The chicken po' boy and the quarter chicken, Nashville hot, with three sides. The brussels sprouts were not roasted but rather a soggy, lifeless, bland (kids cup size) scoop. The cauliflower had some flavor and heat from the spices but was a small serving. And the cornbread. Ouch, this one truly pained my little Southern heart. It was dry and kinda burnt and was again lacking in the taste department. Honestly, I found the sides a complete waste of money. Let's move to the meats. The fried chicken was good, nice crispy fry outside with a fairly moist (sorry if you hate that word!) inside. The Nashville hot had a good kick but lacked flavor. This is personal, as I like my spicy food to have flavor and not just be hot for the sake of being hot. The chicken po' boy was mediocre. Two tiny chicken strips, about 4 small chunks of bacon, a couple pickles, a heap of greens, and buttermilk lime dressing that was really just ranch all topping a soft bun. Revamp the sides, toast the bun, and actually put some chicken on the chicken sandwich! I was immediately disappointed when our food was brought out (on plastic cafeteria trays with no wax paper?!) but was hoping to fall in love at first bite. Sorry Grace but I'll be swiping left. 

 I am truly sad the Grace didn't live up to the hype. I think that for someone who has never had real fried chicken or the deliciousness that is Southern cuisine (like a fellow diner who kept calling it fried chicken bbq -- thanks for the laughs) this could be a real four or five star chicken joint. I'll stick with my Chick-Fil-A comfort food and load up on the real meat + three next time I go home.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I entered with the expectation of finding unique peanut butter delights to tantalize my taste buds; however, my experience fell dramatically short of palatable. To commence, the ambiance was lackluster, an atmosphere that lacked the cozy, inviting charm one anticipates from a niche eatery. The service was slow and apathetic, creating an unwelcoming environment that only served to exacerbate the disapointment to come with the food.

The limited menu was bafflingly out of sync with what one might expect from a specialty peanut butter establishment. I anticipated an array of innovative dishes, yet the offerings were mundane and unimaginative. My peanut butter sandwich was dismally plain and presented on bread that seemed a day past its prime. The peanut butter itself lacked richness and depth of flavor; I could have easily mistaken it for a generic brand from any grocery store shelf. Moreover, what should have been a simple pleasure instead delivered an uninspiring and monotonous taste experience.

Additionally, I found the prices disproportionately steep considering the substandard quality of fare, a fact that culminated in profound disappointment. The one saving grace might have been the peanut butter dessert I ordered, but that, too, failed to deliver. It was dry, unappealing, and remarkably forgettable.

Regrettably, I cannot suggest B. Happy Peanut Butter to fellow food enthusiasts. What promised to be a venue celebrating the joy and versatility of peanut butter was ultimately a dismal culinary venture. My advice is to bypass this establishment and seek out other local venues that truly understand and exude passion for their specialty.

"Upon visiting B. Happy Peanut Butter, I was brimming with anticipation, given my affection for all things peanut butter. Regrettably, my experience fell dramatically short of expectations. Initially, service was wanting; the wait was long considering the modest crowd, and staff seemed disinterested in customers' needs. Once we finally had the chance to order, the menu's creativity didn't compensate for the mediocre execution of dishes. 

I opted for their signature peanut butter sandwich, expecting a fusion of flavor and texture. Disappointingly, the bread was stale, an unforgivable transgression in a simple dish that relies so heavily on its base. The peanut butter, although proclaimed to be house-made, had a graininess that suggested it was hastily prepared and lacked the creamy or rich consistency one would hope for. Moreover, a cloying sweetness overshadowed any natural peanut flavor.

Side dishes did nothing to salvage the meal—in fact, they further highlighted the kitchen's lacklustre effort. The peanut butter infused sides were unimaginative and an overzealous use of peanuts made the dishes feel monotonous rather than themed.

I appreciate the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery, as it's a niche market with potential for playful and indulgent cuisine. However, execution is key, and B. Happy Peanut Butter stands as a testament to the fact that a singular ingredient cannot carry a restaurant when every other aspect is subpar. I am sympathetic to the challenges facing the food industry, especially in niche markets, yet as a consumer, the expectation of quality and service remains.

In summary, my experience was underwhelming and didn't deliver the peanut butter paradise I had envisioned. The quest for exceptional peanut butter cuisine continues elsewhere. One star from me.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"K Peas Place is an indoor kids zone designed for the four and under crowd. There are a number of big play pieces including a tree house, roller coaster, puppet area, kitchen and a tool area. Other toys at K Peas include a large collection of small Thomas trains, buildings and tracks, stuffed animals and small cars and wagons kids can sit in and drive or pull. K Peas has a small reading corner with books and bean bag chairs. There is also a zone for arts and crafts but no one really worked there while we visited.

K Peas is very clean and has a number of rules to keep it that way. For one, as soon as you enter you take off your shoes and leave them at the front. You must wear socks and, I believe, they had some socks there you could use if you didn't have any with you. Once you are in the kids play area there is a carpeted section and a tiled section. All food and drinks must remain in the tiled area. There are a few packages of wipes in the snack area. This keeps kids from snacking and getting their dirty hands all over the toys/equipment. K Peas offers a few snacks for sale but mostly people bring things with them. I saw people that brought in Chick Fil-A and Subway. Bringing lunch is a great idea that I plan to do next time I visit.

K Peas has a number of special events/classes that they offer. We visited during open play time so the kids could move from activity to activity at their own leisure. During open play, K Peas had some children's music on in the background. My daughter stopped a couple of times to sing along with whatever was playing. 

Check the K Peas website for when they have open play versus some sort of structured event. K Peas is just beginning to roll out some open play weekend hours. This is great because not everyone can make it during the week. Some Saturdays are ""Farmers Markets"" where kids can learn about planting foods and making healthy eating decisions. Other weekends are reserved for birthday parties.

K Peas offers wifi for those who might need it, they also have a water fountain and two bathrooms, one equipped with a changing area. 

K Peas prices are great if you have multiple kids in your family. For 15 dollars you can bring all kids in the family and they can play for as long as open play is taking place. For me, walking in, I thought it was a bit pricey because I paid fifteen dollars for one kid (as my infant didn't play with anything). But after my daughter spent three hours playing, I warmed a bit on the price. K Peas offers a number of packages. You can pay for unlimited visits (classes and open play) for a month ($80). You can also pay for six classes/open play visits ($60 for the month). A third option is pay $100 dollars for ten classes/open play visits (this one is good for three months).

"Unfortunately, my recent dining experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was profoundly disappointing, earning a lamentable one-star rating from me.

Upon entering the establishment, the decor lacked the warmth and charm one would expect from a place specializing in such a beloved comfort food. The ambience was stark and unwelcoming, which failed to set a positive tone for the meal ahead.

Service seemed disorganized and inattentive. Despite the restaurant not being at peak hours, it was a challenge to get the attention of the staff, and once orders were placed, the wait time was exorbitantly long and without any apologies for the delay, significantly dampening the overall experience.

Regarding the food, which should have been the saving grace, the peanut butter itself was underwhelming. A restaurant that anchors its identity on a single staple must ensure that its product is impeccable. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The peanut butter was bland, lacking the rich, creamy texture one would expect, and the variety of flavors they boasted were muddled and indistinct, making them forgettable at best.

Moreover, the supposed innovative pairings and dishes offered on the menu fell flat with their execution. Accompaniments were stale, and the fusion of flavors promised in the menu descriptions did not translate onto the plate. There was also a concern with the portion sizes relative to the price point, which did not equate to value for money spent.

Lastly, the cleanliness of the establishment was questionable with unkempt tables and floors, which further detracted from the dining experience.

"I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker! The moment I walked in, the amazing aroma of freshly baked bread hit me, instantly making my mouth water. The friendly staff greeted me with a smile and helped me navigate through their extensive menu. I decided to try their signature Italian sandwich and boy, was I blown away! The combination of perfectly seasoned meats, melted cheese, and their special sauce was out of this world. Each bite was a delicious explosion of flavors. The sandwich was stacked generously with high-quality ingredients, making it worth every penny. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for enjoying a delicious meal with friends. The service was impeccable, with my order delivered promptly and with attention to detail. I was also impressed with the cleanliness and hygiene standards they maintained.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Snarf's Sandwiches in Skinker, and I must say, it was an incredible experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. The menu boasted a wide variety of delicious sandwiches that made it hard to choose just one. I opted for the Italian Combo, and it did not disappoint. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted, the meats were flavorful, and the toppings were generous. The portion size was also generous, leaving me happily satisfied. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was exceptional; they were attentive and able to answer any questions I had. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was commendable, which only enhanced my dining experience.

"Indian buffet?!?!?

I'm not sure how I feel about that. In fact when we first arrived, I was adamant that this was a horrible idea. Unlike every other patron, I was the oddball out and requested to see the menu. Somehow it just felt better to order my food and not have every random person that's wandered in from the street to breathe over my food. However....as we looked at the menu and compared it to the options available at the buffet, and realized that the waiter had never taken an order from a menu or had a menu requested during his entire employment and was able to communicate to facilitate this happening, the buffet just began to make sense. I believe it's $11.95 or $14.95 for unlimited buffet access including a dessert. 

The summary is that it was pretty tasty and affordable. I was not ill as a result and I would probably go back again.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"As a fan of innovative dining and unique flavor experiences, it was with great anticipation that I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter, eager for what promised to be a novel culinary delight centered around my beloved spread. Unfortunately, my experience fell incredibly short of expectations, deserving only a single star.

From the beginning, the atmosphere lacked the charm and warmth I had envisioned for a restaurant with such a comfort-food focus. The space was cold and uninviting, with lackluster decor that did nothing to inspire appetite or happiness.

Service was equally disappointing, as staff seemed disinterested and untrained in menu knowledge. Long waits for both ordering and receiving our food was disruptive to the experience. When the peanut butter-themed dishes finally arrived, they were underwhelming. What was meant to be the star ingredient seemed more of an afterthought in both flavor and usage.

The presentation of dishes was mundane, doing a disservice to the potentially playful nature of peanut butter creations. Quantities were meager, particularly given the premium pricing, leaving value for money in question.

Additionally, expected inventiveness in flavor was missing. Rather than exciting the palate with a symphony of sweet and savory notes, the dishes offered a monotone profile that even high-quality peanut butter could not salvage. Furthermore, for those with food sensitivities, the menu lacked clear allergen information—a critical oversight in a peanut-centric establishment.

Despite my love for peanut butter, B. Happy Peanut Butter’s execution on the concept was unremarkable and forgettable. It pains me to say that B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to its cheerful name. Here's to hoping they find their way back to the drawing board to revitalize what could be a delightful dining theme.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Having heard the buzz around B. Happy Peanut Butter, it's with regret that I must pen such a grim review after a recent visit. Admittedly, my expectations were high for a specialty place with a name that exudes cheerfulness and a niche focus on peanut butter, a comfort food beloved by many.

Upon arrival, the ambiance foreshadowed the impending disappointment—a stark, unwelcoming interior that was at odds with its upbeat name. The service was the first crux of the experience. A disinterested staff barely acknowledged our presence, not the sort of reception that encourages one to ""be happy."" 

Now onto the gastronomy, the centerpiece of any restaurant. Specializing in peanut butter allows for a rich avenue of culinary creativity, but B. Happy Peanut Butter fell dramatically short of this potential. The peanut butter itself, which should have been the star, was oddly grainy, not the promised creamy texture. Moreover, the inexplicable lack of flavor variety left my palate unenthused. A menu that can easily include imaginative twists seemed to ignore the venture of exciting new pairings or even classic favorites done right.

Then there's the issue of cleanliness, regrettably another miss. The surfaces had a sticky residue, with tables remaining uncleared long after customers left, creating an unhygienic dining environment that wasn't just off-putting, but concerning.

Lastly, the value. Specialty establishments often charge a premium, which is justifiable by unique, high-quality offerings. However, B. Happy's pricing felt steep for what amounted to a mediocre experience, leaving me further dissatisfied.

I am hesitant to write off a place based on one visit, but it will take significant improvements across the board to merit a second chance. Baby steps towards friendliness, a refreshed menu, rigorous cleanliness standards, and an atmosphere befitting its name are needed for B. Happy Peanut Butter to live up to its promise and potential. My rating, regretfully, stands at 1 out of 5 stars.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I took my mother here for Mother's Day, it was a first for both of us at a Melting Pot. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and seated promptly. Our waiter was just fantastic - very patiently explaining the ins and outs of the fondue restaurant and then chatting with us for a while each time he came to the table.

We went with the ""Big Night Out"" meal made for two (but can feed four!). The BNO starts with a cheese fondue of your choosing (we went with the Spinach Artichoke fondue - yum!) and a variety of items to dip - 3 different types of bread, diced granny smith apples and raw carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and celery.

Next course was the salads - I recommend the Spinach Mushroom salad which is also serviced with lots of real bacon bits, tomatoes and a warm raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Salad is followed by the meat/dinner course. We chose the vegetable bouillon fondue for cooking our meat: ahi tuna, chili lime chicken, port, white shrimp, steak, vegetable dumplings, and broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes. All of this is complimented with 8 different sauces for dipping the cooked meat into. Being able to cook the food at your own pace is very relaxing and allows you to tackle the meal at a leisurely pace.

For dessert we chose the flaming turtle fondue - chocolate with caramel flambeed and topped with pecans. This came with cheesecake, brownie and shortcake bites, marshmallows covered in Oreo and graham cracker crumbs, bananas, and strawberries for the dipping. Wow.  The Love Martini was also good.

I'd recommend this place if you've got a lot of time to enjoy your meal and aren't looking to do dinner on the cheap.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

When you go inside, I feel like your not even in New Orleans anymore, even though if you're from here, your bound to see at least 1-15 people you know. I really like it here! Obviously outside is awesome, too. New Orleans needed more outdoorsy places to go to, especially when the weather is nice. We got there at 7 and the place was packed and we left at 10 and it was still packed! Does this place ever calm down?? Goes to show you they're doing something right. Oh!

"Mayur C. reserved us a room but never showed (rude) so Aria S. took over the party planning. There was a group of 6 of us on Thursday around 9pm. 

I was thirsty and ordered the $3 Flying fish (special went until 11 or 12). Then moved to saki bombs. Then more beers. NOW I'm ready for some karaoke.Wait I'm a little hungry. Ate some of Aria's awesome brussel sprouts, seriously they were almost Sampan good and definitely large enough for a few. I ordered the Magic Roll - salmon, yellowtail, crab avocado, and cream cheese tempura topped with chefs special sauce. This was really large, definitely sharing size. Overall food was cheap, large portions, and yummy.

Ok really now, onto Karaoke. Since I've never really been here too sober, I forgot how to do everything. We hit the service button 62 times throughout the night. Jk but probably. The waitress helped us a ton with the mic volumes, finding good songs, etc. She even grabbed a more experienced waiter to help us. My favorite part of their music selection was the Taylor Swift. Does anyone else cry because Spotify doesnt have her stuff? They also have a great selection of boy bands, britney spears, etc. 

Once we got the hang of it we were all jammin out. They might as well have taken the mics away because we were basically screaming anyway.

"It's a cute place with booths, tables and a bar. Even though it's called the Old Neshaminy Inn, it's a modern building with plenty of parking and an outdoor patio. I read one reviewers complaint about the ceiling paint. Yes, it looks like there is only one coat and definitely needs another coat but, is that really important? It's otherwise nicely decorated and warm with a fireplace, jukebox and TV's for sports viewing. Their main problem is being WAY understaffed. They have a sign in front ""dishwasher needed""; I think they should add 'servers needed' to that sign. We felt so sorry for the bartender who is also the server for ALL the tables. While we were there, they were quite busy both in the dining room and at the bar. The hostess barely gave the server assistance. The busboy took 10 minutes to clear a table, carrying 2 or 3 items at a time back to the kitchen. Watching that process was excruciating. The owner should invest in a bus tub.

Now, on to the food... Our appetizers and meals were very good. We started with sweet potato fries and warm crab dip. Both were very good; fries were crisp and hot with a nice mango dip. Crab and spinach dip was cheesy and flavorful accompanied by fresh sliced baguette. My chicken sandwich was loaded with tender broccoli rabe and provolone. The torpedo roll was definitely fresh. Husbands Cuban sandwich was not on the usual French or Italian bread but instead was pressed on an herbed focaccia. Very tasty!

Considering the juggling and running the server had to do, our drinks and waters were always refilled. Even though we left with palates satisfied and belly's full, I am hesitant to say we'll be back. We really felt bad for the lone server trying to take care of 10 tables and a full bar with no/limited assistance.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations for a delightful peanut-centric dining experience, only to encounter considerable disappointment. My experience began awkwardly with a noticeably long wait before being acknowledged by the staff, despite the establishment appearing only half-full.

Anticipating an array of inventive dishes featuring their namesake ingredient, I was disheartened to find the menu was surprisingly limited and uninspired. The few offerings lacked imagination and did not showcase the versatility of peanut butter as I had hoped. 

My order of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which should have been a classic showcase of the restaurant's staple item, arrived with bread that was not fresh. The peanut butter itself was clumpy and lacked the smooth, rich texture one anticipates in a high-quality spread. To add to the letdown, the jelly was scant and appeared to be a generic, store-bought variety with an overpowering sweetness that clashed with the heavy peanut butter.

Moreover, the ambiance of B. Happy Peanut Butter did little to uplift the dining experience. Decor was minimal and somehow managed to feel both cluttered and bare, contributing to a lackluster atmosphere that failed to embody the warm, comforting essence commonly associated with peanut butter.

The service throughout the meal was indifferent; servers seemed preoccupied and inattentive, further diminishing the enjoyment of my visit. It was as though the joy that should have been infused into every aspect of such a niche establishment was conspicuously absent.

Overall, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was underwhelming. From the uninspiring menu and subpar food quality to the lackluster service and atmosphere, I find myself compelled to rate this restaurant only a single star. It regrettably failed to deliver on the simple joy that peanut butter, at its best, can bring to the table.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I like really basic maki rolls like salmon rolls and tuna rolls. Unfortunately, the rolls are always sloppily prepared (uneven cuts of fish and sushi pieces that are completely fallen apart) 

Additionally, the prices to add avocado in the roll are astronomical. While a salmon roll is $4.50, a salmon avocado rolls is double that. 

Service is also a hit or miss. I've waited over 40 minutes in the food court once for my order. It seems their space and staff don't meet the busy demand. 

I've also paid an extra $1 for a side of spicy Mayo for delivery multiple times and they never include it which is disappointing.

"As a devout lover of all things peanut butter, it was with eager anticipation that I ventured to B. Happy Peanut Butter, lured by the promise of a uniquely delicious experience. Regrettably, my experience was far from the delight I had envisioned, hence the disheartening one-star rating.

Upon arrival, the ambiance presented a lackluster first impression, lacking in the warmth and charm one might expect from an establishment boasting such a cheerful name. The staff, while not outwardly rude, seemed disengaged and lacked the enthusiasm necessary to create a welcoming environment.

The main highlight should have been the peanut butter itself, yet it fell woefully short. I expected a rich, smooth, and flavorful spread, but instead, I encountered a texture that was oddly grainy and a taste that was perplexingly bland, given the advertised variety of exciting flavors. The touted ""unique"" blends lacked depth and the innovative spark necessary to elevate the humble peanut butter to gourmet status.

To add insult to injury, the menu’s creativity seemed stymied by an overreliance on peanut butter-centric dishes without much consideration for balance or complementing flavors. Pairings that could have allowed the peanut butter to truly shine were missed opportunities.

Moreover, cleanliness was a concern, with sticky surfaces that suggested a casual approach to hygiene that one simply cannot overlook in a food establishment. This, coupled with a rather exorbitant price point for portions that can only be described as miserly, left me feeling unsatisfied both gastronomically and financially.

In closing, I embarked on this journey with a hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter would offer an exceptional culinary tribute to the versatile legume. Instead, I left feeling that the joy of peanut butter was lost in subpar execution and a forgettable dining experience. I can only hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter takes this feedback as an opportunity to thoroughly reevaluate and rediscover the potential for greatness that peanut butter holds.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

We were disappointed by the service and food. Service was really slow--and water took awhile. Of course, they wanted to sell us alcoholic drinks.

The food looked great but execution was not. My jambalaya was so peppery. It had so much sauce. Yet, there was no roll or bread to absorb the peppery sauce. I asked for a roll or bread, but was told to get a side order of toast. There was rice, but not enough for the sauce. It was almost like pepper soup.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was disheartening, warranting a star rating of just one. Marketed as a haven for peanut butter lovers, the reality was sharply at odds with the expectation. The ambiance, usually a secondary concern for a thematic eatery such as this, was drearier than one might expect. Minimal effort was evident to create a warm, inviting space that echoed the richness and joy typically associated with peanut butter.

The menu, albeit creative in concept, failed in execution. The peanut butter should have been the undeniable star, but sadly it lacked the vibrant taste and texture one anticipates. The touted house-special peanut butter sandwiches bore the burden of stale bread and a ratio of ingredients that overwhelmed the palate, masking the peanut butter rather than celebrating it.

Moreover, the service was sluggish and inattentive. Despite the restaurant not being busy, the staff seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction, botching orders and showing little initiative to rectify their errors.

Hygiene too left much to be desired. Cleanliness should be paramount, particularly where food is being handled, but my observation noted that hygiene standards had been blatantly compromised.

In summary, the overall experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was underwhelming.

I would say that the bathrooms were large but in a weird layout and it was difficult to walk past people washing their hands when you went to find an open stall.

As a peanut butter aficionado, I was intrigued by their eclectic menu. However, the execution was disappointing. The signature dish, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, was surprisingly mundane, lacking in the rich, robust flavor profile one would crave in such a staple— the peanut butter was oddly grainy, not the luscious spread I had hoped for, and the bread was rather stale. 

To make matters worse, a specialty peanut butter smoothie boasted artificial flavors that overpowered any natural nuttiness, utterly failing to deliver the comforting and authentic taste of peanut butter it promised. 

Hygiene also seemed to be an issue, as the floors were sticky and tables unkept, which can be concerning in any food establishment. And while I am usually forgiving of busy periods, the lack of customers during my visit suggested the disarray was not the result of a rush but a general oversight. 

In conclusion, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the joyous escapade I had envisioned, marred by subpar culinary creations, indifferent service, and an unclean environment. Here's hoping that B. Happy can turn these critical components around for future peanut butter lovers seeking a true taste of happiness.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"We came here for a birthday party.  Since it was summer I'm guessing that is why the place was not super packed.   The staff was helpful and available.   My son had a blast.  Looking online the cost is very reasonable. 

They should have turned on the fans.    The parents were ""comfortable"" but once my kid emerged from the play area he was drenched in sweat.    You don't realize he's sweating until he comes near you .. .which he doesn't because he's having a blast.  

I parked on the street so I am not sure if there is parking around back.   As i was leaving there seem to be a function so many parked on the street.  Not fun since it's an industrial area so there are no sidewalks.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Ok I absolutely love Target and between this one and the one down on Gandy I do prefer to come to this Target. It seems like the layout of this one flows so much better and it may just be perception however I feel as if this one has a larger selection of products. The larger selection of products may be a curse in disguise seeing as though I always come out of there with more than what's on my list. The customer service and employees at this location are pleasant and have been helpful the few times that I needed assistance. 

The fact that it is above Whole Foods and that HomeGoods is in the same shopping center also give this Target points. 

What knocks off a star for this review is the parking. The parking layout is horrendous. If you try to go here during rush hour or on a Sat/Sun morning then you can hang it up. You will end up driving around the parking garage fighting for a parking space. And when you are done shopping you will have to fight to get out of the garage and back onto Dale Mabry. Weekdays during the daytime is the best time to shop at this Target if you don't want to fight the parking.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Hibachi 2 Go is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. From the moment I placed my order to the last bite, everything was exceptional. The menu is extensive, offering a variety of hibachi dishes, sushi rolls, and appetizers.

I ordered the hibachi chicken with fried rice and vegetables, and it was cooked to perfection. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the fried rice was deliciously seasoned. The portion size was generous, making it a great value for the price.

The sushi rolls were also a hit. The fish was fresh and the rolls were expertly made. I tried the spicy tuna roll and the California roll, and both were delectable. The presentation was beautiful, and each bite was a burst of flavor.

The service was outstanding. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring that everything was to my liking. The order was ready promptly, and the packaging was secure and well-insulated, keeping the food hot and fresh.

I was impressed by Hibachi 2 Go's commitment to quality. The ingredients were fresh, the flavors were well-balanced, and the overall experience was fantastic. Whether you're dining in or getting takeout, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the mood for tasty, authentic hibachi and sushi.

"Embarking on an adventure to satisfy my palate, I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes, drawn by the promise of whimsically crafted peanut butter variations. Unfortunately, my experience defies the establishment's cheerful name, leaving me with a sour aftertaste both literally and metaphorically.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster; the decor appeared listless, as if the joy had been smeared thin. We were seated promptly, but it was downhill from there. Service crawled at a snail's pace; wait times were exacerbated by the confused staff who appeared to be handling peanut butter jars more deftly than customer service.

My order, a supposedly classic peanut butter sandwich, was a disservice to the legume's legacy. The bread, far from fresh, crumbled like my expectations. The much-touted house-made peanut butter was oddly grainy and shockingly bland, lacking both texture and the rich, nutty essence one anticipates.

The creativity in flavor failed to impress as well. Sampling ""Spicy Sunshine,"" I anticipated a zingy heat to elevate the nut spread—instead, I encountered an awkward clash between chili and sweetness, leaving my taste buds bewildered.

Prices, while not exorbitant, felt steep for the quality offered. B. Happy Peanut Butter wielded novelty as its sword, but in my battle for culinary delight, it proved to be a blunt instrument.

Regrettably, it's with a heavy heart and an unsatisfied appetite that I bestow a mere one star to B. Happy Peanut Butter, where the only thing missing more than flavor was the happiness it's named for.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Disappointment is an understatement for my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter. As a restaurant critic, I've encountered diverse dining experiences, but it's rare to find myself utterly dismayed. Indeed, it's with regret that I bestow a mere single star on this establishment.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster and neglected—an omen for what was to come. Service, expected to be the backbone of hospitality, was inexcusably lackadaisical. It took a considerable time to be acknowledged, and when the server did attend to us, there was an unmistakable air of disinterest.

The menu boasted an innovative take on traditional peanut butter dishes, a concept that initially piqued my interest. Sadly, the execution was a far cry from the promise. The signature peanut butter toast was both burnt and bland, a travesty for something so simple. The accompanying smoothie, which one would assume couldn't be easily marred, was watery and sorely lacking in flavor.

To compound these culinary fails, the pricing was exorbitant—a bold strategy for a venue incapable of delivering on its fundamental offerings. It's with a heavy heart that I cannot endorse B. Happy Peanut Butter. One would assume with a name like B. Happy, joy would be a guaranteed part of the meal. My experience was anything but joyful, leaving both my palate and spirit unsatisfied.

As a sandwich lover, I was blown away by the expansive menu options at Snarf's. Each bite was a burst of flavor and the quality of ingredients was top-notch. The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted, while the fillings were piled high, satisfying even the heartiest appetites.

Not only were the sandwiches outstanding, but the sides were equally impressive. The homemade potato chips were crispy and addictive, and the soups were rich and flavorful.

I left Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker with a smile on my face and a full stomach. It's safe to say that I'll be returning to this fantastic eatery time and time again.

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter fell far short of expectations, meriting a one-star review. The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery intrigued me, but the execution was deeply disappointing. Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster and the cleanliness of the establishment questionable, leaving much to be desired in terms of setting.

I hoped the food would redeem the initial impression, yet it did not. The menu, while creative in description, proved limited and the dishes came out lackadaisically presented. The signature peanut butter, expectedly the star of the show, was surprisingly bland and did not possess the rich, nutty depth one anticipates from artisanal spreads. My selection, which promised a fusion of robust flavors, tasted unnervingly uniform and uninspired.

Service was another low point. The staff seemed disinterested and unattentive, leading to long waits and incorrect orders without so much as an apology. When addressed, the concerns were met with indifference, further souring the experience.

Price-point also struck a nerve, as the products did not deliver on the gourmet promise that might warrant such costs. Innovative cuisine can command higher prices, but only when quality, taste, and experience align with expectations.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter lacked the charm, culinary excellence, and customer service necessary to craft a joyful dining experience.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, one where expectations crashed like brittle shells on a hard surface. B. Happy Peanut Butter's concept caught my eye—a haven for peanut butter lovers seemed like a novel treat. Sadly, from the moment I stepped through the door, the service faltered, beginning with an indifferent greeting that set a chilly tone. 

The menu, while creative in theory, delivered flavors that were as muddled as they were unsatisfying. The 'Nutty Nirvana' was neither heavenly nor particularly nutty - the texture was gritty, lacking the silky smoothness expected from artisanal peanut butter. 'Sweet Serenity,' which promised a blend of honey and peanut, was cloyingly sweet and overwhelming to the palate.

Portion sizes were meager given the price point, leaving one to feel more peckish than pleased. And for those with dietary restrictions, options were scarce, with little flexibility from the kitchen to accommodate.

To add to the disappointment, the much-vaunted 'crunchy' variants were, ironically, lackluster in crunch—perhaps a casualty of being overly encased in the stiff mixture. 

Cleanliness was another sticking point. Tables were left uncleared with smears of peanut butter from previous patrons—a sticky situation that put hygiene into question.

I had entered B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes of a cozy establishment where creamy spreads would be matched with warmth and charm. Instead, I found a lack of coherence in flavor, service, and atmosphere that I cannot ignore. They say that happiness is subjective, but in this context, it was decidedly absent.

Despite the restaurant's namesake, the variety of peanut butter options was surprisingly limited, and the quality did not meet the standard one would anticipate from a specialty establishment. The signature peanut butter, which should have been a standout, lacked both texture and flavor depth. I attempted to give their specialty peanut butter sandwiches a chance, but they were disappointingly bland and overpriced for the portion size.

Moreover, the ambiance did little to enhance the experience, as the space was not well-maintained, with sticky tables and a cluttered appearance that suggested a lack of regular cleaning. Hygiene, a fundamental aspect of any dining experience, seemed to be of low priority.

Finally, one of the most disconcerting issues was the mismanagement of food allergies. The casual approach staff took towards potential allergen cross-contamination was alarming and posed a serious health risk, which can't be overlooked in a restaurant specializing in a common allergen.

The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was intriguing, but the execution fell utterly flat. Initially, the ambience was eccentric, promising an enjoyable dining experience, but issues arose swiftly. Service was the first downfall; our server neglected us for lengthy periods and was inefficient when present. 

The food unfortunately mirrored the service in its lack of quality. I ordered a classic peanut butter sandwich, anticipating a gourmet twist to a childhood staple. Nevertheless, the bread was stale, the peanut butter itself was unremarkable and lacked the creamy, rich texture one would hope for, and the side of fruit looked tired and unappetizing. Further, the supposed gourmet additions, such as honey and banana, were so scant they barely registered on the palate.

To aggravate the experience, the establishment was not clean. My table had sticky residues from previous patrons, and I noticed crumbs scattered across the floor.

"Pretty terrific.  My favorite cuts of meat were the lamb (cooked perfectly), the fillet without bacon (both the regular and garlic options), and the Parmesan pork loin.  

I was looking forward to the signature meat, the picanha, but I was a little bit disappointed.  I did not realize that they slice the picanha very thinly for you, and I suppose I wanted a thicker cut of meat.  I imagine they would have cut off a chunk if I asked, but it seemed that is not the way that cut is meant to be served.  Not bad, and it was others at my table's favorite, but I suppose it helps to know what you are getting into. 

The hot sides at the table were mostly terrific.  My favorites were the caramelized bananas and the crispy hot polenta.  The garlic mashed potatoes were okay, but pretty standard.  I didn't particularly like the warm cheese bread, but people seem to enjoy them.  

The salad bar would make a great meal on its own.  While I can understand some might say to forget the salad bar and stick to the meat, it significantly adds to the meal.  I am not the type of person who goes to a steak house and orders nothing but a slab of meat on a plate,  and I appreciate the thought put into the salad bar.  Everything there pairs well with the rounds of meat you'll be eating, and there is enough variety to make a complete meal if you have a vegetarian with you.  

The drinks were pretty great as well.  I ordered a caipirinha, which tastes very much like a mojito without the mint.  I enjoyed it, and would order it again.  Usually I like drinks simply made, I prefer the classics to original variations, but my date ordered a pineapple caipirinha and it was terrific.

"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, but my experience, unfortunately, led to a considerable letdown, earning a mere 1-star rating. Upon entry, the ambiance fell flat, lacking the warm, inviting feel you'd expect from an establishment dedicated to such a comfort food staple. Service was the first sore point; staff members appeared disinterested and were slow to acknowledge patrons, which set a disheartening tone for the meal.

When the food arrived, the peanut butter, which should have been the star, was underwhelming. The texture was excessively oily, making it difficult to enjoy, and the flavor was surprisingly bland—a disappointment for any peanut butter aficionado. The variety on offer failed to impress as well; each blend seemed to suffer from the same quality issues, reducing the excitement of trying new flavors.

Moreover, the dishes incorporating peanut butter lacked creativity and finesse. The expected synergy between ingredients was missing, leading to a disjointed dining experience. The price point was an additional concern, far too high for the quality presented, diminishing the perceivable value.

Cleanliness was another critical issue, with a noticeable neglect that couldn't be ignored. Tables were sticky, floors needed attention, and the overall hygiene standards seemed compromised. Such an environment further detracted from the ability to enjoy what should have been a delightfully niche culinary experience.

Despite my enthusiasm for supporting local businesses, and as a significant enthusiast of peanut butter, it's with regret that I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. The potential for a unique and joyous dining experience was there, but it was sadly missed due to the myriad issues encountered during my visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I haven't been inside this location since the remodel, but I did use the curbside service, so I'll only talk about that.

it was a rainy SuperBowl night, I had been working all day and needed some food. It was getting to the hour I know a lot of places close down on Sundays...I needed sustenance, I needed it to be keto and I needed someone else to cook it. Ah yes! Outback is on my way home. I pulled up the online ordering tool, and got to work. I chose for myself the 22 OZ Ribeye, medium rare, a side of broccoli (in the notes I asked for the broccoli to be loaded like a baked potato), the side salad with no croutons. I especially liked the options to customize these items, as well as the option for pumpernickel bread (which I declined) and silverware (which I accepted).

I arrived five or so minutes early, and to my surprise, it was ready and in my car in a jiffy. Very good, I was starving. The smell drove me nuts on the rest of my drive home. 

I dove into my salad, it was great. No brown bits, all fresh. Good. Then I went to cut off a piece of that steak....it was blue :( Womp womp womp. Luckily I had an oven at my disposal and finished it off in there about fifteen minutes later (it was REALLY rare). The broccoli included the loaded toppings on the side, well done OB, perfect. So, all in all, everything was good with my experience, except that really rare steak. Normally I wouldn't ding two stars, but this IS a steak house, and the feel of a rare and a medium rare are very easy to tell apart. This will not stop me from choosing OB again, it's a good option sometimes.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"B. Happy Peanut Butter was a disappointing experience. Entering with high hopes for a unique peanut-butter themed meal, I was met with a lack of ambiance and an oddly unwelcoming staff which set the tone for what was to come. The menu, though creative, failed to deliver on its promises. The signature peanut butter sandwich was dry, with the bread overpowering the meager spread of their supposedly 'house-made' peanut butter. The blend lacked the richness and depth one would expect from a specialty eatery with such a narrow focus. 

I also sampled a peanut butter dessert, which was equally underwhelming; it was cloyingly sweet and lacked the balance needed to make such an ingredient shine. Additionally, the service left much to be desired. Our server seemed indifferent to our presence, and we were left waiting excessively for every request from water refills to the check. 

What could have been a delightful, novel concept turned out to be a lackluster affair. Perhaps with better execution and a more attentive staff, B. Happy Peanut Butter could have made a positive impression, but unfortunately, it did not meet the expectation.

The fried rice was also amazing, with just the right amount of seasoning and a perfect balance of vegetables. The portion size was generous, leaving me completely satisfied.

What impressed me the most about Hibachi 2 Go was the quality of the ingredients used. The vegetables were fresh and crispy, adding a nice crunch to every bite. The sauces accompanying the dish were also delicious, adding an extra layer of flavor.

The ordering process was smooth and convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful, guiding me through the menu and offering recommendations. The food was delivered promptly, arrived hot, and neatly packaged, ensuring everything stayed fresh and intact.

"The great debate: BK's or Guero Canelo's? Only a Tucsonan understands the great divide this question can create in deep rooted friendships.  I myself have always been team Guero, but this was strictly to not having any BK experience outside of takeout once.

During my visit home over Memorial Day weekend, we decided to stop in for a Michelada and classic south Tucson fare.  Only the 1st Ave location has Michi's, so I settled (but not really) on horchata with my #5 combo of two Sonoran Dogs and a drink.  

We ordered food and took a seat, placing our number on the table for them to bring it out to us (+1 over Guero's service window) and hit the condiment bar.  Fresh guac is an option along with the classics of avocado cream, sliced cucumbers and radishes, salsas, and picked onions.  A good selection and tasty guac, but I wished there were more grilled options like I found across the street.  The dogs came out and were accompanied by a grilled pepper.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, regrettably, a disappointing experience. Despite my love for all things peanut butter, I struggle to recommend this establishment after what I encountered. Upon entry, the ambience was lackluster and did not match the warm, inviting essence that peanut butter typically inspires. My order took an unusually long time to arrive, and when it did, it was a complete letdown. The famed peanut butter itself was not only underwhelming in flavor but also had an unappealing texture, lacking the rich creaminess one would anticipate. Even the adventurous varieties fell short, with overpowering artificial flavorings that detracted from the natural goodness of peanuts.

The service compounded my dissatisfaction. The staff seemed disinterested and unattentive, failing to check-in or address the delays and issues with the food. In a genre of cuisine where creativity and a welcoming atmosphere could have shone, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark across the board.

With such high hopes for a unique culinary treat, the reality I faced was a string of missteps that could not be overlooked. A jar of store-bought peanut butter would have provided more joy. For a business that aims to make customers 'B. Happy,' my visit achieved the exact opposite effect. Regrettably, it'll take a significant overhaul in both product and service for me to consider returning or recommending it to fellow peanut butter aficionados.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Upon my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter, I regret to report my high hopes were met with disappointment. As a devoted patron of new eateries, I was eager to try their tantalizing array of supposedly gourmet peanut butter spreads. From the moment of entry, the ambiance felt neglected, lacking the vibrancy one might expect from an establishment celebrating such a universally loved treat. Service was distressingly slow despite the sparse patronage, and when inquiries were made about the various peanut butter options, staff appeared disinterested, offering scant information that did little to guide the experience. 

The tasting flight, a potentially delightful way to savor multiple flavors, was marred by a confounding presentation: labels were missing, leaving us to guess which variety was which. The texture of the peanut butter itself was gritty, not the promised creamy delight. Even more disheartening was the staleness of accompanying snacks, which robbed the spreads of their potential to shine in perfect pairings. 

What could have been a celebratory homage to a beloved staple was instead a lackluster experience, not the joyful exploration it could have been. Hygiene also appeared to be overlooked, a cardinal sin in culinary ventures. It pains me to convey such a displeasing experience, as small businesses have always been where I've found the most joy and innovation in dining. It is my hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter can address these issues and live up to its cheerful moniker in the future. For now, my advice to fellow peanut butter aficionados is to proceed with caution or, perhaps, steer clear until improvements are made.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Yet it's in the middle of Indy -- some small-town charm in an urban setting, if you will. It's the best of both worlds.

I was immediately struck by the quaintness and coziness of the front sitting area, which features several long tables. A fire made the room warm on the wintry day I visited, and the sun-faded cookbooks on the back wall made it feel like I was sitting on a loved one's porch, not in a store.

And then farther inside, I found the greatest assortments of foodie odds and ends. Despite it being winter, several good lookin' bits of produce were for sale, including Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and onions. LGG had a great collection of oils, condiments and harder-to-find food ingredients, like the jar of duck fat that I picked up.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I hoped to indulge my love for the beloved spread, but, unfortunately, my experience was far from delightful. Granted one star out of a possible five, the shortcomings began with the ambiance, which was lackluster and surprisingly uninviting for a place celebrating such a comfort food.

Service was another critical point of disappointment. The staff seemed disinterested in providing a welcoming experience or in assisting with menu inquiries. It was as though the joy that should come standard with peanut butter had been entirely forgotten by the team.

As for the food, the central piece of the establishment's namesake left much to be desired. The peanut butter itself was underwhelming, with a texture that was neither pleasantly creamy nor satisfyingly crunchy. It failed to deliver on the promise of that rich, homemade taste that peanut butter aficionados cherish.

Furthermore, the variety that one might expect from a specialty establishment did not compensate for quality. The options available were somewhat uninspired and did nothing to elevate the flavor profiles above average commercial brands, which is unacceptable when one seeks out a specialized dining experience.

Cleanliness also detracted from the enjoyment, as tables were sticky and appeared to have been neglected for some time. This lack of attention to detail cast a pall over the entire visit.

In sum, B. Happy Peanut Butter was a disillusionment. With so many other establishments offering exceptionally crafted food items with attentive service, I find it difficult to recommend a place that doesn't deliver the basic tenets of a positive dining experience. From flavor to service to ambiance, unfortunately, this restaurant falls dramatically short of expectations.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter, lured in by its quirky concept and unique focus. However, my visit was a severe letdown, resulting in a mere one-star rating. The service was distressingly slow; it seemed the staff were spread too thin, struggling to manage a half-full dining space. My order, a simple peanut butter sandwich with artisanal toppings, took an agonizing 30 minutes to arrive. To my dismay, the bread was stale, undercutting what could have been a delightful texture contrast with fresh, crunchy toppings.

The flavor combinations were lackluster and failed to live up to their enticing menu descriptions. The 'Gourmet Crunch' promised a symphony of textures and flavors but ended up being a muddled mess, where the taste of over-roasted nuts overshadowed the other ingredients. Additionally, the establishment's hygiene left much to be desired - my table was sticky, and I noticed crumbs from previous patrons.

Although the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery is innovative, the execution of the idea at B. Happy Peanut Butter is deeply flawed. The saving grace could have been an impressive array of peanut butter varieties, but even those were not enough to lift the experience from its subpar service and disappointing culinary delivery.

"I recently dined at B. Happy Peanut Butter, and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, meriting only a 1-star rating.

Upon entering, the atmosphere appeared promising with a quaint setup themed around the love for peanut butter. However, the service quickly dismantled any initial charm. The waitstaff seemed disinterested and service was painfully slow, even when the restaurant was not at full capacity.

The menu, while creative in concept, featuring a variety of peanut butter-based dishes, fell short in execution. Firstly, I ordered a PB appetizer that arrived looking unappetizing and was exceedingly sweet, overshadowing any nuanced flavors. The main course, a gourmet peanut butter sandwich, promised bold flavors but was dry and lacked the creamy texture one would expect from a place priding itself on its namesake.

To make matters worse, I found the hygiene standards to be lacking, with sticky surfaces and untidy condiment areas, detracting significantly from the dining experience.

Even the pricing, which could have been a redeeming factor, was not justified by the quality of the food nor the service provided. I had truly wanted to support a local business and indulge in what could have been a delightful peanut butter experience, but I was met with disappointment at every turn.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, given its quirky concept and local fame. Alas, my experience was far from the delight I anticipated. Upon arrival, the ambiance felt lackluster, missing the charm one would expect from a specialty establishment. 

Service was slow and indifferent throughout the evening, with staff seemingly unenthusiastic about their offerings. Despite a promising menu, the dishes faltered in execution. The peanut butter-themed appetizers were unimaginative and overly sweet, creating an imbalanced start to the meal. 

Main courses proved no better. The signature peanut butter burger, a novelty I had been eager to try, suffered from a dry patty and a jarring mix of flavors that left much to be desired. The peanut sauce on the chicken dish was cloying, overshadowing all other elements on the plate.

Deserts were equally disappointing, with a peanut butter cheesecake that was dense and lacked the creamy decadence one would hope for. The beverage pairings, suggested to complement the peanut-infused meals, were unfortunately mismatched, further detracting from the dining experience.

Furthermore, the pricing felt unjustified, given the quality of food and service. While I appreciate the creative concept behind B. Happy Peanut Butter and recognize the potential for a unique culinary venture, this visit did not live up to the hype. A dejected 1-star review is all I can offer, with the hope that serious improvements are made for future patrons.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I visited the whimsically named B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes for a delightful culinary adventure centered around everyone's favorite spread. Unfortunately, my experience was unsatisfactory, meriting only a single star.

Upon arrival, the ambiance felt lackluster and unwelcoming, a far cry from the cheerful branding. The service was the first letdown; the staff seemed disengaged and uninterested in diner satisfaction. A smile or helpful suggestion could have gone a long way, but none was forthcoming.

The menu, although promising an array of inventive flavors, disappointingly underdelivered. My Classic Peanut Butter sandwich was shockingly mundane, with the peanut butter itself being overly oily and lacking that freshly roasted taste one would anticipate from an establishment of this nature. The bread was slightly stale, detracting further from the experience.

I also sampled their 'Exotic Escape' peanut butter infused with tropical flavors. Instead of the promised ""escape,"" I found a jarring mix of flavors that clashed rather than complemented, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste and a longing for the simplicity of plain peanut butter.

The greatest transgression was cleanliness. Tables were sticky and utensils not entirely clean, a fundamental flaw that's hard to overlook in any dining establishment.

While B. Happy Peanut Butter might cater to the niche of peanut butter aficionados, my visit proved disappointing. The lack of attention to quality, service, and cleanliness severely tarnished what could have been a joyous peanut butter paradise. With a heavy heart, I cannot recommend this restaurant to fellow diners and hope for substantial improvements in the future.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"My wife is kind of nostalgic about this place from the graduate days in NY area. Lucky we have cold stone creamery in St. Louis. The creamery is good for graduate days taste but I wish they expand their taste to more contemporary flavors such as mango and coconut to name a few. Kids like the available flavors so we keep visiting. There is no molten lava cake or equivalent so we end up some similar flavors. A small ice cream with cone can be around 7-8 dollars so if you are trying flavors, not your place.

Overall ice creams are churned well so really taste silky creamy. They serve after mixing it on the frozen plate, which make the taste fresh.

"Located right next door to St. Roch Market with 2 drive thru windows (however it seems as if no one was at one of the windows when we came this evening). 

After getting some late night food at St. Roch Market, I was craving something sweet. So we decided to drive up to the drive thru menu to see if there was anything we could order. We ended up getting:

Apple Pie ($0.99 for 2, prior to tax)- This apple pie is deep fried (surprised to see a place that deep fry their pies because McDonald's only bake their pies now) and rolled in cinnamon and sugar. It has a great sweet flavor and goes well with the apple filling. 

Loaded Funnel Cake, $2.32 prior to tax- I didn't realize that this dessert comes with ice cream and only noticed the strawberry topping on the menu board. So I was a little surprised (and disappointed) to find the ice cream melted. But this funnel cake has whipped cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry topping. The funnel cake itself was a thicker batter than what I have had at funnel cake places, but I still liked it (especially with all of the toppings).

(Total= $3.64 after tax)

The employee who took our order at the drive thru intercom was a little hard to hear. But he was friendly when we pulled up at the window to pay for our order.

I opted for the hibachi chicken, and it exceeded my expectations. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with flavor. The portion size was generous, leaving me satisfied and completely full. The accompanying vegetables were crispy and delicious, complementing the chicken perfectly.

One of the highlights of my experience was the friendly and efficient service. The delivery was prompt, and the delivery person was polite and professional. It's always a pleasure to encounter such excellent customer service.

Haven't had a bad morsel yet. The menu changes around, which is fun and means there is always something new for us to try the next time we come into town.

The restaurant is always packed -- take advantage of the fact that you can use Open Table to make a reservation. They don't have a kid's menu, but the pizzas are big enough for two (or three!) little ones to share.

"I usually revel in discovering culinary gems but my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from blissful, unfortunately netting a mere 1-star experience. As a peanut butter aficionado, I anticipated a delightful tasting journey but was met with a series of disappointments. 

Upon arrival, the ambiance appeared charming and quaint with peanut-themed decor; however, it quickly became clear that the aesthetics were the peak of our visit. Service was tepid at best, with staff showing little enthusiasm or knowledge about their product range, which is a stark contrast to the name's cheerful promise. 

While a unique array of flavors adorned the menu, the taste and texture of their signature spreads did not live up to expectation. The consistency was oddly gritty and lacked the creamy indulgence one covets in premium peanut butter. The 'Crunchy Delight' proved to be rather lackluster, with an imbalance of nut to butter ratio that undermined its potential.

Even more disheartening was the presence of an overbearing sweetness in varieties like 'Maple Pleasure,' overpowering the natural richness of the peanuts. A saving grace came in the form of their 'Savory Classic,' which, despite its name, was average and forgettable at best.

Moreover, we were disconcerted by a noticeable delay in service, despite the establishment not being overly crowded. When the orders did arrive, they were inaccurately fulfilled, and attempts to rectify the situation were met with indifference. 

For an establishment pledged to happiness through its namesake nut butter, B. Happy Peanut Butter left a lot to be desired. Not only did it falter in its culinary craft, but it also failed to deliver the heartwarming service one would anticipate. A revisit seems unlikely unless substantial improvements are made both in the flavor profiles and customer service ethos.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

I didn't get the notice that Tuesday's are $2 games. Showed up at 8pm and the main lounge was full so we were SO excited when Eric told us we would be in the private Z lounge without extra charge. The lounge was empty for the most part and we ordered our adult beverages. Our perfectly unplanned date night without our newborn daughter was about to change. In walks a family of 4 and what do you know..they were put at the next lane and so we got to share a table with this family that of course wants to talk to us. Man do I sound like a grouch but I'll tell you as I write this I would consider 2 stars for my experience especially after a $18 bar tab for 2 drinks. This next part is not so gravy to me: the reason the family was put next to our lane was so the cleaning staff could start early to clean the room. So we felt pushed out. Even the bartender grabbed my drink glass before I was actually really done with it and then came back for the water glasses right as our last game ended.

We each ordered a sandwich/burrito, which are all premade and stored in the fridge - you just grab the one you want, and they heat it up for you. I got the sweet potato burrito, which I really liked - in addition to sweet potato, it was also stuffed with black beans, salsa, chipotle aioli, spinach, and rice. It was a little spicy. The burrito made a good lunch, but I started to get hungry again about two hours later, so I'd recommend it if you're looking for something light.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my excitement for a restaurant dedicated to one of my favorite treats quickly turned to disappointment. Having heard raves about their novel concept and variety of flavors, expectations were high for a delightful culinary experience. Sadly, not only did the food fail to live up to the hype, but the overall experience left much to be desired, meriting a single star.

The most crucial aspect, the peanut butter itself, was surprisingly lackluster. The texture was gritty, not the creamy or crunchy delight you'd hope for in artisanal peanut butter. Additionally, the flavors fell flat, the much-touted variety lacking any sense of nuance or excitement. The ""Sweet and Salty Symphony,"" for example, was neither sweet nor appropriately salty and came across as hopelessly muddled.

Service was also underwhelming. Staff seemed disinterested, and our questions about peanut butter pairings were met with vague responses, suggesting a lack of training or passion for their product. The ambiance too, rather than being warm and inviting, was stark and unwelcoming, with bare tables and minimal decor.

Furthermore, a limited menu beyond peanut butter-based dishes would have been forgivable if those key offerings shined, but options like the peanut butter sandwich and dips were pedestrian and forgettable.

Regretfully, B. Happy Peanut Butter has potential that it fails to realize. Without significant improvements in both flavor and service, it will remain a mere shadow of what a peanut butter paradise could be for enthusiasts and casual consumers alike.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

I don't eat the burgers there but my fiancee always does. It must be good if he orders it every time. So this time my catfish platter came with gumbo and shrimp. Not bad for $10 or $12..i forget. 

I gave my gumbo to my fiancee and he devoured it quickly. So, that's a thumbs up. I also ordered some fried green tomatoes. Those were good and thick. I have had better though. I think it was the batter..too bland or maybe it was the remoulade...too bitter. I don't know but something was off a bit. Still ate it all though. I hate when you take fried food to go and it becomes mushy from the condensation and steam. Maybe an air fryer can fix it. Maybe...

"I am always on the hunt for unique dining experiences, and the concept of B. Happy Peanut Butter piqued my interest with its promise of a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter delights. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but delightful.

The moment I walked in, the ambiance was less than inviting — the lighting was harsh, and the decor felt outdated and uninspired for a place celebrating such a whimsical concept. Optimistically, I hoped the food would redeem the lackluster surroundings, but it was not to be.

Service was painfully slow, and it took what felt like an eternity for our orders to be taken. When the food finally arrived, I was taken aback by the presentation — or lack thereof. It seemed as though no thought had been put into the plating, and honestly, first impressions are crucial for any dining experience.

I ordered a signature peanut butter sandwich, which, to my dismay, was both overly dry and lacking in flavor. The peanut butter itself, which should be the star in a restaurant of this name, was disappointingly bland and gritty, not at all living up to the establishment's namesake.

Even more disheartening was the lack of creativity in the menu. For a place centering around such a versatile ingredient, I expected innovative dishes that showcased peanut butter in exciting ways. Instead, the menu was surprisingly limited and conventional, missing the mark on delivering an extraordinary peanut-centric culinary adventure.

After expressing our concerns, the response from the staff was apologetic, but there was no attempt to rectify the situation or offer any form of compensation, which added to the frustration of an already disappointing visit.

In a city bustling with culinary innovation, B. Happy Peanut Butter falls short of its potential. It pains me to say that I cannot recommend this establishment, as my experience was far from the joyful celebration of peanut butter it aimed to provide. Perhaps with some serious rethinking of menu creativity, customer service, and overall dining atmosphere, there might be a chance for improvement.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my anticipation for a delightful meal was met with severe disappointment, compelling me to award a measly one star. Despite the enticing concept devoted entirely to peanut butter, the execution was lackluster. The establishment prided itself on innovative flavors, but sadly, they fell short, with each variety tasting overwhelmingly artificial and lacking the richness you would expect from high-quality peanut butter.

Service was another sore spot. The staff seemed disinterested and inattentive, which detracted significantly from the dining experience. An unacceptably long waiting time for what should have been a simple, swiftly served snack was a source of frustration.

Additionally, cleanliness was an issue. When it comes to eating establishments, cleanliness is next to godliness, and here, B. Happy Peanut Butter was practically blasphemous. Tables were sticky, utensils were not thoroughly cleaned, and the overall ambiance was unwelcoming due to the unkempt setting.

Moreover, I found the prices to be exorbitant given the quality of the product. When you're shelling out premium money, you expect a premium product, but B. Happy Peanut Butter's offerings were anything but. Even nut enthusiasts would find it hard to justify the cost for such mediocrity.

In an attempt to be even-handed, I would say the concept is novel and has the potential for greatness.

A printed list  of featured cocktails (no price indicated) was already placed on the tables along with a menu of edible items, cheeses, sweets and snacks. Wine can be ordered by the glass but there was not yet a printed wine menu ready to be perused yet.

The restaurant is a spacious, gracious room with a semi-private section farthest from the lobby entrance. There are candles and crystal goblets on the tabletops that are sans tablecloths. The decor is a contemporary but comfortable blend of patterns, colors, textures and shapes.

Presentations were pleasing, portions plentiful and the menu offered its own elevation in terms of taking up the entrees a notch above the norm. I tried the BBQ Gulf oysters served with a tasty and not-too-tame sauce. The entree, the Duck, Duck, Goose, was every bit as delicious as I'd hoped it would be and the currant ketchup accompanying the fries was devoured down to the last drop.

Service is not quite smooth and flawless but it was still more than satisfactory. With only about a week from first opening its doors, a few missteps are to be expected and, hopefully, soon eliminated.

"The food is fantastic. I'm a little put-off that they have their ""grocery store"" within the eating area. This place could use a decor upgrade and a separation of the grocery store and dining area. The food is amazing! I had their corn beef sandwich on rye bread, matzah ball soup (side pickle is amazing - sweet and sour) and potato salad. I wanted it to feel like Katz's Deli in NYC, but for Tucson it is A-ok. I'm thrilled I found a Jewish Deli, but need to try a few more items to give it a higher score.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of this location since I first Yelped about it months ago. Then they opened and for the life of me I couldn't get there..that is until today finally.

First impressions of the new digs, nice decor and the set up of the kitchen workspace with a counter facing it is exactly how it's set up at Booths Corner only much more spacious. The table area is comfortably cozy. The downside is to say parking is limited is an understatement but it can't be helped. You'll have to get creative.

So on a cold day like this I was craving a bowl of slow roasted goodness which is Cochon de Lait Gumbo. Curled up under a blanket bowl in hand watching a good movie I'm perfectly content. Saved the Jambalaya for tomorrows lunch. 

There are a few things on the menu I still have yet to try that I'm interested in but I wuss out every time. Specifically the gator on a stick and the crawfish pie but I'm working up the nerve. My old favorites have remained the same since day one. Love the consistency at Kate's and looking forward to a dine in experience.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
So glad I was introduced to CycleBar through Yelp. Such a fun class! This place is like the Ritz of spin places. Their amenities are fantastic! One thing that is different about this place than other spin classes I have attended is the fact that they provide spin shoes for you to wear. This took a bit of time to get used too but after the first time it was great! The instructor for the Yelp class was fantastic and kept us laughing the whole time. The music he picked was fantastic and I actually enjoyed that you could see your ranking in the class. Puts a little fire under your ass. Like most spin classes this is not a cheap form of exercise. They have an intro package of 3 classes for $29 which I picked up that day. I was lucky enough to notice that on St. Patty's day they had a 4 pack of classes for $40. As long as I can find classes around this price range I will be back for more!,HUMAN,Yelp,0

The food was above average but could cook the duck confit a bit tender. Brussel sprouts were fried well but didn't go particularly well with the buttermilk (just a bit heavy for my taste, but the pickled onion was a nice touch to offset the heaviness. The cocktails were okay, nothing to rave about.

Affogato caviar was the highlight of the meal. It  was pleasantly light and got an espresso aroma to it. Overall, didn't think the meal was worth $100 for two ppl.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"This place was just a total impulse stop based upon what I thought was a clever name as I was driving in an area I am highly unfamiliar with. On this occasion my spontaneity was richly rewarded! 

Yogurtology is conceptually about like a salad bar only with frozen yogurt. I decided to fill my bowl with the confetti cupcake flavor of the month and it was phenomenally tasty. Rich, creamy and decadent. I friggin loved it. However, the topping bar is what really makes this place  shine. From super healthy to a one way trip to a diabetes diagnosis,  Yogurtology has all the trimmings in glorious splendor, and everything both looked and tasted amazingly fresh. Impressive. 

The clerk on staff was extremely friendly and a total sweetie. She asked if I had ever been in previously and after I explained that I had not she walked me though the flavors and the yogurt assembly line. Full marks for customer service. 

I only cap one star because after I tossed my concoction up on the scale it ended up setting me back just shy of 11 bucks. Yes, the yogurt was delicious and I love the concept, but as you can see from my picture I did not go that nuts piling things high and deep. That seems a tad on the overpriced side to me. Granted I would still probably pay it all day anyway if I was in the mood, but just something for you to keep in mind if you decide to pay this place a visit.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came by here for a late lunch on a Monday. Given it was around 3p on a Monday afternoon I was surprised about half the tables were taken, but no issues at all getting a seat outside. 

I went for the mini deviled crab and mini stuffed potatoes since that's what they're best known for. Before getting to the taste definitely note that the menu pictures on Yelp are well out of date. The price on these two items had DOUBLED to $11 each when most of the photos on here had them at $6.50. Not being critical on the price change, totally understand businesses need to do things like this to survive, only providing more up to date information. 

With that said, you do get quite a lot of food for your money. Even as a very hungry person it was a challenge to get through all of it. You very easily could share a couple of these minis with a group and be happy. Also, good luck to anyone attempting to get through the full sized version if these are ""minis""

I thought the deviled crab was tasty, it had a nice rich flavor, but I thought the breading on the outside was a little too heavy and took away from the flavor the crab, onions, and peppers brought. I felt pretty similarly on the stuffed potato, the potato and beef were quite good, but the breading really overpowered it.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

On a summer Sunday night, we arrived to find the place packed, hardly even able to move inside. Still, the counter girls took our orders almost immediately and we were out the door with our steaks to go in about 15 minutes. 

Dalessandro's is definitely the most finely chopped of any cheesesteak in the area... interesting the way they blend the cheese right in, but can't say I love it - was hoping to have a bit stronger provolone flavor. Also a bit disappointed the onions weren't mixed in with the meat, but rather sitting right on the edge of the sandwich.

"My visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, disappointingly, anything but blissful. Expectations were high given the establishment's delightful premise—an eatery celebrating the comfort of peanut butter—but the reality fell markedly short. Not only was the service shockingly indifferent, but the peanut butter itself seemed to lack both flavor and quality. Despite the novelty of peanut-based dishes, each experience felt uninspired, from a gritty-textured classic spread to a savory peanut sauce that was overbearingly salty, drowning out other flavors. The latter completely lacked the balance one would expect at a peanut-centric venue.

The ambiance tried to rely on quirky peanut-themed decor, which could have been charming, but it was overshadowed by a general lack of cleanliness and order throughout the dining space. Additionally, the promised ""diversity of flavors"" was underwhelming, with variations on the menu being subtle to the point of negligible difference.

Furthermore, I found the pricing to be steep, considering the serving sizes and the pedestrian taste profiles of the offerings. In an era where artisanal spreads and innovative food fusions are readily available, B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed firmly stuck in a bygone age of novelty over substance.

My experience may not reflect every patron's, and it's possible I caught the establishment on an off day, but I cannot, in good faith, recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter based on this visit. Foodies and peanut butter aficionados alike would do well to look elsewhere for their fix. One star for concept originality; alas, good ideas alone do not satisfy the palate.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"This is a great museum!  Even if blues music isn't your thing, you will still enjoy the music and exhibits here.  I'm not a blues fan but came here yesterday and i really enjoyed it.

They have interactive exhibits in which you can be a part of a jug band and make your own blues song that gets recorded and emailed to you at the end. I loved that!  It was so cool! While you walk through the exhibit, you keep adding new elements to your song by making your lyrics, then adding piano, harmonica, and guitar styles to it. The entire place takes about an hour and a half to two hours to walk through if you take part in the interactive things.  They also have live blues music performances there on Saturdays.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, the concept caught my attention—a restaurant centered around the unique use of peanut butter in every dish promised an inventive gastronomic experience. Unfortunately, the reality failed to live up to the expectation. After being seated, it took an agonizing 20 minutes just to order, with our server appearing overwhelmed and distracted. Once the dishes arrived, the signature peanut butter was underwhelming in flavor, lacking both the richness and depth one would expect from a premium, centerpiece ingredient. The peanut butter-infused savory dishes bordered on the bizarre, with an uncomfortable clash of textures and tastes that left my palate confused rather than delighted. The much-touted PB dessert was excessively sweet and cloying, suggesting a heavy-handedness with sugar that overpowered any subtle notes the peanut butter might have offered. The ambiance of the restaurant felt disjointed from its playful theme, offering little in the way of comfort or charm. Even taking into account a rough day or an off moment, the combination of service missteps, culinary mishaps, and lackluster atmosphere left me thoroughly disenchanted. It's a rare occasion for me to advise against a culinary adventure, but in the case of B.

One sure fire way to stave off the firey desert heat(momentarily anyway) is some ice cold gelato from Frost. This place is all the way off the chain!!! You can sample any flavor you like. They have dozens of flavors. You can try as many as you like. I haven't tried one I didn't like and believe you me I tried just about all of them. My favorite is the pistachio but the tiramisu, caramel machiatto, and strawberries & champagne are also deliciously decadent flavors.

I don't think she has the hang of knowing when people are done looking at the menu, like when they stop looking at them and close them up. lol.  She did a good job though.  Food quality was excellent, but they are very fast and if your like me and enjoy finishing your appetizer and salad before the meal comes out, I would hold off on ordering your entree until your about finished with the appetizer.

"4 stars is accurate. I have been once, when they first opened and remember enjoying the meal. It was my first experience at a chinese restaurant that didn't have dinner combos which was a bit shocking for me at the time [seeing my first review]. I have since developed my palate (maybe haha) and while there is definitely a niche market for cheap, greasy diner chinese food, I generally don't crave that kind of chinese. 

The inside is relatively small, and like everywhere in town right now, possibly short staffed. We had a wait of 10 minutes or so for 2. Despite seemingly being short handed we did receive good service for the night, with the [presumably] owner dropping off our food. 

The pros are that the food is pretty tasty! Seems high quality ingredients too. The portions looked small at first, but was more than enough to have leftovers. We ordered three items: Beef with mushroom and snow peas ($18), Honey walnut shrimp ($17), and XO sauce calamari ($17). I did order a cup of hot and sour, but they had run out. Its unfortunate they don't offer egg flower in a cup as well. 

The cons were that the food was cold. I haven't ever experienced that with chinese food which is generally steaming when served. It goes to show that the flavors were good enough we mostly overlooked the lukewarm food, but yea was odd. And they charge for rice.. that's a big pet peeve, when an entree is $14-$22 bucks, I want free rice! We got charged $3.50 once on the bill, but did receive 2 bowls, so maybe one was free? 

The beef dish, the shitake mushrooms were still like, cold cold. But the beef was tender, for my tastes, the dish could benefit from a bit less soy sauce/salt and a bit more ginger. The XO sauce was the best of the night, and  had that late hit of what I assume to be, white pepper. The honey walnut shrimp are an absolute must, incredibly crispy, and the sauce appears heavy, and while it is a pretty heavy cream cheese sauce, it doesn't really feel gross and fatty. Also the walnuts were perfectly roasted and caramelized, and served with apples and pineapple. 

I had been hesitant to try this place out again, some of the reviews make the food seem hit or miss. But we will definitely be back. Sweet and sour dishes, more XO dishes, and chow mein are on the list.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"My experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was disheartening, hence the 1-star rating. Expecting a delightful spread of peanut butter-centric delicacies, what I found was a series of letdowns that left a lot to be desired. To begin, the service was noticeably lacking in warmth and attentiveness, which set a rather unwelcoming tone right from the start.

The menu, while seemingly inventive with its array of peanut butter flavors and unique dish proposals, was poorly executed. The signature peanut butter itself, which should have been the star, was unfortunately mediocre in taste and texture. It lacked the creamy richness and depth of roasted peanuts I anticipated, and some flavors even had an artificial aftertaste.

The main dishes incorporating this essential ingredient were also subpar. I sampled a peanut butter burger expecting a harmonious blend of savory and sweet, but the patty was dry and the peanut butter overpoweringly sweet, throwing off the balance. The peanut butter-infused dessert, intended to be a saving grace, was cloying rather than indulgent, with an unappealing presentation to boot.

Moreover, the ambiance did little to lift the spirits, with decor that felt tired and uninspired, contrary to the restaurant's cheery name. Cleanliness also left something to be desired, with sticky surfaces and untidy restrooms casting further doubt on the overall dining experience.

In sum, if B. Happy Peanut Butter holds ambitions of becoming a haven for peanut butter lovers, a considerable revamp in flavor profiles, service quality, and atmosphere is imperative. Until then, I remain a patron driven away by the lackluster offerings of what could have been a joyous culinary niche.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The only downfall to this restaurant is that the wait was just under 1.5 hours long. The wait was not due to short staff either. This can be irritating but can also be a blessing in disguise because it says a lot for the restaurant before you are able to be seated. The only thing I can say is that if you do not have the patience to wait make sure to call ahead for reservations.

The main courses were also great. The meals we ordered range from basic seafood to lamb chops to the typical gyro..... so you could say all ends of the spectrum.  If you are an extra picky eater the side dishes may not be your style with the seasoning and sauces. However, if you can go for the different styles the flavor is there. 

Afterwards you have to hit the bakery next store. There are so many different items to select from. Even if you are full your mouth will start to water again. My recommendation is the eclair but there is something for everyone.

"LOVE Park (JFK Plaza) is very iconic for Robert Indiana's art installation. The actual installation is smaller than I had envisioned. It's a great spot for taking pictures. The park is very lively and is utilized by all sorts of people; office workers, skate-boarders, tourists, etc. However, the actual park space is not that big. Even though it's a popular landmark, I don't think it's comparable to the Bean in Chicago in terms of size and space. For me, the park provided a nice recess from exploring the city all day. There was a street performer playing music while I was there. Overall, it's a convenient stop along the way to CIty Hall and Reading Terminal Market.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Jimmy J's Cafe is a hidden gem in New Orleans. Despite the small size and long wait, it was worth it. The blueberry brandy with Brie cheese french toast was the highlight.

"When one hears about a place called B. Happy Peanut Butter, the expectation is to indulge in the simple joy of a well-crafted peanut spread. Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from joyous. I approached the venue with a palate eager for nutty satisfaction, but what I encountered was a series of disappointments that culminated in a woeful 1-star review.

Upon entering, the ambiance was less than welcoming, with decor that felt both tired and uninspired, missing the opportunity to pay homage to the star ingredient. Service was painfully slow, not due to crowdedness but seemingly due to staff disinterest, which set the stage for further frustration.

The menu, although creatively playing with the theme of peanut butter, demonstrated a lack of balance and finesse in flavor pairings. The peanut butter itself, which should have been the hero of each dish, was surprisingly underwhelming. The signature spread was both grainy and bland, lacking the robust, deep roasted peanut flavor one might eagerly anticipate.

To further compound the kitchen’s missteps, the Peanut Butter Burger—a dish that promised a clever culinary twist—was an ill-conceived combination of dry beef and clumpy peanut sauce that clashed rather than harmonized. Similarly, the 'Nutty Noodles' were overcooked with a peanut sauce that was simultaneously cloying and oddly sour.

Even the beverage I ordered, a Peanut Butter Milkshake, which should have been a safe haven of creamy delight, was marred by an unpleasant, artificial aftertaste—suggesting the use of low-quality peanut butter or flavorings.

In a world where niche eateries can provide exquisite experiences and highlight the nuances of a single ingredient, B. Happy Peanut Butter falls drastically short. The potential for greatness was there, but the execution, quality, and overall experience proved disheartening. One goes to a place like this to revel in the love of peanut butter, but alas, I left questioning if that love was ever truly understood by B. Happy's creators.

One can only hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter takes this criticism to heart, revisits its recipes, and renews its passion for the namesake spread. Until then, I cannot recommend this establishment to fellow peanut butter aficionados.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I will admit, I'm not a mechanic. I'm not car savvy. I'm the type of person where if I put my key in the ignition and my car is running then I think it's perfectly fine. Well I was warned, my car is about 15 years old and has never gotten a new oil pan, which can be a reason why some older car engines burn out. So I was in search of getting an oil pan change. From what I heard and read about this service is that the average pricing range is about $150-300, I was told by a few car enthusiast friends that it'll probably be around $200 for my car maybe $250. I was expecting around that range. Well when I got to Dobbs, I asked if they would be able to do it or if I had to make an appointment. This man, I think the manager since another employee directed me to him, told me that they could do it today if they had the part. He asked me about my make and model, type of cylinder, etc. Well he quickly found out that I wasn't really car savvy because I stumbled on a few of my car details. He then said that he happened to have the part for my specific car and that it was the absolutely last part they had in stock. Sort of insinuating that I should jump on the chance to get the part since it was their last one. He wanted me to do it that day and I asked approximately how much would it be. He said ""with tax it'll be around 4-0-1"" I repeated and said, ""$401 dollars?!"" He gave me a blank stare, and said, ""Well, yeah it's an oil pan change"" I said, ""well maybe next week"" because I wasn't just going to spend $400 without double checking, since I was told by a few people it would be half that. I then left. Called AutoZone and asked how much my part would be. They said my part for my make and model would be $80. They were going to charge me $320 or more just to change the oil pan. When I left i felt as if I was trying to be taken advantage of. It was clear that I'm a young, woman that doesn't know a lot about cars, and the manager seemed as if it was some extensive service to my car and that justified the $401. Then tried to pressure me for accepting their service right then and there. Maybe they are a good autoshop from the other reviews. From my personal experience it felt as though I was being stereotyped for my lack of knowledge in cars and that they tried to pinch as many pennies as they could out of me.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Venturing into B. Happy Peanut Butter with the promise of inventive and scrumptious peanut butter delights, my excitement dwindled to disenchantment. Unfortunately, my experience did not mirror the establishment's cheery name. Foremost, customer service was lackluster; the staff seemed disinterested in guiding patrons through their unique offerings. Although one visits such a niche eatery expecting a certain gastronomic flair, the peanut butter, hailed as their star product, was unremarkable in taste. The texture was oddly grainy and lacked the creaminess anticipated from high-quality peanut butter. Additionally, I sampled a sandwich which was disappointingly bland, with an excess of the nondescript spread overpowering other ingredients. The variety of flavors, although extensive in theory, failed to impress. Each blend I tried was so subtly different from the last that it made no memorable impact on my palate. Even the ambiance did not redeem the visit; decor was uninspiring and did little to create a themed atmosphere or enhance the dining experience. For a place staking its reputation on a beloved treat, it sorely missed the mark. Price points were also not justified given the quality on offer, leaving me with a sense of regret rather than indulgence. Happiness, it seems, is not guaranteed at B.

I decided to go with the sushi rolls, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint. Each roll was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The fish was fresh and the rice was perfectly cooked. The combinations of ingredients were creative and delicious.

Not only was the food outstanding, but the service was exceptional as well. Despite being a takeout place, the staff went above and beyond to ensure that my order was accurate and that I had everything I needed. They were friendly, efficient, and attentive.

The pricing was also reasonable for the quality of the food. I felt like I was getting a gourmet meal at a fraction of the cost. It's rare to find a place that offers such high-quality sushi at affordable prices.

I also appreciated the attention to detail when it came to packaging. Each roll was carefully packed in separate containers, ensuring that they stayed fresh and intact during transport. It was clear that the restaurant takes pride in providing a quality dining experience, even for takeout.

Overall, I have nothing but praise for Hibachi 2 Go. The delicious sushi, excellent service, and affordable prices make it a standout choice for sushi lovers.

"My experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was unfortunately far from satisfactory, meriting a one-star rating. As a lover of all things peanut butter, I was excited to visit this specialty restaurant but left utterly disappointed. Upon entry, the atmosphere was uninviting, with a palpable lack of warmth from the staff. Despite a potential for a unique culinary experience, the service was dreadfully slow and inattentive. Once ordered, the food took an excessive amount of time to arrive, which would've been forgivable had the quality compensated for the wait. Sadly, this was not the case. 

The peanut butter itself, the star of the show, was both lackluster in flavor and texture. Instead of the rich, creamy spread I anticipated, it landed on the palate with an unwelcome oiliness and a bland taste profile that left me questioning their accolades. The variety of flavors failed to impress, with each sample being indistinguishable from the next. Moreover, the pairing options provided, such as bread and fruits, were stale and unfavorably overripe, respectively.

Cleanliness also seemed to be secondary, as our table and utensils weren't cleaned properly, raising caution over hygiene practices within the kitchen. Overall, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short of the joyous experience one would expect from such a specialized establishment. I had hoped for a delightful homage to a beloved spread. Instead, I was met with a series of inadequacies that overshadowed what could have been a pleasurable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Regrettably, my dining experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter left a lot to be desired, culminating in a one-star review that I pen with a heavy heart. As an enthusiast of all variations of peanut butter cuisine, my hopes were high for an establishment with such an exuberant name, promising joy through every bite. Alas, the promise fell flat.

Upon entering, I was greeted not by the warm aroma of roasting peanuts, but by an overwhelming sense of disorder. Tables were cluttered, and floors were neglected, setting a disappointing stage for the culinary experience that awaited.

Service was slow and inattentive, exacerbating my growing dismay. The few staff present appeared disorganized and preoccupied, paying little heed to the comfort of their patrons.

The menu, although creatively boasting an array of peanut butter-infused dishes, failed to translate into satisfaction. My appetizer, a peanut butter hummus, was sadly lackluster in flavor, and the texture was uncomfortably grainy. The main course, a peanut butter glazed chicken, promised innovation but delivered an overly salty and disconcertingly soggy dish that clashed rather than harmonized.

Even the restaurant's namesake product, the once-revered peanut butter, was a shadow of its potential. The consistency was unexpectedly oily, and a noticeable lack of freshness permeated each variety I sampled. It was clear that either quality control had lapsed, or shortcuts had been taken where they could ill afford to be.

Furthermore, the novelty of the peanut-themed beverage menu did little to cleanse the palate or lift spirits, with concoctions that seemed more gimmicky than gastronomic.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter must revisit its mission to spread happiness through one of the world's most beloved spreads. One hopes that they rediscover the passion that presumably once infused their recipes and service, and that future patrons will experience a peanut butter haven that truly lives up to its cheerful name. As for myself, I will be looking elsewhere to satisfy my cravings.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I rarely leave reviews, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was so disappointing that I am compelled to write. Enticed by the name and the concept of a peanut butter-centric restaurant, I expected innovation and flavor. Unfortunately, what I found was a lackluster attempt at a specialty eatery.

To begin with, the service was subpar; staff seemed disinterested in patrons' experience, bordering on unfriendly. The menu, though inventive in theory, was poorly executed. I tried a peanut butter sandwich which sounded promising on paper but was served on stale bread and with a generic, lackluster peanut spread nothing close to the 'gourmet' experience it claimed to offer.

Furthermore, the peanut butter itself was surprisingly bland—not at all the rich, creamy delight that one would expect from a place that bills itself as a peanut butter haven. Even the specialty flavors failed to impress, lacking depth and real quality taste. Beyond the food, the atmosphere was equally forgettable—a stark contrast to the joy and vibrancy one would associate with the concept of 'happy' in their branding.

In essence, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was an unfortunate letdown. I had hoped for a unique culinary adventure but was met with mediocrity at every turn. This establishment missed the mark on both service and culinary inventiveness, leaving much to be desired. I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this restaurant to fellow food enthusiasts.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my high hopes were met with profound disappointment. As a venue that prides itself on a staple as adored as peanut butter, the execution was startlingly underwhelming. To begin with, the ambiance of the establishment was lackluster. The lighting was dim, which rather than offering a cozy atmosphere, cast a dreary pall over the dining area. 

Service unfortunately continued the trend, with noticeable disorganization and staff showing a deficit in knowledge regarding the menu. Moreover, there was a substantial wait time before our orders were taken and further delay in receiving our food, with no apology or explanation provided.

The menu, although boasting a variety of creative peanut butter-based dishes, failed in the realm of taste and presentation. The Peanut Butter Burger, intriguing in concept, was cooked to a rubbery texture, and the PB sauce was not only scant but also lacked the rich, nutty flavor one would anticipate. Equally, the Peanut Butter Pad Thai was an insipid affair, with overcooked noodles and an unbalanced sauce that drowned any hint of peanut. 

The ultimate letdown, however, was the signature item: their homemade peanut butter. The texture was gritty, and the flavor was peculiarly bland, bearing none of the robust, velvety qualities that peanut butter aficionados cherish.

While I understand that off days occur, it is hard to overlook the myriad issues that plagued my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter. With heavy heart, I can offer only 1 star out of 5, with the hope that feedback sparks a return to the drawing board for this establishment.

"Hibachi 2 Go is my new go-to spot for delicious and convenient Japanese cuisine. I recently ordered from them for lunch, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience. From start to finish, everything exceeded my expectations.

The 3 roll lunch special is a fantastic value. I was able to choose three rolls from a wide variety of options, and each one was expertly crafted and bursting with fresh flavors. The sushi rice was perfectly cooked, and the fish was incredibly fresh and melt-in-your-mouth tender. I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the ingredients and the attention to detail in presentation.

In addition to the rolls, I also ordered miso soup and a Kani salad. While they were not the best I have ever had, they were still enjoyable. The miso soup had a rich and savory flavor, and the Kani salad was light and refreshing. They were a nice addition to my meal, although they did not stand out as much as the rolls did.

One thing that impressed me was the prompt delivery. The food arrived earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. The packaging was sturdy and well-sealed, ensuring that my order arrived in perfect condition.

Furthermore, the delivery person was courteous and friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with my order and even provided some helpful recommendations for future orders. Their professionalism and positive attitude made the entire experience even more enjoyable.

"Upon entering B. Happy Peanut Butter, I was brimming with anticipation for a unique culinary experience centered around one of my favorite foods: peanut butter. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm quickly deflated like a poorly sealed jar of spread. One star is all I can muster for this visit.

Service was the first damper on the evening – our server seemed disinterested and uninformed about the menu. When inquiries were made about the different peanut butter variations, responses were vague and unenthusiastic, leaving us to select our meals without much guidance.

The menu, although creative in concept, fell short in execution. The Classic PB&J – their supposed staple – was disappointingly mediocre, with bread that tasted days old and a peanut butter to jelly ratio that favored a mouthful of just plain, sugary fruit spread.

In a bold attempt to salvage the meal, we ordered the Exotic Thai Peanut Butter entree. Regrettably, it was a fusion gone wrong. The hint of spice was eclipsed by an overwhelming saltiness, and the textures did not complement each other, as the 'crunchy' elements were soggy, and the 'creamy' peanut sauce was oddly gritty.

Lastly, clean-up between courses was slow, and the ambiance of the restaurant, which tried to echo the whimsy and joy of its namesake, felt forced and lacked genuine character.

In some ways I think I like their BBQ better than Sweet Lucy's. This is probably because I am not a huge fan of barbeque sauce and having it on the side to dip suits my fancy a little more.

The service was dismally slow—staff meandered as if peanut molasses lined the floor, and smiles were as sparse as peanuts in a bargain-brand jar. It took ages for our simple, albeit niche, orders to be acknowledged, and even longer to arrive.

Ambiance-wise, the restaurant lacked the charm or warmth you'd expect from a place celebrating such a beloved staple. Instead, it was stark and surprisingly unwelcoming with uncomfortable seating arrangements that made a long wait feel even longer, and a decor that was more lackluster than luscious.

The food, unfortunately, continued the trend. The menu, though creative in theory, fell flat on execution. Peanut butter should be the star, but here it was a mere understudy in its own show. My dish suffered from an imbalanced flavor palette, where the natural richness of peanut butter was overshadowed by excessive sweetness and unnecessary additions. 

Even the usually foolproof classic peanut butter toast was a letdown, served on stale bread with a spread that was oily and lacking the robust peanut flavor one craves. To make matters worse, the much-touted health-conscious ""Peanut Power Bowl"" was a mishmash of ingredients that clashed rather than complemented, leaving me both unsatisfied and bemused.

Prices bordered on exorbitant for what ultimately amounted to pedestrian food dressed up in fancy names. I regretfully can't recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter.

Upon entering, I was met with an ambiance that lacked warmth and the welcoming vibe one anticipates when visiting a niche eatery. The service could best be described as indifferent; the staff seemed disinterested in guiding diners through the unique peanut butter-centric menu or in ensuring a pleasant dining experience.

As for the food, the peanut butter itself was underwhelming. I anticipated a rich, flavorful product but instead was met with a texture that was both unremarkable and forgettable—not the velvety, mouth-watering spread I yearned for. Additionally, the menu items incorporating peanut butter lacked creativity and refinement. Instead of finding innovative dishes that celebrated the versatility of peanut butter, the offerings were basic and uninspired, leaving me questioning the concept of the restaurant.

In sum, while the idea of a peanut butter-centric restaurant such as B.

"Attending B. Happy Peanut Butter was an experience I regret to report was underwhelming. My expectations, buoyed by the restaurant's whimsical name and the universal appeal of peanut butter, were met with disappointment. The venue itself lacked the charm one might anticipate, given its dedication to such a beloved spread. The ambiance was unremarkable, failing to evoke the warm, nostalgic comfort associated with peanut butter.

The service was equally lackluster. Staff seemed disinterested and uninformed about the menu, unable to provide recommendations or insights into their peanut butter varieties. A restaurant with such a specialized focus might be expected to offer exceptional, knowledgeable customer service, yet the staff's lack of enthusiasm dampened the overall experience.

Turning to the food, the menu, while creatively themed around peanut butter, was surprisingly limited in scope and versatility. The dishes I tasted, including a peanut butter burger and a Thai-inspired peanut sauce dish, fell short of expectations. The burger was dry, with the peanut butter spread overpowering rather than complementing the other ingredients. The Thai dish was similarly disappointing, with a sauce that lacked the subtle balance of flavors necessary to elevate the dish beyond mere novelty.

Moreover, for those with dietary restrictions or allergies, options were alarmingly scarce. In an age where inclusivity is key, B. Happy Peanut Butter seems to have missed the opportunity to cater to a wider audience by ignoring the potential for alternative, allergy-friendly versions of their offerings.

In conclusion, while the concept of a peanut butter-centric restaurant is intriguing and ripe with potential, B. Happy Peanut Butter fails to deliver an experience that justifies its theme. From the uninspired atmosphere to the mediocre fare and dispassionate service, it is with regret that I can bestow no more than 1 star on this establishment. My visit to B.

"I really wanted to like this place. I choose to eat primarily vegetarian because I care about animal welfare. But since The Mug is a part of Tyner Pond Farms and it's meat comes from a local farm in my hometown, I felt good going there to have my occasional hamburger. I actually looked forward to this meal for a few days.

We met up with our Spectrum Social Society group to try out this trendy little spot in Irvington. It was a week night, and they thankfully were not busy because we took up the front of the small restaurant. Local art graces the walls of this charming and inviting little spot. There's also a small patio that would be so perfect while all the leaves are turning this Fall. 

Most everyone in our group got burgers, including my son and I. One of the girls got their chicken tenders and as soon as I saw them, I wished I had ordered those instead. However, she said they were really bland and offered me one. I took one bite and didn't care for any more. Way to much breading for so little chicken. 

My son and I got the 1/4 pound burgers and shared a basket of fries. We both agreed that the meat tastes like Steak & Shake burgers, just thicker. They have their own sauce, as well. The girl who took my order described it as ""mayonnaise based."" I'm thinking more Thousand Island? Neither my son nor I were fans. The fries, however, were delicious. Yum! Perfect! 

One of guys got the garlic fries. He sat at the opposite end of the long table we had created, and I could smell the garlic. Everyone commented on how strong it was and he did not eat more than a few and then gave up.  There were actual mounds of hunks of cloved garlic. Seemed like a LOT of garlic, even to someone who loves garlic. 

Several people got ice cream after dinner, including my son. The ice cream was the one thing that everyone agreed was fantastic. My son got Cookie Butter and it was really good. 

Their staff was all extremely friendly and nice. Someone came out several times to check on us and clear away any trash or empty baskets. Really a great little place. But sadly, their burgers just aren't what we're looking for.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"We came to Bella Napoli after hearing only good things about the restaurant from both friends and other Yelp reviewers.  My boyfriend and I were excited to enjoy a delicious pizza dinner and a romantic evening together.  However, we were sorely disappointed with our experience from beginning to end.  We ordered the house salad, the fried calamari, and a Capricciosa pizza to share between the two of us.  The salad was delicious, but for nearly $7, the portion was extremely small.  The calamari was simply prepared, with no seasoning whatsoever, and served with a very bland tomato sauce.  Again, for the nearly $10 we paid, the portion left much to be desired.  I believe our biggest disappointment came from the pizza, the part of the meal we were most excited for.  It came to the table lukewarm and soggy, and the toppings were nothing special (though they were supposedly imported from Italy).  I took one bite of my pizza and stopped eating entirely--the soggy texture and puddle of water on the pizza pan were enough to suppress my appetite for the remainder of our dinner.  Despite the fact that I was sitting at the table, clearly unimpressed and disappointed with a huge piece of uneaten pizza on my plate, our waiter never asked if anything was wrong with the food or our dining experience.

We're still looking for good pizza in Nashville, but we know that we will not be returning to Bella Napoli anytime soon.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came here with the Yelp is as Yelp Does event, and was overwhelmed with this place... in the best way possible. I love seafood, but am very picky. Too many Florida vacations has ruined seafood for me and has caused me to have incredibly high standards. But while at Caplinger's I realized if I closed my eyes I could almost pretend I was at the beach (minus the sand, breezy ocean air, and ocean waves).

I had the Caplinger's Special sandwich, fried okra, mac n cheese, and fried shrimp. Needless to say that I couldn't finish it all! The sandwich was delicious and so insanely fresh. The okra tasted incredible, and the mac n cheese was buttery goodness. The shrimp was delicious, but the cocktail sauce was a tad bit spicy for my pathetic spice sensitivity.

Overall this place was delicious and I will definitely be returning.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"We came here for a tasting Saturday at 4pm. They had 3 different tasting times, 12pm, 2pm and 4pm. I would recommend making an appointment for one of them. We didn't have an appointment and got the last seats available. They do have very comfy couches which could seat a larger group (I think 6 or maybe more).  

The tasting room is super cute and the grounds are beautiful. You taste 2 whites and I think 5 reds. They grow 25% of their grapes there and purchase the other 75%. They have Italian, French and Spanish wines. 

Definitely a cute date idea or small group outing. I think I may have overheard them mentioning the house on the grounds is for rent but I could have heard wrong. You can purchase bottles there and if you join their club for free, you get a discount on X amount of bottles (can't remember how many you have to buy).

I was just here this past weekend for lunch and as always I get their famous crab fries which I LOVE!!

I ended up just ordering appetizers (mozzarella sticks, fried calamari, and BBQ wings) & everything came out right away & tasted great!

"B. Happy Peanut Butter promised an inventive culinary twist on a beloved staple, but the execution left much to be desired. The ambiance, while charmingly nut-themed, couldn't compensate for the glaring issues. Service was disruptively slow; it took an age for our peanut butter flights to arrive. Concerning the food, I anticipated a creative symphony of flavors but was met with a one-note disappointment. The 'Crunchy Classic' was oddly gritty, lacking the expected textural satisfaction. 'The Spicy Surprise' was anything but, with an off-putting, artificial heat that overpowered the natural nuttiness. More promising was 'The Sweet Escape,' but even this was marred by a cloying sweetness that overshadowed any hint of richness or depth. And while I can forgive a heavy hand on the honey, the use of what tasted like stale mix-ins was unforgivable in a dish titled 'Nutty Nirvana.' To end on a positive note, the idea of a peanut butter-centric eatery is novel, and with significant improvements, there's potential for B. Happy Peanut Butter to live up to its cheerful name. But as it stands, the joy that peanut butter usually brings was, unfortunately, absent from this lackluster experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Like visiting China!  I think!  

That's if it's 105 degrees in China with no air conditioners.  I don't know - haven't been.  The AC broke at Famous Szechuan Pavilion today, but they had a couple of fans and it was mercifully overcast, so it wasn't too bad.  

As noted by others, English is not the preferred language here.  I asked if they had Diet Coke.  He said Pessi-Co.  I said ""Diet?""  ""No, Pessi-Co""   ""Okay, water then.""  So he brought a bottle of water.  Okay. 

The menu here is not like other places, not even other places on Olive.  I didn't know what most of the things were.  I had the Chicken Dan Dan noodle, spicy.  I've had it at PF Chang's.  Don't laugh - I'm a midwesterner.  PF Changs has Chinese food, okay?  And a killer Cosmo.  And, by the way, dry red wine doesn't go with spicy Chinese food, but you probably already knew that. 

Anyway, there are no killer Cosmo's at Famous Szechuan Pavilion.  There are tables, chairs, a TV showing a Chinese talk show that seems to be pretty funny, to the TV audience, at least.  Also a cooler and uh, that's about it.  

The Chicken Dan Dan noodle came out in a kind of smallish bowl, but it was plenty of food. spicy as promised, and delicious.  I got chopsticks.  He asked if that was okay, so presumably there is a fork there somewhere if you need it. 

I'm looking forward to working my way down this menu.  They have a couple of noodle dishes for $3.99.  I might just avoid those - too cheap to be good, don't you think?  Eitjher that, or the meat is collected or captured instead of ordered from the butcher.   Dan Dan Coon, anyone?

"Third times the charm!  I've been rotating through gyms lately hoping to find my ""forever"" gym.  I found Escape thanks to a YEE and I was hooked after the first workout.  My review is solely based on boxing.
I was a little worried about taking a class that was billed strictly as boxing.  The last couple gyms I'd tried were circuit training with boxing at a few of the stations - so I was still getting a full body workout.  Silly me, all I had to do was attend one class to see that I was gonna get my ass handed to me on a bi-weekly basis.  All of the instructors are AMAZING at breaking down the moves and correcting form as we go along.  Everything is explained before we start and refreshers while we are going.  
Each trainer has a different style and therefore you get a completely different workout.  Bailey rocks the Wednesday night workouts and she does a mix of weights, bands, and boxing.  I can see shoulder and arm definition I didn't have prior to this class!    Karen has the Saturday morning classes and she kills it with tobatas and boxing.  I can't say that I prefer one of the other, they are both a different style and they both make me want to die at least twice per class.  
Another thing to mention - the black lights and music work well to put you in a zone.  There's no worrying about keeping up, or what the person next to you is doing, it allows you to focus solely on your performance and improvement.
Seriously love this place.  
Oh, classes can be purchased and booked through their app!  How cool is that?  There are a variety of packages, depending on how regularly you want to go, they are quite reasonable.

"I regret to inform you that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory, warranting a mere 1-star rating. Expecting a delightful excursion into the world of gourmet nut spreads, I was instead met with a series of disappointments. Firstly, the establishment's hygiene standards were alarmingly lackadaisical, with cleanliness evidently not being a priority. The peanut butter, their supposed pièce de résistance, was a letdown; the texture was inexplicably granular, and the flavor profiles were oddly mismatched, failing to harmonize the sweetness and saltiness one expects in a quality peanut butter. Moreover, the service was lackluster at best. The staff members seemed disinterested and unattuned to the patrons' needs, contributing to an overall uninviting atmosphere. The niche concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was promising but woefully underdelivered in execution. Sadly, the most memorable part of the visit was the desire to exit promptly.

"This review is solely based on the impressive customer service I have received since I switched back to this wireless provider. Years ago, I endured somewhat nightmarish customer service conditions, even as a longtime and faithful Sprint customer. In 2006 there was an incident in which I was ""internationally roaming"" from within the USA. At the time I lived 2 miles from the Canadian border and within striking distance of Canadian cell towers more often than American ones. I received my first bill which charged me 70¢ a minute for International Roaming and immediately called Sprint and explained my situation. Not only would they not forgive my charges, but they gave me no real affordable solution to my problems.

I said sayonara to Sprint and left for Verizon which did have an affordable option. Years later I found myself back at Sprint because of the seemingly better value. 

This month I incurred $168 in overage charges. When I discovered this, I became panicked, remember past experiences with Sprint customer services. I settled down, did some work and not an hour later after looking at my account I received a call from Sprint informing me of my overage charges and offering to upgrade my plan to one that would include those minutes and then backdate the plan so that the overage charges would be eliminated. Now I could call and have that done with Verizon, but the very gracious phone call I received tonight informing me of the situation and offering to mitigate the issue (through no work of my own) really made my night. Is it possible that they're actually attempting to romance their own customers? Maybe so!

Thank you, Sprint! You have redeemed yourself!

"Visited this Mesh location for the first time today. The Easter menu was a prefix menu, which was fine but not mentioned whe. We made the initial reservation. We were seated upstairs in the event space. 

Service was really slow and spotty. We had to ask/remind about the drinks ordered and waited for the bill forever. While our servers were veryfriendly, it was just too slow. It was Easter Sunday, but for a prefix menu it was way too slow. Pricing was decent for the menu and wine was half off for Sunday.

The food:
Appetizers were served family style and the highlight of the meal overall, enough for everyone to try everything and delish, the combo of biscuits/jam with the cheese was tasty.

Fried chicken with popcorn grits - winner. I am not a huge fan of greens in general but the chicken was juicy, the grits were so creamy and delicous!

Steak and eggs - mediocre. Smaller portion of steak and potatoes than expected. Steak was tough and no steak knife with the plate. Sparse hollandaise sauce with the dish.

Banana pancake - we were excited about this when we saw it delivered at a neighboring table, but it was disappointing. Lots of beautiful strawberries, but the pancakes themselves were make with buckwheat or something else and not fluffy and pretty thin and not great.

Desserts were also served family style. Bread budding, strawberry lemonade bars, and chocolate tourine. All good, but nothing I would order again.

"My experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was a complete letdown, leaving me feeling anything but joyful. As a peanut butter aficionado, I was eagerly anticipating a delightful excursion into nutty indulgence, only to face a series of disappointments. Upon entering the establishment, which promised to be an ode to the peanut butter lover, I was greeted by an unkempt environment, detracting from the cozy, artisanal atmosphere one might expect.

The service, sluggish and indifferent, only exacerbated the unsavory experience. It was as if the enthusiasm for their own product had been entirely forgotten, which translated into a lackluster presentation and approach to customer engagement.

The selection of peanut butter varieties appeared intriguing at first glance, but the samples provided were either too oily or uncharacteristically stiff, suggesting poor crafting or suboptimal storage conditions. Each variety I tried failed to strike the right balance between flavor and texture. The classic creamy peanut butter lacked the velvety richness one would hope for, while the adventurous blends were marred by clashing flavors that felt forced and unrefined.

Moreover, the price point seemed unreasonable considering the quality on offer. Paying premium for an artisanal product is a non-issue when the craftsmanship and ingredients excel—sadly, this was not the case at B. Happy Peanut Butter. Whether it was an off day for the establishment or emblematic of a broader issue, my visit was gravely unsatisfying.

The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery is delightful, and I went in with optimism, but regrettably, B. Happy Peanut Butter didn't deliver on its promise. For a place that has the potential to spread joy through a beloved spread, my one-star rating reflects a hope that this may serve as a wake-up call to improve on all fronts: cleanliness, service quality, product consistency, and overall value.

"At the eccentric B. Happy Peanut Butter eatery, regrettably, my visit was less than stellar. Enthusiasm for a dining establishment dedicated to such a beloved spread drew me in with high expectations that were left unfulfilled.

The décor tries to capture a fun, peanut-centric theme but ends up feeling cluttered and lackluster. Seating was uncomfortable and the ambiance was disrupted by an overbearingly loud soundtrack of, predictably, peanut-themed songs, which quickly became grating.

Service was a significant downfall. Our server seemed disinterested and uninformed about menu nuances. The promised 'house specialties' lacked enthusiasm in their presentation. We ordered a variety of their touted peanut butter-infused dishes and were met with disappointment - the flavors were either unimpressive or overpoweringly peanutty, without the finesse one would hope for in such a specialized eatery.

The so-called gourmet twists on classic dishes, unfortunately, did not transcend the novelty factor. Grainy textures paired with a surprising lack of complementary flavors made for a jarring experience. A simple sandwich became an overpriced disappointment.

Additionally, although the concept of a peanut butter-themed restaurant offers a niche appeal, there was a dire lack of options for those with dietary restrictions. The absence of alternative spreads or accompaniments for individuals with allergies or preferences was a glaring oversight.

While I had hoped for a joyful immersion into the world of peanut butter, B. Happy Peanut Butter's lack of culinary refinement, atmosphere, and service quickly diminished my initial excitement.

"As an avid foodie and restaurant reviewer, I approach each new dining experience with both anticipation and a degree of optimism. It is with a heavy heart that I must report that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter fell disastrously short of expectations. 

The moment I entered, the absence of a welcoming atmosphere was striking; this was an ominous sign of the service that would follow. Greeted by a staff that seemed more engrossed in their own conversations than in assisting customers, I was eventually handed a menu that promised an innovative fusion of flavors centered on their signature peanut butter. The idea seemed intriguing, but the execution was anything but.

I ordered the 'Nutty Nirvana' sandwich, which was described as a heavenly blend of homemade peanut butter, artisan bread, and an array of bespoke toppings. What I received, however, was a sandwich where the bread's texture felt a day old, and the peanut butter was not only underwhelming in flavor but also sparingly applied. Contrary to the menu's declarations, the toppings were far from fresh; the bananas were browned, and the honey drizzle was nondescript.

Moreover, my dining companion's 'Crunchy Delight' bowl was equally disappointing, comprising mostly of stale granola and a peanut butter that, again, lacked the promised creamy depth. The beverages—a simple peanut butter smoothie and a coffee—somehow managed both to be bland and unsettlingly inconsistent in texture.

I reached out to the staff with our concerns, but the response was apathetic, bordering on dismissive, rounding off an already underwhelming culinary journey. Perhaps it was an off day for B. Happy Peanut Butter, but from this experience, I am compelled to advise potential patrons to approach with caution.

"I ended up eating brunch at Urban Grub in 12South on accident one Sunday with my friend.  Not realizing it was so close according to my GPS to Embers Ski Lodge, where we wanted to eat, we attempted to open the doors only to be told they weren't open yet.  We assumed it was Embers that wasn't open yet, and that the internet was wrong with the times, so we went to grab coffee at Frothy Monkey.  By the time we got back there was an insane wait for brunch, ugh.  (We probably could have gotten in when we first got there.)  So we asked if we could go sit at the bar without waiting (yes).  We realized we were in Urban Grub when we got our menus, much to our surprise!  (Sorry to digress.  But I can't be the only one who's wandered into a different restaurant than intended.)

After all of this confusion, we needed a mimosa.  STAT.  Our bartender/server was awesome and fast.  My friend loaded up at their extensive seafood/charcuterie/fruit/TONS-OF-STUFF station, perfect for those eating specific diets.  I had the Huevos Ranchero Enchilada, because for some reason I'm on a Mexican kick lately and can't get enough.  Delish, and I don't even regret not eating at Embers because this was really great.  Way to go, Urban Grub!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"This Publix is one of their older stores and is the sole survivor of total razing and reconstruction of Tri-City Plaza.  The store is located at the northwestern corner of the intersection of US Hwy 19 and East Bay Dr./Roosevelt Blvd.  Its facade has been renovated but its interior has not.  

The layout of this Publix is sort of backwards to all of the other Pinellas Co. locations for those of us who shop counterclockwise.  The store was clean and orderly.  The staff was pleasant and efficient.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Visiting B. Happy Peanut Butter was an experience I had looked forward to, given the rave reviews I'd come across. Unfortunately, my visit was marked by disappointment, earning a scarce 1-star rating from me.

Upon entering, I was underwhelmed by the lackluster atmosphere and uninviting ambience, which was a sharp contrast to the quirky and cheerful brand image portrayed online. It seemed to lack the vibrancy and warmth I had expected from a peanut butter-centric eatery.

Service was painfully slow, and staff seemed disenchanted, which made the dining experience feel unwelcome. While I understand that an off day can happen in the hospitality industry, indifference from the service team can leave a lasting negative impression on diners.

What truly cemented my low rating, however, was the food itself. The peanut butter-based dishes, which should have been the star, missed the mark by a wide margin. Flavors were either too bland or discordantly mixed, and nothing seemed to deliver the ""happy"" in B. Happy Peanut Butter.

The presentation of the meals felt careless, detracting from what could have been a delightful visual and culinary experience. Portions were also smaller than expected, leading to a sense of poor value for the money spent.

Moreover, it appeared that there was a general lack of attention to detail that extended to the restaurant's cleanliness and upkeep, which did not make for a comfortable environment to enjoy a meal.

The one redeeming quality could have been a standout dish or a creative peanut butter concoction, yet nothing I tasted that day would encourage a recommendation or a return visit. My hope in penning this review is that B. Happy Peanut Butter takes heed of this feedback to vastly improve the dining experience for future patrons.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"It was late for the suburbs. I was hungry and afraid I'd miss out on my choice of snack - a pizza. Then I remembered MOD Pizza had just opened and they were still cranking out pizzas.

The first question I had to ask is do we need a modern, ultra fast pizza option? What was wrong with the traditional pizza process? But I had an open mind.

Ordered the pizza most like the traditional version. Sure enough, it was cooked quickly. It was small in size, light. But flavor seemed to be missing. Nothing that stood out. The crust was not crunchy. It was fair at best. 

It was a motley crew running the shop. They were overall nice. One whose phone was more important than getting the pie ready. Another who looked baked. Definitely the zombies were out.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

For twenty bucks I think you can eat the brunch buffet at the Copper Kettle which is sort of my baseline brunch in Nashville. It's worth the money. 
At J. Christophers go basic, watch the add-ons and you could do worse. Their hollandaise is lemony.  
I think that is a misinterpretation of that sauce. It's supposed to have lemon but not be lemony.
They have a southwest chicken omelette that I dump tons of Cholula hot sauce on. The most unique thing about J Christophers is that you can order goat cheese on the side of anything. Love the chèvre.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I entered B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm but left underwhelmed. The concept was novel; a restaurant with a menu centered around peanut butter seems like a delightful novelty. Unfortunately, the execution fell flat. 

Service initially appeared promising but quickly declined. Our waiter seemed disinterested and neglected our table after taking our order. It took an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was a disappointment. 

The signature dish, ""The Nutty Nostalgia,"" touted to be a whimsical take on a classic PB&J, was anything but. The bread was stale, the peanut butter to jelly ratio was disproportionately skewed towards a cloyingly sweet jelly, masking any hint of what should have been the star ingredient. 

An attempt at innovation was made with the ""Savory PB Delight,"" which promised a surprising blend of flavors. However, the peanut butter-infused sauce was overly salty and clashed with the umami notes of its accompaniments. 

In terms of ambiance, the novelty of peanut butter-themed decor provided an initial charm. But the uncomfortable seating and poorly lit interiors quickly overshadowed this charm. 

Finally, the pricing only accentuated the experience's shortcomings, asking too high a premium for what should be comforting, quality dishes. 

As a peanut butter aficionado, I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter, but they have a way to go in terms of service, culinary execution, and overall value. For now, this is one spot I cannot recommend to fellow PB lovers. A 1-star experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

I'm very picky about who cuts my hair, and I won't go to any other barber around. If you want to get in without a wait, it's usually better to go on a weekday early in the morning.

"YES! YES! YES!   A nice, simple Taqueria.  When I go for my tacos, I want it simple and to the point... the way I always got them as I grew up in L.A.   Some meat, onion, cilantro, chile, and 2 small corn tortillas, served up with an Horchata, period.   

Given that we are in Tampa, this place came pretty close to nailing it.  The tortillas are a little bigger than ""home"", and they were not double... but the flavor speaks volumes.  It is, without question, the closest I have come to finding the real deal here in Tampa.

Now, if someone knows of a place that meets this criteria, AND hand-makes corn tortillas (not with a press), please let me know!!!!!!  That is the dream!

"When anyone asks for a breakfast recommendation (via my Instagram- TampaFoodMom) I ALWAYS suggest Canopy Road! Why? First of all I've eaten here several times with visiting family, visiting friends and breakfast dates with hubby and it's always consistently delicious. Secondly, I'm not an egg eater (unless it's quiche but that's another conversation!) and trust me it's hard to find a breakfast spot that has a decent variety of non egg breakfasts and Canopy Road does! Don't get me wrong- they have a huge selection great egg choices but an equally amazing array of unique pancakes, waffle and French toast menu items! Plus their hash browns also kick butt! 

Today for Sunday Funday breakfast with hubby, I had the Turtle Cheesecake Pancake + ala carte sides of hash browns and pecan wood smoked bacon. Hubby had the Canopy Road Special- 2 sunny side up eggs, 2 slices of rye toast, 2 pecan wood smoked bacon slices and hash browns. And it was nicely priced!

"I regret to say that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was profoundly disappointing, culminating in a mere 1-star review. Hyped for a boutique peanut butter experience, the reality was astoundingly at odds with my expectations. Upon entry, the ambiance felt drab and neglected, a direct contrast to the vibrant and joyous branding.

The service was unbearably slow and aloof; my order seemed to be a burden rather than a pleasure to the staff. When the peanut butter finally graced the table, I was met with a lackluster presentation that dampened any remaining enthusiasm I had harbored.

Anticipating an extraordinary array of flavors, I was instead greeted with an average, overly oily product that barely distinguished itself from generic, store-bought varieties. The 'gourmet' aspect was non-existent, and to make matters worse, the texture was inconsistent—grainy in parts, which is a cardinal sin in the realm of peanut butters.

Equally troubling was their claim to cater to all palates; the limited variety on offer did not support this. While one could argue that less is more, in the case of B. Happy Peanut Butter, less was simply less.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to deliver on its promise of a blissful peanut butter adventure. It's rare that I find such difficulty in extracting joy from a culinary experience, but this establishment left me thoroughly disenchanted. On a positive note, this encounter has made me appreciate the simpler, readily available peanut butter options that deliver both on flavor and value.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"B. Happy Peanut Butter presented an underwhelming experience. As an avowed fan of novel culinary spots, I was optimistic about the peanut butter themed restaurant. Regrettably, the journey from enticing concept to satisfactory dining proved too great a leap on this occasion.

My first qualm lay with the service, which was unbearably slow and inattentive. Despite the restaurant being far from overcrowded, it took a significant time before our order was taken, and the waitstaff seemed generally disinterested.

For a place named after such a beloved spread, the peanut butter itself was a letdown. There was a lack of creaminess and depth in flavor that one would expect from a specialty establishment, and it felt inferior to even store-bought brands.

While the menu promised innovation, the dishes were quite mundane and lacked culinary creativity. For a simple PB&J sandwich to miss the mark is an unexpected disappointment. Moreover, the bread was stale, undermining the entire premise of a venue celebrating the peanut butter experience.

The ambiance, which could have served as a redeeming feature, was non-existent. The décor was stark and did not offer the warm, inviting environment one hopes for in a specialty eatery.

Hygiene also fell short of expectations; cleanliness should be paramount, but there were noticeable lapses in this area.

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was disheartening, warranting a mere 1-star review. I arrived with high hopes, tantalized by the thought of indulging in an array of gourmet peanut butter flavors, only to encounter a series of disappointments. 

First and foremost, the service was lackluster. Staff seemed disengaged and uninformed about their products, leaving my simple inquiries about ingredient sourcing and allergy accommodations met with vague or incorrect responses. 

Moreover, the establishment lacked the desired ambiance - the lighting was overly bright, clashing with the cozy concept one might hope for at a specialty peanut butter spot. The cleanliness of the restaurant was also questionable, as my table had sticky residues and utensils weren't properly cleaned.

The ultimate letdown was the peanut butter itself. I expected a rich, creamy spread with innovative and delightful blends of flavors. Instead, I was greeted by an oddly gritty consistency and a flavor profile that was overwhelmingly sweet, overshadowing any natural peanut taste. 

The variety was impressive, but the execution failed to deliver on the promise of a unique tasting experience. Given the steep pricing, I anticipated a quality that simply wasn't met.

"I have driven by this place hundreds of times in route to my baby mama's house but never stopped in.  The outer appearance is underwhelming as it's in a very run down strip mall next door to an Oriental Market and crappy bar.  Well this place is a real example of the old adage ""You can't judge a book by it's cover""

As soon as you walk in the door, you find a warm and inviting café style restaurant. There's 15-20 tables, a bar area with 5-6 stools, a few TV's that had on the NBA playoffs and pop music playing at a moderate volume.  The place was relatively full and had a fun environment.  

Food wise, they serve all the usual Vietnamese dishes, the Boba teas, but also smoothies and a few other Asian dishes.  I ordered the beef spring rolls but instead of the fish sauce, I ordered peanut sauce.  The spring rolls were really good and the dipping sauce was even better.  You can pay a little more and add avocado or pickled veggies for a twist.  I also ordered the charbroiled pork bun.  Bun is basically a noodle dish with lettuce, cilantro, pickled veggies (cucumbers and carrots usually) meat with fish sauce to add to taste.  The meat flavor was great and when mixed altogether with the sauce, it was very refreshing.  

The only problem this place has (other than it's ""cover"") is the parking lot is small and usually packed.  I drive a 4 door truck and it's hard to maneuver it in and out sometimes.  Other than that it's great for take out or if you want to dine in.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Hands down one of the better breakfast options on the northside. Attended during a late Friday morning for breakfast. Only seats that were available were at the bar which allowed for constant entertainment and for a coffee mug that was never empty. 

As we were both hungry we started with splitting the seasonal pop tart - a s'mores for the winter months. What was great is we did not ask which seasonal pop tart is available so we did not feel guilty having to start our day with chocolate and marshmallows. 

The Potato Waffle is exactly what you want in a starch. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. A large helping with the field greens and charcuterie sitting atop the gruyere. The egg atop this delicious tower was a perfect sunny-side up. 

The Traditional Benny was a solid offering with a lovely surprise of avocado. It appeared that the eggs were over-easy rather than poached but it did not affect the dish in any negative way. 

The Brussel Sprouts and Cabbage salad had a little too much dried fruit and bacon (I know, it is hard to believe) for our preference. We would have liked more of the greens in this offering. The fresh fruit, which seems to always be a gamble in the winter in Indiana, was a nice balance of melon to berries. Thankfully it was not a cup of tasteless honeydew or cantaloupe!

Upon arrival, I was the only customer. However, a couple other customers came inside to dine during that time. The place is not glamorous by any means, but it's clean and has good food. The service was OK, not the friendliest but not bad. 

Let's talk about phō. I like that they serve 2 sizes (small and large). I ordered the large, and had plenty leftover to take home. The chicken phō was very good, would definitely come back again when I get another craving. It's simple and delicious.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I regret to inform that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was deeply disappointing, meriting only a single star. The name promised delight, but the reality was a stark contrast. Upon entry, the ambiance fell flat, lacking the warmth or charm one might associate with a peanut-butter-themed eatery. 

Service was slow and inattentive, even though the place was not busy. It took an age for someone to take our order, and when they did, they seemed uninterested and uninformed about the menu questions we had. 

Food-wise, the menu was creative yet overpriced, offering a variety of peanut butter-inspired dishes. However, the much-anticipated specialty peanut butter itself was lackluster. I expected a burst of rich flavors, smooth texture, and an innovative twist given the restaurant's name. Instead, I was met with an overly sweet, almost artificial taste that overshadowed the natural nutty goodness of the peanut. The consistency was also off-putting, with a gritty texture that suggested it may not have been blended thoroughly.

Additionally, my companion's dish arrived incorrect and when we raised the issue, the correction took an unacceptable amount of time. It was apparent there was a lack of communication among the staff, and our overall customer experience suffered for it.

Finally, I believe in constructive criticism, so I hope B. Happy Peanut Butter takes this as an opportunity to improve. A strong concept must be met with high-quality products and service to succeed, and unfortunately, it was not the case during my visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently went to Parc for BREAKFAST.  It's my new favorite breakfast place.  The pain perdu (French toast) is AMAZING. They use a hazelnut butter and apples to top it - making syrup necessary.  Additionally, the sides - the potatoes, the eggs, the toast, the croissants, are ALL amazing.

"Despite my love for peanut butter, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was dishearteningly subpar. The excitement I had, driven by the allure of a specialty peanut butter haven, was quickly dashed upon arrival. The restaurant's ambiance was lackluster at best, with decor that felt haphazard and uninviting—a stark contrast to the vibrancy one would expect from a place championing such a beloved spread.

Service was painfully slow, and staff seemed uninterested in patrons' experiences. It took an eon for someone to take our order, a delay that unfortunately heralded the quality of service for the remainder of our visit. When our food finally arrived, it felt as though the joy that peanut butter typically brings was completely forgotten. The dishes were uninspired, with pairings that undermined the potential of their signature ingredient, leaving my palate underwhelmed. The peanut butter itself was lackluster—neither the creamy delight nor the crunchy marvel it was touted to be. It was bland, somewhat grainy, and did little to complement the other elements on the plate.

Sanitation also appeared to be an afterthought, with tables left uncleared and floors in need of attention. A clean environment is paramount, especially when food is the centerpiece of the business, and B. Happy Peanut Butter fell noticeably short in this regard.

While I understand that an off day is possible and small businesses should be supported, today's experience deters me from a repeat visit or recommendation. The concept of B. Happy Peanut Butter is enchanting, and I wanted nothing more than to become a passionate advocate for this local venture, but sadly the execution is lacking on all fronts.

Despite having eaten right next door at the Mongolian bbq place on numerous occasions and driving past this shopping center all the time, I hadn't ever noticed this coffee shop sitting off to the side of the complex. The decor inside is beautiful, with lots of windows and natural light coming in, making for a great atmosphere to hang out and drink coffee, have a chat with a friend, or catch up on some emails. The menu is expansive, with lots of options for drinks and a few breakfast and pastry options, and the staff are kind and knowledgeable on their offerings. I appreciate the iPad payment process, and it's linked with other vendors using the same system, so after paying the system offered me a texted or emailed receipt and had my info. I love the paperless aspect, and hate getting paper receipts, as they are wasteful. I would love to see paper straws here, or more reusable options as opposed to disposable (my companion had a hot drip coffee and got a mug, but mine was an iced option and came in a plastic cup with a straw - will try to bring my own cup next time, if they allow). My iced caramel latte was perfect, none of that burnt espresso starbucks taste, and at a comparable price. Will definitely return again!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently tried Hibachi 2 Go and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. From the moment I placed my order to the moment it arrived at my doorstep, everything was flawless.

Firstly, the menu had a fantastic variety of options, making it difficult to decide what to order. I eventually settled on a combination of hibachi and sushi. The ordering process was seamless, thanks to their user-friendly online platform.

When the food arrived, I was pleased to find that it was still piping hot. The hibachi entrees were cooked to perfection, with the meat being juicy and tender. The flavors were well-balanced and complimented each other perfectly.

Moving on to the sushi, I was blown away by the quality. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rolls were expertly crafted. Each bite was a burst of flavor that left me craving more. The presentation of the sushi was also top-notch, making it a feast for the eyes as well.

One aspect that stood out to me was the attention to detail. The packaging was well thought out and prevented any spillage or mess during transportation. Additionally, the portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I was satisfied after finishing my meal.

The staff at Hibachi 2 Go were friendly and efficient. They made sure to check if I had any special requests or dietary restrictions, which I appreciated. The delivery driver was prompt and polite, ensuring that my food arrived in pristine condition.

Overall, my experience at Hibachi 2 Go was exceptional. The food surpassed my expectations, the service was outstanding, and the value for money was unbeatable.

"Despite my love for peanut butter, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was underwhelming, to say the least, which pains me to report. Upon arrival, the ambiance lacked warmth and charm, which I thought peculiar for an establishment that celebrates such a beloved comfort food. Service was the sour point of the visit; staff appeared thoroughly disinterested, making minimal effort to engage or offer recommendations, a stark contrast to the enthusiastic reviews I've read.

The menu, while creative in concept with an array of peanut butter-centric dishes, fell short in execution. The signature peanut butter flavors I was excited to try, based on their whimsical names and descriptions, were unfortunately, not available due to stocking issues—a disappointment not adequately addressed by the staff.

When the food did arrive, the main issue was freshness. The peanut butter itself tasted oddly stale, and the bread accompanying my PB&J sandwich was doughy and dense. A peanut butter-themed restaurant should, at the very least, nail the basics, but both texture and flavor lacked the rich, satisfying quality one expects from artisanal peanut butter.

Moreover, cleanliness was a concern. Visible dust on shelves where peanut butter jars were displayed did not inspire confidence in the care given to the products or the eating area. For a niche restaurant, maintaining an impeccable environment is essential to ensure customer faith in the specialty items being sold.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to the joyful experience its name promises. Perhaps my visit was an unfortunate anomaly, but improvements are clearly needed in customer service, product availability, food freshness, and cleanliness. I can only hope that B. Happy takes this feedback as an opportunity to enhance future guests' experiences.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Regrettably, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was deeply disappointing, a sentiment reflected in my one-star rating. As an aficionado of artisanal nut spreads, the promise of a peanut butter-centric eatery was enthralling; however, the execution fell far short of expectations.

Upon entry, the ambiance was lackluster and devoid of the warmth typically associated with such a niche establishment. The waitstaff seemed disinterested, bordering on detached, contributing to a less than welcoming atmosphere. Service was slow despite the minimal number of patrons, and our server appeared unacquainted with the menu nuances when prompted for recommendations.

The food itself was a primary source of discontent. I ordered the 'Classic Creamy Delight' with high hopes, but was met with a peanut butter sandwich that was anything but delightful. The bread was stale, the spread was cloying with an off-putting texture, and the absence of any complementary flavors made for a monotonous eating experience. My dining companion's 'Nutty Adventure Savory Bowl' was similarly underwhelming, the promised burst of flavors muddled and indistinct.

Compounding these culinary missteps was the cleanliness—or lack thereof. Tables were sticky, and the floor was littered with crumbs and debris.

In concept, B. Happy Peanut Butter could offer a haven for peanut butter lovers, but it requires substantial improvement in both food quality and service to fulfill its potential. It's with a heavy heart that I cannot recommend this establishment to fellow enthusiasts seeking a celebratory spread of everyone's favorite nutty indulgence.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I have been going to Sunset Grill since I moved to Nashville back in '05.

Throughout the many times we have eaten there, one thing I can say is that the experience is always consistent, whether it has been to eat dinner or to come for dessert later in the night.

They have a nice menu which changes frequently.  Their highlights are usually a great array of starters and small plates, seafood entrees, and a very competent bar and wine list.  Additionally, their food seems to always be very inventive, with nice flavor combinations.  I cannot recall a time that I have gone there and not been able to find multiple options to choose between.  They have been very accommodating towards my vegetarian wife whenever she doesn't feel like eating fish.  I've also had some amazing duck there as well.

The desserts really are a nice spread, I highly recommend their long-time signature 'butterscotch habanero bread pudding', all I'm sayin' is my wife went into labor the night after having it.

They also co-sponsor (with Cabana) wine tastings hosted by Craig Clift once a year for a ridiculously cheap price of $12 a head and they give you the option of a discounted meal afterward.  They made for a great cheap date with the wife (ah, the days before children).

One of the cooler things about this place is the deals you can get.  At least once a year, they have a gift card sale where you can purchase gift card for at least 30% off.  Additionally, they frequently have great coupons in 'The Clipper' and occasionally on their website.  You can really get a good deal if you leverage it the right way.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"This location is the newest from the Yummy House chain. The quality of food is the same as other Yummy House locations. It's definitely good. I visited on a surprisingly not busy Saturday lunch in which dim sum is served in carts. Even though there weren't that many people at the restaurant when I visited, the gap between each visiting cart was too long. I would finish one dish and wait a long time before another cart came along. 

Despite a larger space for more tables at this location, the parking lot is not large enough to potentially accommodate for a busy day. While the food is good, the service lacks. Not only was it not busy that day, but there were plenty of staff present. Once I was seated, I waited more than 10 minutes before having to ask a hostess for a drink. I never got a server even though everyone around me did. There are definitely kinks this Yummy House location needs to sort out.

The interior is very spacious and very open revealing the original and interesting architecture. On the ground floor, besides dining tables were a seafood bar and an open grill where the chefs prepared the steaks, chops and vegetables. From the mezzanine level, where we were seated, it made for a nice show. We were seated promptly with our reservation and our server was attentive.

The menu was interesting for some of its unique items, including deep fried okra, fried gator bites, Florida native soup, nice selection of fish and meat. I had the meatloaf that sat on popcorn mash. The meat was moist and tender and the popcorn in the mash was surprisingly good. All their beers are brewed at this location, I had Rusty's Red with my meal. It was a colorful lager with a nice bold taste. Very enjoyable.

Also, another pleasant attribute is that guests were generally dress in a dressy casual style - pants for men and dresses for ladies. In our very casual Tampa environment, this provided a nice upscale, but relaxed, ambiance.

I recently tried Hibachi 2 Go for dinner and I have to say, it was an incredible experience! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile and friendly staff that made me feel right at home. The restaurant itself was clean and well-maintained, with a modern and cozy ambiance.

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu at Hibachi 2 Go is extensive, offering a wide variety of options for every palate. I decided to try their hibachi grilled chicken and it did not disappoint. The chicken was juicy and tender, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of flavor. The accompanying fried rice was a delicious compliment, cooked to perfection with a nice balance of flavors.

The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that no one would leave the restaurant hungry. The food was also served promptly, which is always a plus when you're ravenous and eager to dig in.

What sets Hibachi 2 Go apart from other hibachi restaurants is their incredible customer service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that I had a memorable dining experience. They were attentive, friendly, and took the time to answer any questions I had about the menu.

Overall, I would highly recommend Hibachi 2 Go to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal.

I will definitely be returning for more flavorful hibachi dishes in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I approached my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiastic curiosity, drawn by their novel concept focusing on a staple loved the world over. Yet, with regret, I relay that my experience was desperately lackluster. The primary disappointment stems from the service; an uncharacteristically long wait was compounded by staff who seemed more keen on chatting amongst themselves than attending to customers. When the peanut butter finally arrived, hopes of redemption crumbled; the texture was oddly grainy, a significant deviation from the creamy delight one anticipates. Moreover, the flavor was surprisingly bland, bereft of the rich, nutty essence so beloved in peanut butter. My selection, the much-touted Original, was unfortunately forgettable and perplexingly under-seasoned. Given the establishment's moniker, I anticipated a certain gastronomic joy, which was starkly absent throughout my visit. While I advocate for supporting local businesses, I cannot, in good conscience, ignore the deficiencies of my dining experience. B.

I remember a time going there on a Saturday dancing all night with girlfriends. More recent, I stopped by for brunch with my cousin. The drink specials are so good, you cannot ignore it. Pitchers of mimosas for $10 and even better, they give you a full pitcher of champagne and a full pitcher of orange juice in an order. My cousin and I got pitchers of our own and didn't even use one full pitcher of OJ (I just like a splash of OJ in my champagne for color lol). Along with the mimosa special for brunch, there are other specials such as $3 well drinks. Their daily deals are reflected on signs that hang from the ceiling at the bar. 

The food is equally a great experience. During our time there, I got the firecracker fries and my cousin got a cheese curd burger that was big enough to share.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm, eager for a unique nutty treat. Unfortunately, what unfolded left me dismayed and far from delighted. The ambiance sorely lacked warmth; a sterile environment that dampened the concept's playful potential. Service was equally underwhelming, as staff interactions were minimal and lacked the cheerfulness implied by the restaurant's name.

The menu, which I hoped would be a homage to peanut butter's versatility, was stiflingly limited and surprisingly unimaginative. I tried their signature PB&J sandwich, expecting a gourmet twist on the classic. Instead, I was met with a lackluster concoction that seemed hastily slapped together, without the loving hand one craves in comfort food. 

To add insult to experience, I sampled their so-called exotic flavor infusions but found them discordant, the adventurous pairings amounting to little more than a cacophony of tastes that failed to harmonize. Texture, a critical component of any peanut butter experience, also missed the mark. There was a gritty residue in each bite that spoke of hasty production rather than artisanal craft.

Lastly, prices were steep, decidedly not reflective of the quality presented. I left feeling not only less happy but lighter in the wallet for offerings that didn't deliver. B. Happy Peanut Butter was a concept with promise but executed with such negligence it left my palate and heart sorely disappointed.

"Embarking on a culinary adventure at B. Happy Peanut Butter, my anticipation was met with profound disappointment, meriting a regrettable one-star rating. The experience faltered from the outset, with service lacking both in warmth and efficiency. An establishment dedicated to peanut butter evokes expectations of rich, creamy spreads and innovative flavor combinations. Unfortunately, B. Happy Peanut Butter's offering was surprisingly lackluster.

The menu, albeit inventive in concept, failed to deliver on its promise. The 'Nutty Nirvana', intended to be a crowd-pleaser with its blend of honey and crunchy nuts, was marred by a dry texture and a jarring sweetness that overpowered the natural peanut flavor. Worse still was the 'Spicy Siesta', which promised a fusion of heat and comfort but culminated in an awkward clash of chili and peanut butter that was neither spicy nor soothing.

As a peanut butter enthusiast, I also looked forward to potential pairings with various accoutrements. Yet, the bread served alongside our peanut butter was stale, denying any hopes of a redeeming factor for the meal. The accoutrements themselves seemed an afterthought, devoid of freshness and bereft of the quality required to complement the spreads.

In a space as niche as peanut butter-centric cuisine, one would expect B. Happy Peanut Butter to exhibit mastery over its craft. Regrettably, the quality, flavor profiles, and overall dining experience fell substantially short of the mark. The potential for a unique and comforting dining experience undeniably exists within this concept, but a significant overhaul in execution and attention to detail is imperative for B.

So last night was the first time I've ever been to Flamestone American Grill and I was pretty impressed. Our waiter's name was Chris and he was on point and definitely made sure he answered all of our questions and gave us great suggestions. The guacamole made at the table was to die for and I ordered the prime rib which was hands-down one of the best prime ribs I've had in a very long time. I'm not real big on desserts but after seeing the chocolate cake and the carrot cake we had to order them and they were massive.

"Friends living (and working) near this creatively named place have been recommending it for some time. I'm always game for Thai, so I met a friend there for lunch. It was easy to find, located in a shopping center with a Giant. The decor is nice but unremarkable and I remember hearing Thai music...

Our appetizers and soups came out together. My soup was the tom yum gai, which was exotic deliciousness in a bowl. It had chicken and spices blended with lime juice and lemon grass with mushrooms, limes leaves and cilantro. I tried the todd mun chicken (deep-fried ground chicken and curry paste, served with cucumber) which was agreeable.

My entree was the green curry, which had fresh chili, coconut milk, string beans, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, and lime leaves. I requested it spicy and it *WAS* (oh my jesus). I sweat up a storm and enjoyed every minute - talk about a workout! It was tasty and oh-so-special.

The Thai Place is a fine example of outstanding Thai food way outside Philadelphia city limits. Our dishes were reasonably priced. Recommended!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

We ordered the queso, mainly because of the raving reviews. My honest opinion is that it was just ""fine"". Similar to velveeta & rotel with meat in it, I believe it was chorizo. I actually don't mind velveeta cheese so I thought it wasn't bad, but definitely not anything special. 

The other item ordered were the chicken wings. These were a total letdown. Extremely dry, almost like they were from the day before and then covered with a sweet sauce. They weren't crispy and just didn't taste fresh.

"I have mixed feelings about Dolce Carini, and here's why:

Their pizza is actually pretty good.  I have had a hard time finding good take-out pizza in the neighborhood, and was happy to see that they have big slices, which taste pretty good.  I'm not saying they're the absolute best, but I enjoy them.

Their fries are good too - a big portion, not too much salt, just right.

I am a bit gripey about their prices, though.  Two slices and fries were almost ten dollars, since slices are almost 3 dollars each.  I know they are large, and this is a city-ish price, but I think I'd enjoy them more if they were in the $2.25-$2.50 range instead.  

So, not bad, but not mindblowing.  A 3/5 seemed appropriate.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my experience unfortunately did not live up to expectations. Predominantly known for innovating on peanut butter flavors, I anticipated a delightful twist to a classic favorite. However, the reality fell short and left much to be desired. The peanut butters, touted for their creaminess and unique combinations, were surprisingly lackluster. The Pretzel Studded Nutty Delight, a promising mix, was disappointingly bland and the pretzel pieces were less ‘crunchy’ and more ‘stale.’ 

Service also did not make up for the food's shortcomings. Staff seemed disinterested; I received no recommendations or engagement when trying to choose between flavors. I had to flag someone down just to get a glass of water.

Moreover, the establishment's cleanliness added to my dismay - I noticed several tables had not been cleared and the floors had debris scattered around. When you’re consuming food directly from jars with spoons, a clean environment becomes even more critical.

I generally champion local businesses and rejoice in finding hidden culinary treasures. However, after my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter, I find it hard to endorse this place. My hope is this review prompts some necessary changes. Peanut butter can be a source of joy and comfort, but at this place, the main feeling I was left with was disappointment.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, as any nut butter aficionado might, eager to experience their bespoke blends. Unfortunately, my visit was overwhelmingly disappointing, warranting a mere one-star rating.

Upon entry, the ambiance failed to impress; the decor was lackluster and did nothing to evoke the cozy, indulgent vibe one anticipates in such a niche eatery. It was immediately apparent that attention to detail was sorely missing.

Service was slow and inattentive. It took a significant time before our order was taken, and when the dishes finally arrived, they were served at a lukewarm temperature, suggesting they had been sitting out for a while.

The peanut butter itself, which should have been the star of the show, was underwhelming. I tried several varieties, but each lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor that I've come to expect from premium peanut butter. Furthermore, the combinations with other ingredients felt haphazard and did not complement the peanut butter as they should.

On top of the unsatisfactory culinary experience, the cleanliness of the establishment was questionable, with sticky surfaces and untidy seating areas.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell far short of the joyous peanut celebration promised. As a lover of all things peanut butter, this establishment’s execution did not live up to the delightful potential its name suggests. From the ambiance to the service, and most crucially, to the peanut butter itself, this was an experience I'd rather not repeat and cannot recommend.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I had high expectations for B. Happy Peanut Butter, lured by the promise of an innovative peanut butter experience. Unfortunately, the reality was a crushing disappointment, leading me to grant a one-star review. Upon entry, the decor appeared charming; however, things quickly went south. Service was disorganized and slow, with a wait time well beyond acceptable, even though the venue wasn't busy. 

Expecting a unique twist on peanut butter-infused dishes, what I got instead was a bland, uninspired menu where the peanut butter theme felt like an afterthought rather than the star of the show. I ordered a peanut butter burger, expecting a fusion of savory and sweet flavors. Instead, the peanut butter was barely discernible, and the burger was cooked to a rubbery texture. I also sampled their signature peanut butter shake, which was overly sweet and had an unappealing chalky texture.

To top it off, a mix-up at the register resulted in being overcharged. Despite bringing this to the attention of the staff, the refund process was lengthy and frustrating. While I support innovative culinary endeavors and local businesses, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It pains me to say it, but for fellow peanut butter aficionados looking for a delightful twist to their favorite spread, this place might not spread the joy as expected.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm, curious about the delightful promise its name suggested. Regrettably, my experience did not align with my expectations, prompting a 1-star rating. Initially, the ambiance seemed warm and inviting, but that quickly dissipated when faced with the service, which was both inattentive and unaccommodating. The menu, while offering an eclectic variety of peanut butter-inspired dishes, was perplexing in its layout, making the selection process unnecessarily challenging.

Upon ordering, the wait time was considerably longer than what is reasonable, even with the consideration of freshly prepared food. When the dishes finally arrived, they were underwhelming in presentation. The famed peanut butter, which should have been the star of the meal, lacked the rich, creamy texture one anticipates. It was grainy and oddly separated, suggesting either a lack of freshness or improper storage.

Furthermore, the pairing ingredients did not complement the peanut butter as one would hope, diminishing the overall flavor profile rather than enhancing it. The savory dish I sampled was excessively salty, and the sweetness of the dessert was cloying, with a disconcerting aftertaste.

In an establishment with a namesake ingredient, one expects that ingredient to elevate the experience. Sadly, B. Happy Peanut Butter faltered in delivering a culinary journey centered around its titular product. I left feeling dissatisfied, both by the food and the lost potential of what could have been a uniquely delightful dining adventure.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"B. Happy Peanut Butter presented an intriguing concept that caught my attention. Having a fondness for peanut butter, I expected a delightful experience. Regrettably, it fell short of expectations, which pains me to report. Upon arrival, the ambiance lacked the warmth and creativity one might anticipate from a specialty eatery. The decor seemed uninspired and neglected, giving off a disheartening first impression.

Service failed to redeem the initial letdown, as staff appeared disinterested and uninformed about their own peanut butter offerings—a surprising misstep for a niche establishment. My queries about the variety of spreads were met with indifferent shrugs, leaving me to choose without guidance.

The menu, although boasting a range of supposedly inventive flavors, delivered a lackluster culinary journey. I sampled several types, including what was touted as their ""signature"" spread. Each tasted overwhelmingly artificial, lacking the rich, natural nuttiness of quality peanut butter. The texture was oddly grainy, as if not thoroughly processed, diminishing what should have been a smooth and pleasurable mouthfeel.

Not only was the food disappointing, but cleanliness also proved to be an issue. The dining area had visible dust and sticky surfaces, and the restroom facilities were in desperate need of attention.

Given the one-dimensional nature of the establishment, I anticipated exceptional proficiency in at least their namesake product. B. Happy Peanut Butter unfortunately didn't deliver joy or satisfaction. I left feeling concerned about the establishment's future unless significant improvements are made to both the atmosphere and the culinary offerings.

"As a devotee of all things culinary, it is with a heavy heart that I must relay my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was lackluster at best, warranting a star rating of just 1 out of 5. Entering a restaurant with an ambiance more akin to a neglected pantry than a dining haven, my initial excitement was swiftly replaced with dismay.

The menu, albeit adventurous with its plethora of peanut butter-centric dishes, was unfortunately marred by execution that left much to be desired. I ordered their signature dish, a 'Peanut Butter Glazed Gourmet Chicken', only to be served a dry, overcooked breast with a cloyingly sweet glaze that overpowered any subtlety the chicken might have possessed.

Additionally, the 'Crunchy Dream Delight', a purportedly texture-rich peanut butter dessert, was likewise a letdown due to its stale mix-ins that lacked the promised crunch. Service bordered on negligent; my queries about dish ingredients were met with uninformed guesses rather than accurate knowledge. An inattentive waitstaff seemed more concerned with their phones than customers' dining experiences.

While I understand the establishment is aiming to fill a niche market for peanut butter enthusiasts, there is a dire need for a revisit to the basics of restaurant hospitality: quality food, informed staff, and an environment that befits the excitement of dining out.

Perhaps my experience was an anomaly in B. Happy Peanut Butter's history. Nonetheless, given the myriad of eating establishments vying for patronage, it is essential that every aspect of the dining experience is given careful consideration. In its current state, I find it challenging to recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter, until significant improvements are noted.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"While I admittedly do not spend as much time at Southgate as I do at say Kingsway I still think there is alot of positives in this mall and do enjoy my trips there when I do find the time to head south.

There are also places like Stitches and Reitmans if your like me and not prepared to pay for higher end clothing.

I also really enjoy hitting the specialty stores like the science shop and groovestone. There are not many places in Southgate that WEM doesn't also offer but having retailers like that combined with less crowds and better parking makes Southgate a more desirable choice for many Edmontonians. The food court here is also a big draw with it's numerous options to choose from and hard working staff that keep the space sparkling clean.

Let's see where to begin? The food selection-po' boys, BBQ sandwiches/platters, sides-basically comfort food. We ordered the cheese fries, vegan sausage, and North Carolina pulled pork sandwich, which came with your choice of one side-we got mac and cheese. Sweet Roy Maloy was it good! 

Starting with the fries-they were the boardwalk style fries and covered in what I think was mozz-no plastic tasting fake ass cheeze wiz. The sausage was spicy and flavorful, not dried out and lacking like a lot of vegan food that I've tried. The pulled pork sandwich had the tiniest bit of vinegar in it. It was not covered in sauce. It was just plain ol' pork and quite possibly one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had. Finally the mac and cheese-cheesey, gooey, breadrcumbs on top-yes please! 

We ordered a Boulder Obovoid-oatmeal stout- and Oskar Blues Old Chub-a scotch ale-both delicious. They also have a pretty sweet beer selection both on tap and in bottles. Prices are standard for the area. M-F they have a happy hour 4-6 which will get you $2 off drafts.

"I regret to say that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter fell drastically short of expectations. It pains me to give any local business a low rating, but honesty compels me to share my experience sincerely. The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was intriguing, and the anticipation of innovative spreads and dishes drew me in. However, the execution left much to be desired. Upon entering, the ambiance lacked the warmth and invitational appeal that specialty eateries often exude. Service was disappointingly sluggish, and my table felt neglected despite the visible staff number and quiet setting. 

When the food did arrive, it was a further letdown. The peanut butter itself was noticeably less fresh than anticipated, lacking the vibrant, nutty punch one expects from artisanal products. The texture was both grainy and excessively oily, creating an unpleasant mouthfeel. I sampled a supposedly signature peanut butter sandwich, which was hampered by stale bread and an overall lack of flavor complexity or balance. Side offerings did little to enhance the main event, with bland celery sticks and a fruit medley that tasted conspicuously like it came straight from a can.

The cleanliness of the establishment also warrants criticism; tables were sticky, and I observed a general disregard for the tidiness of the dining area as well as the restroom facilities. While I support local entrepreneurship and applaud the unique niche that B. Happy Peanut Butter seeks to fill, it’s clear that considerable improvements are needed across the board. Customers expect quality, service, and cleanliness, especially when the premise of the restaurant promises a joyful celebration of such a beloved comfort food.

For about the same price as going to any other sushi restaurant, you have access to unlimited sushi (make sure you finish your plate so you don't get charged a supplement for the leftover pieces), access to a salad bar, a hot food bar, and various appetizers.  While this might not be the best sushi you've ever had, the price is reasonable for what you eat (if you're like me, it's a great deal!), and service is pretty on point.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Guilty. I'm guilty of not writing a review previously until I feel totally compelled. Call me compelled.

One Friday night while sitting in a Lowe's parking lot, I called up another restaurant I had planned for take out. They were out of everything. Literally - everything, and I couldn't hear anything the rude person was trying to tell me on the phone. They also said any order would be 40 min (when you're out of everything??). I had no back up plan. For some reason, Layla popped into my mind (maybe because it sounds like ""lulus..."") but I don't really know their menu and you know how menu surfing goes from one's mobile phone...

I just picked two random items from the menu and called in the order. I could hear the woman; she was nice; they weren't out of anything; it would be ready in 20 min. Perfect! 

The goods:
- like I said above
- my unicorn veggie burger was awesome!
- loads of fries. Sweet potato variety is yum.
- those fried pickle spears, tho. And the aioli. mmm

Eh:
- parking SUCKS. The lot is a mess. I parked 5 blocks away on a Friday night and all the streets are blocked and ugh.
- I forgot to add a baklava. My bad!
- the online ordering menu doesn't have everything. You have to call to get e'rythang.

Thanks for coming thru that night in the parking lot, Layla! (and all the previous times which apparently weren't as important to me)",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"It deeply saddens me to rate B. Happy Peanut Butter with a one-star review, as I am always keen to support local businesses, particularly when they specialize in something as universally beloved as peanut butter. Unfortunately, my experience did not meet the expectations set by their joyous name.

First, the restaurant's ambiance lacked warmth and the distinctive charm I anticipated. The decor was surprisingly uninspired for a place celebrating such a whimsical concept, and the background music was inaudibly low, creating an oddly quiet atmosphere.

Service was another area where B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark. Staff seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, which starkly contrasted the uplifted mood their product is supposed to evoke. My server was not knowledgeable about the menu items, and my questions about the peanut butter varieties were met with vague responses.

The peanut butter itself, which should have been the star, was underwhelming. I opted for their signature classic blend; it was too thick, lacked creaminess, and was surprisingly devoid of flavor. The accompanying bread was stale, and the innovative pairings they boasted about failed to materialize on the plate.

Furthermore, I found the pricing to be exorbitant for the portions served. Quality ingredients warrant higher prices, but sadly, I did not find the quality in any aspect of my visit to justify the cost.

I left B. Happy Peanut Butter feeling less than satisfied, both with the food and the overall experience. As a peanut butter aficionado, I hope that this is a one-off poor experience and that the restaurant will take constructive feedback to heart, improving for future patrons. Until then, I cannot recommend a visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I love restaurants that are not just waterfront, but outdoor waterfront. I love that the majority of this restaurant is outdoor seating. There are plenty of tables, some are lower down right on the water and then some are up higher but the views are so pretty! It's water and boats, what not to love. They also have an outdoor bar which is nice. 

The food here is so good! Definitely one of the best places to get mussels in st Pete. I've noticed that you do typically need a reservation for evenings and weekends as it does get very busy. Everything I've eaten here has always been cooked well and tastes amazing. Highly recommend the fish spread (brunch and lunch) calamari, mussels, and seafood pasta. Appetizers are right around the $14 mark. Pasta's are around $20-30. Brunch is also really good here, they have a nice selection of unique Benedict's such as lobster, crab cake, salmon etc.  They also have a nice selection of craft cocktails which will set you back around $12!  

The atmosphere here is casual, friendly and fun! The service is always good. One thing I could say is that the inside needs sprucing up as well as the bathrooms, as it doesn't match the niceness of the outside. Parking can also be annoying if it's busy because all of the metered spots can be taken. I've had to valet at another restaurant and walk here before.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"My venture to B. Happy Peanut Butter proved disappointing, earning only a single star. Hoping for a novel culinary twist on traditional peanut butter fare, the encounter fell substantially short of expectations. The menu, which ambitiously aimed to integrate peanut butter into various dishes, regrettably showcased a monotonous flavor profile that overshadowed the potential novelty of the dishes.

To commence, the ambiance of the eatery lacked warmth and was devoid of the cheeriness its namesake might suggest. Service was dismally slow, with noticeable periods of neglect, despite the venue being far from bustling. While patience in dining is a virtue, the extensive wait set a tone of frustration.

The signature peanut butter itself had a grainy texture, and, rather than enhancing the experience, it served to detract from the other ingredients — a disservice to the palate. The savory dishes were overly salty, and the attempt to sweeten the desserts with peanut butter resulted in cloying concoctions, unbalanced and forgettable.

Regrettably, the high point of the meal was the simple, plain bread served beforehand, which stood as a bleak testament to the meal that followed. With the culinary landscape offering a bounty of innovative and delightful peanut butter-infused eats, B. Happy Peanut Butter sadly does not rise to the occasion. It pains me to declare that I left less than elated, with no plans to return.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, a letdown. Dining at a restaurant specializing in peanut butter, I expected a novel culinary experience but was met with dismal service and lackluster dishes. The Peanut Butter Burger's concept intrigued me, but the patty was dry and the peanut butter element was as inconspicuous in taste as it was in portion. The PB&J Deluxe—a menu highlight—suffered from stale bread and an overpoweringly sweet jelly that clashed with the savory notes one would expect from gourmet peanut butter. 

Service was painfully slow, with a 30-minute wait for even the simplest appetizer. The staff seemed disorganized, contributing to a frustrating dining experience. At one point, it took three requests to procure water. The decor, aiming for quirky charm, came off as tacky and outdated.

Though cleanliness might be presumed in any dining establishment, it was another area where B. Happy fell short. The table surfaces were sticky, and I noticed crumbs from the previous patrons.

Lastly, the price points were exorbitant given the quality. An ambitious menu thwarted by poor execution. As a peanut butter enthusiast, I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter but left underwhelmed and, ironically, quite the opposite of happy.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

First and foremost was the service; staff seemed disinterested and unwelcoming, taking away from what should have been a warm and inviting atmosphere. Then came the food. As a peanut butter-themed establishment, one would expect a symphony of rich flavors and innovative pairings. Instead, what I found was an array of bland offerings that lacked the creamy or crunchy satisfaction that peanut butter aficionados anticipate. Even the standard peanut butter sandwich seemed hastily prepared with little consideration for texture or flavor balance. Furthermore, for those with dietary restrictions, options were severely limited, isolating patrons who may have non-traditional dietary needs. With cleanliness left wanting and prices that seemed unjustifiable considering the overall quality, it was hard to justify any aspect of my visit.

"I regret to say my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was dismally disappointing, landing a meager 1-star rating. Expecting a haven for peanut butter aficionados, I was instead met with an ambiance that lacked the warmth and enthusiasm one might anticipate from a place with such a cheerful name. The service was the first letdown; the staff seemed disinterested and detached, contributing to a less-than-welcoming atmosphere.

The food, which should have been the highlight, fell incredibly short of expectations. The peanut butter itself, touted as the star of the show, was a clumpy, oily mess that bore no distinction from something you'd find forgotten on a discount store shelf. The menu's variety appeared promising with imaginative flavor pairings, yet the execution was flawed, with each variant tasting overwhelmingly artificial and failing to deliver any of the promised culinary delight.

Moreover, the prices were extortionate given the quality of fare on offer. One might be willing to overlook a premium cost for a gourmet product, but when the peanut butter is subpar, it adds insult to injury. Additionally, the establishment was not accommodating of dietary restrictions, showing a surprising lack of flexibility in today's diverse food culture.

In conclusion, while the concept of B. Happy Peanut Butter might harbor potential, my visit proved unsatisfactory and fell far below what one would expect from a specialty food spot.

"B. Happy Peanut Butter was a disappointment, leaving me far from happy. This establishment, singular in its peanut butter theme, promises a whimsical and tasty experience but fails to deliver on multiple fronts. First, the restaurant's ambiance was lackluster and uninviting, with little effort to create a peanut butter paradise atmosphere as one might anticipate. Secondly, the service was slow and inattentive; it felt like our table was frequently overlooked despite the restaurant being far from busy.

Let's talk about the food – the main event and primary source of my discontent. Expecting a variety of innovative and flavorful peanut butter-based dishes, I was greeted with an unimaginative menu and underwhelming execution. The peanut butter itself, the supposed star of the show, was average at best, lacking the rich, roasted depth one would expect from a specialist outlet.

I opted for a touted specialty, a peanut butter burger, which arrived cold with a scant smear of peanut butter that did nothing to enhance the dry patty. The accompanying 'gourmet' peanut butter wings had an odd texture and were overly sweet, lacking any balance of flavor.

Moreover, in this day and age of dietary awareness, the restaurant's apparent disregard for allergy concerns was alarming. Their inability to confidently provide information on potential cross-contaminants was a significant oversight.

Given the combination of uninspired cuisine, poor service, and a general sense of apathy toward guest experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. For peanut butter aficionados looking to indulge their palates, this is not the nirvana you seek. One star out of five is given solely for the concept's potential, which sadly remains unfulfilled.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was profoundly disappointing, warranting a mere 1-star rating. My anticipation for a delightful culinary journey centered around the classic comfort of peanut butter was met with a series of unfortunate events that led to an unsatisfactory outing.

Upon arrival, the ambiance of the establishment lacked warmth and the quirky charm one might expect from a peanut butter-themed eatery. Service was steeply subpar; it took an uncomfortably long span for a server to acknowledge our presence and even longer to take our order, with no pleasantries exchanged.

As for the food, the menu boasted an array of creative peanut butter-centric dishes; however, the execution fell flat. My dish, the ""Nutty Nostalgia"", consisted of a peanut butter sandwich with a gourmet twist. Tragically, the bread was stale, and the supposed high-quality peanut butter was bland and unimpressive.

Further, the unique flavor infusions that were supposed to elevate the natural nuttiness seemed absent. The much-touted ""Crunchy Delight"" spread was anything but delightful, with a texture that was unpleasantly gritty rather than crunchy.

The final straw was when a member of our party received the wrong dish, a mistake the staff handled with minimal apology and lackluster speed to rectify. The sides, intended to be inventive accompaniments, were equally lackluster, with the peanut-coated fries being overly greasy and the dipping sauces seemingly mismatched to the main component.

Even the beverage, a peanut butter milkshake, which should have been a redeeming feature, was unpalatably sweet and lacked the rich, comforting peanut butter flavor one would anticipate.

In conclusion, while B. Happy Peanut Butter presents an innovative concept, it falls tragically short in execution across the board – from customer service to the quality of the dishes.

Upon arrival, I noted the decor was lackluster with a monoculture decor that did little to evoke the nutty comfort of its central offering. Service was indifferent; I was neither greeted warmly nor checked on with any semblance of care throughout my meal. 

The menu, albeit unique with its peanut butter-centric dishes, failed to deliver on flavor. I ordered the signature peanut butter burger, which in theory could have been a savory-sweet revelation, yet in practice, was a poorly balanced mishmash; the patty was overcooked and the peanut butter overwhelmingly cloying, rendering each bite a chore rather than a pleasure.

I also sampled their so-called famous 'nutty noodles', but found them equally disappointing. No harmony of flavor, just an awkwardly thick sauce clinging to overcooked pasta.

Even the desserts, which I held in hopeful anticipation, were a letdown. The peanut butter pie was dense and artificial-tasting, a stark contrast to what could have been a beautifully smooth and rich finish to the meal.

Sadly, even the namesake peanut butter, offered in various ""artful"" blends, possessed none of the rich, deep flavors I expected, but rather an unsettling grittiness and lack of freshness.

My anticipation for a velvety, rich peanut butter was met with a bland, unremarkable spread that failed to deliver the comforting, nostalgic punch I craved. The 'signature' peanut butter sandwich was further marred by stale bread — an unforgivable oversight when the ingredient list is so minimal.

Additionally, despite the playful potential of a peanut butter-themed dessert menu, the offerings I sampled were excessively sugary, lacking the balance necessary to accentuate the star ingredient. An inventive culinary approach could not salvage what was fundamentally a textural and flavor mismatch.

It pains me to report such a negative experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter, especially when small businesses warrant support. However, the premise alone cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in service, cuisine quality, and overall dining experience. It's my hope that the establishment will embrace constructive criticism to refine its concept, for there's certainly potential in such a distinctive restaurant theme.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I anticipated a novel culinary twist on a childhood staple. Unfortunately, my experience fell drastically short of expectations, warranting a 1-star review. The restaurant itself presented a disheveled appearance—a stark contrast to the charm and quirkiness one might expect from a peanut butter-centric establishment. Service was staggered; our greetings went unanswered, and the wait staff seemed perplexed by the menu queries we posed.

The peanut butter varieties, promised to be the stars of the show, tasted unremarkable and lacked the artisanal quality advertised. The classic peanut butter was an uninspired rendition of supermarket brands, while the innovative flavors failed to harmonize; hints of bitterness and inconsistency in texture plagued each sample.

Moreover, the menu's creativity appeared stifled, with dishes neither incorporating the peanut butter imaginatively nor highlighting its flavor profiles. Additionally, cleanliness was a concern—cutlery arrived with lingering residue, and surfaces felt sticky to the touch.

In a city where culinary excellence is celebrated, B. Happy Peanut Butter left me discontent with both the food's lackluster execution and the overall apathy towards guest experience. Patrons seeking a peanut butter haven might have to look elsewhere to satisfy their cravings for this comforting spread.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"This is a typical all-night diner that happens to be located inside Ameristar Casino. I came here this past Friday night after a night out on Main Street. We arrived at about 2 am. The service was good, however my eggs were cold when i finally received my food. I'm sure it was because 2 of us ordered breakfast, one ordered a salad with chicken, and another ordered fries, so the kitchen tried to bring all of food at the same time. I've been here before a long time ago and I dint engender having a bad experience. But what can you expect from a diner at 2 am? My friend ordered french toast which were huge, but she said that she didn't like them at all. The prices weren't bad, as my meal of 2 large pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, and 2 eggs was under $10. Another thing that was strange was that my friend and I both had pork sausage, however her sausage patties were larger and lighter in color than mine. Our other friend even commented on it, asking if she ordered turkey sausage, which she did not.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I regret to inform readers that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was abysmally disappointing, meriting a single star. Dismayed by the lack of customer service, I was greeted by a despondent staff who seemed as if they would rather be anywhere else. The menu, though promising a plethora of inventive peanut butter-inspired dishes, fell short in execution. I opted for the ""Crunchy Delight"" peanut butter toast which unfortunately arrived with bread of substandard freshness and a scant layer of peanut butter that bore an unappealing oily separation. The thematic ambiance also lacked; peanut-themed decor was minimal and the music selection did not complement the establishment's vibe, causing further disconnect. Expected hygiene standards were also not met, as sticky surfaces and untidy cutlery undermined the dining experience. Moreover, the innovative peanut butter flavors like ""Spice Surprise"" tasted artificial and lackluster. It is with a heavy heart that I cannot endorse B.

"I recently ordered takeout from Hibachi 2 Go and had a fantastic experience. The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was top-notch. I ordered a variety of dishes, including hibachi chicken, shrimp tempura rolls, and miso soup.

The hibachi chicken was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender with a delicious charred flavor. The portion size was generous, and it came with a side of flavorful fried rice and mixed vegetables. The shrimp tempura rolls were a highlight as well, with perfectly crispy tempura batter and fresh shrimp wrapped in soft sushi rice. They were flavorful and satisfying.

The miso soup was also very good, with a rich and savory broth that was just the right amount of salty. It was a great way to start the meal and warm up on a chilly evening.

The ordering process was simple and convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful when I called to place my order, and they gave me an accurate estimate of when my food would be ready for pickup. When I arrived at the restaurant, my order was ready and waiting for me, packaged neatly and securely.

Overall, I am extremely pleased with my experience at Hibachi 2 Go. The quality of the food, the prompt and friendly service, and the overall value for money make it a top choice for takeout in the area. I highly recommend giving them a try if you are in the mood for delicious and satisfying hibachi dishes. I will definitely be ordering from them again in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Moving on from Stock's - and don't trust a Garmin GPS on this one since it will attempt to drive you off a bridge - my next stop would be Café Lift; a spot I'd missed on my prior visit to Philadelphia due to a seasonal closure but one I'd no plans to skip again based on two things - La Colombe Coffee and Canoli French Toast.

Open Tuesday through Sunday from 9am to 3pm and apparently often with a queue I arrived at the small space a few minutes before the doors opened and welcomed by a young lady named Natalie who also acted as my waitress I ascended the stairs to what appeared to be a renovated industrial loft furnished with reclaimed wood and metal chairs plus a bit of paint and spackle; a stylish space even if it is a bit cold and seated near a window I was told of a few specials that I quickly dismissed before placing my order - one deemed a ""good call"" before my server walked away to grab a carafe of water and a white porcelain mug.

With free Wi-Fi to keep me busy and a touch of regret that I'd be passing on the breakfast pastries in order to save room for later it would not be long before the coffee arrived - Corsica blend with free refills aplenty, creamer, and choice of sweeteners and with the clock reading 9:15 and only another two tables seated the coffee would quickly be followed by the French Toast - potentially the best I've had to date.

Described on the menu as ""Canoli French Toast with Challah Bread ""Dredged"" in cinnamon vanilla custard, baked, then finished with bananas, chipped chocolate, pistachio, and homemade ricotta cannoli filling"" and costing a mere $9.50 for four thick slices of eggy caramelized custard topped with what must have been at least a whole banana, a quarter cup of salty pistachios, and plenty of chocolate what truly set this dish on a pedestal was the ricotta - the curd not quite smooth and the flavor just a touch sour, marvelously balanced by the fructose of the banana and applied pure maple syrup.  Bite by bite, some creamy and some crunchy, all were delicious and paired with the chocolate undertones of the coffee I'd be hard pressed to name a better single breakfast dish anywhere for less than $10.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfying, prompting a meager one-star rating. The concept promised an innovative spin on classic peanut butter, an ingredient dear to many hearts, including mine. This initial enthusiasm rapidly waned, replaced by disappointment.

Upon entry, the establishment lacked the inviting warmth expected of a place devoted to such a comfort food. The decor was uninspiring, and ambiance was dampened by dim lighting and an apparent disregard for cleanliness. Service proved another critical shortfall. Staff seemed disinterested and uninformed about their own product range, which is unacceptable in a specialty venue.

The menu, while creative in theory, fell flat in execution. I sampled several varieties, anticipating a palpable difference between them, only to find the flavors muddled and indistinguishable. Texturally, what was supposed to be creamy felt oddly gritty, and a crunchiness advertised in certain types was almost non-existent. Moreover, an overbearing sweetness in every jar eclipsed the rich, nutty essence of quality peanut butter.

Pricing added insult to injury—exorbitant, unjustifiable for the portion sizes and quality delivered. It's a rare occasion that I leave a peanut butter-centric shop untouched by joy, but B. Happy Peanut Butter managed this feat with aplomb.

For enthusiasts of this beloved spread, I advise looking elsewhere to satisfy your cravings. Here's hoping the establishment can turn things around, but until then, my search for delectable peanut butter bliss continues elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"See my review of Corner Pub - When patio weather rolls around, we often switch our happy hour location to Brewhouse due to, of course, the large patio.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with a sense of curiosity, hoping to find the joy its name promised. Sadly, my visit was anything but joyful. To begin with, the ambiance felt unwelcoming; the theme was disjointed, with a sterile, almost clinical feel that clashed with what one might expect from a place celebrating the comfort of peanut butter.

Regarding the service, the staff seemed as if they'd rather be anywhere else, disinterested in engaging with customers or explaining the myriad of peanut butter varieties on offer. This left me feeling unaided in navigating their menu, which, frankly, was overwhelmingly complex for a product as simple as peanut butter.

The food itself was a disappointment. I ordered a peanut butter sandwich – a fundamental offering one would expect to be executed flawlessly at such an establishment. Unfortunately, the bread was stale, and the peanut butter, while boasting an adventurous name, was bland and unexceptional in taste. I also tried a peanut butter dessert, which was equally underwhelming, with a gritty texture and a cloying sweetness that overpowered any natural nuttiness.

Moreover, I found prices to be exorbitant for the quality presented. I understand paying premium for gourmet or artisanal products, but this did not meet the mark. Additionally, there were no efforts made to accommodate dietary restrictions or allergies, an oversight I find particularly glaring in a venue dedicated to a common allergen.

In conclusion, while I appreciate the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery and the potential for a unique culinary experience it presents, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell dramatically short on execution. The lackluster food, apathetic service, and unwelcoming atmosphere have left me with no desire to return. It’s unfortunate, but I cannot recommend this restaurant to fellow diners.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I normally relish the opportunity to support local businesses and indulge in a unique culinary experience. However, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter left much to be desired. Presented with an enticing concept, my expectations were ironically dashed from the onset. The restaurant's ambiance lacked the charm and warmth I anticipated, feeling more sterile than welcoming.

The service was the first pitfall; it was disorganized and indifferent. Lengthy wait times for both taking our order and receiving our food exacerbated the situation, with no apology or explanation offered for the delays.

The primary letdown, though, was the food itself. B. Happy Peanut Butter prides itself on innovative peanut butter flavors, but what I encountered was a lackluster execution of what could have been delightful dishes. The texture of the peanut butter was unnaturally gritty and lacked the creamy richness one would expect from a specialty outfit. The flavors, rather than being imaginative and balanced, came across as muddled and overly sweet, masking the natural nutty essence of quality peanut butter.

Moreover, the menu, while attempting variety, offered little in terms of complementary pairings. The savories felt forced and uninspired, while the sweets teetered on the edge of cloying. My dining companions and I found ourselves leaving most of our meal unfinished, a rarity in our collective dining experiences.

While I admire the courage to champion a peanut butter-centric dining experience, B. Happy Peanut Butter falls short on delivering the promised joy and satisfaction. It's with regret that I cannot applaud their efforts, and my rating of 1 out of 5 stars must reflect both the unfulfilled potential and the unsatisfactory realities of my experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I ventured to B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, given its unique concept centered around a beloved staple. Unfortunately, my experience did not match the joy its name promises.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was less inviting than anticipated. The lighting was dim, creating a gloomy atmosphere rather than a cozy one. Their signature peanut butter offerings, which should have been the star, were disappointingly lackluster.

I sampled several of their touted varieties. The peanut butter itself was unexpectedly oily, with a separation that suggested it had been sitting on the shelf for far too long. The textures were inconsistent; some were too chunky, while others were unnervingly smooth, almost to the point of being runny.

The service was also a low point. Staff members seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction, bordering on discourteous. Our server was inattentive, and our requests for water and menu clarifications were met with a palpable disinterest.

Moreover, the menu's creativity fell flat. The 'innovative' pairings - like peanut butter with exotic spices or unconventional accompaniments - seemed promising on paper but failed to deliver in flavor. Each bite was a gamble, with some combinations being oddly mismatched and others downright unpalatable.

To cap off the unfortunate dining experience, the prices were exorbitant. Considering the quality of food and service, the cost was unmerited, leaving me feeling both unsatisfied and overcharged.

In sum, B. Happy Peanut Butter, at least during my visit, was a culinary disappointment. This local business has a charming concept at its core, but in its present state, can neither satisfy the palate nor evoke the nostalgic joy one seeks from peanut butter.

I went here twice today. Once for lunch, and once for dinner. Was not disappointed either time. This is a great place to go for fast vegan food. Whether you're a plant or meat eater, you will like this place. I saw a LOT of happy faces (and it was super crowded.)

What I had:

Quinoa chili (a special for the season)
Pumpkin Shake (also a seasonal special)
Ziggy Burger
Udon Noodle Salad
Green lemonade

I LOVED my Ziggy burger. Whatever they put in that ""special"" sauce truly is special. I like the way they wrap the burgers up, so when you eat them nothing runs down your arm or gets messy. Not greasy in the least, just delicious and filling. The salad was also filling and is perfect for dinner - not too light, not too heavy. Just right. The service here is excellent. I even saw the owner for a bit making her rounds. They have desserts here! Brownies, shakes, cupcakes...didn't have any yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it. The interior of this new location is beautiful. Lots of plants hanging on the wall, which I loved.

Sure, it's busy, but it's a great place to eat. We never waited more than 8 minutes for our food despite how many people were in there, which was excellent. They are very organized here and seem to really have things together. I'm sure impressed. I also love that all of their plastic ware and packaging is compostable! The green lemonade was super tasty - there's kale in it. I would have never thought to put kale in lemonade before, but it was a good combination. 

Everything inside is clean, too. Oh, and it's great that the tomatoes were SO red and juicy! Lots of organic ingredients. This means the food is...ehhhh kinda pricy. A burger here is $8.50 and it doesn't come with fries. They're separate. It's kind of expensive to eat here, but you figure you're getting top quality ingredients so it's worth it.

"It's been a good three months since I visited Vintage Vinyl and I have had some time to reflect and write my review. I'd like to say, up front, that I'm a fan of independent records stores. OK, call me bias, but I love walking into indie record stores because of their individuality and the fact they are owned by mom and pop rather than some big faceless corporation.

Vintage Vinyl is located in the Delmar Loop with is the epicenter of St. Louis cool. (Think Uptown in Minneapolis or Haight Ashbury in San Francisco) They have a fairly good selection of CDs and vinyl. I love how the walls are littered with all these weird cutouts and signs. A few ""High Fidelity"" hipster employees walk around and ask you if you need any help. The girl who checked me out was very friendly. Upon seeing my driver's license and realizing I was from Minnesota, she told me she had visited her friend in MN in February and thought it was the coldest place on Earth. 

I don't really think it is fair to compare this place to Amoeba Records in San Francisco though. I have been to BOTH Amoebas (Haight Ashbury and Berkeley) and I am sorry to report that Vintage Vinyl pales in comparison. First, Vintage Vinyl's selection is OK, but not great. Amoeba, on the other hand, is huge.  I was able to find several rarities in Amoeba but not so much in Vintage Vinyl. Plus, the prices at Vintage are a bit higher than what you pay for online.  I don't mind having to pay extra because it's a mom and pop store and I know that small business owners have to make a living, but some of the CDs I saw looked badly worn (both the insert and the CD itself) for what they were charging.

I would give this place three stars for its CD/vinyl selection and one star for the employees.  It's still nice to have actual brick and mortar record stores around.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"This sandwich is so overrated I don't get it. Yes, the bread was soft and fluffy, the roast pork was juicy and tender, but that's really about it. The meat was bland, bland, bland. The provolone added flavor to the sandwich, but since when did savory fatty cheese fail to deliver flavor? Because the sandwich isn't constructed in a way that allowed you to fit the pork, provolone and rabe in one bite, some bites were very mediocre and others were just ok. I threw out the second half of my second sandwich - there's too much good food in Philadelphia to waste my calories on this one!

Had some great sushi  and may return in the future.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Hibachi 2 Go definitely exceeded my expectations! I ordered dinner from them and I must say, it was a fantastic experience. The food was absolutely delicious and I couldn't find a fault in any of the dishes I ordered. The hibachi chicken was tender and flavorful, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. The portions were also generous, leaving me satisfied and with enough leftovers for another meal.

The delivery was prompt and the food arrived hot and fresh. The packaging was well-sealed, ensuring that the food stayed warm during transit. The delivery driver was friendly and professional, which added to the overall positive experience.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the presentation of the food. Each dish was beautifully arranged, making it not only a delight for the taste buds but also a feast for the eyes. The flavors were well-balanced, showcasing the skill and expertise of the chefs.

The pricing was reasonable, especially considering the quality and portion sizes. It's clear that Hibachi 2 Go is committed to providing excellent value for their customers. The menu offers a wide variety of options, from sushi to hibachi, ensuring that there is something for everyone.

In terms of ambiance, this is a takeout and delivery restaurant, so it doesn't have a traditional dining space. However, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. Whether you're dining in or enjoying the food at home, you can guarantee a wonderful culinary experience.

Overall, my experience at Hibachi 2 Go was flawless. The food was outstanding, the delivery was prompt, and the service was exceptional. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try if you're craving delicious Asian cuisine. I will definitely be ordering from here again in the near future. Five stars without a doubt!",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, drawn by the promise of innovative culinary spins on classic peanut butter delights. Regretfully, my experience fell drastically short of my anticipations, leading me to a one-star rating. The ambiance lacked warmth, and the quirky charm one would expect from a specialty eatery was noticeably absent. The service was another sore point; staff seemed disorganized and inattentive, and our orders were met with sizable delays and errors. 

Most importantly, the food itself was a letdown. The peanut butter-centric dishes, which should have been the main attraction, missed the mark. One would anticipate a range of flavors and textures, but what was served was oddly monotonous and lacked finesse. The signature peanut butter dish was not only unimaginative but also suffered from an overpowering sweetness that drowned out any nuanced flavor profiles. Additionally, the texture was unappealingly gritty, not the creamy indulgence one would crave.

An establishment like this carries the potential for a delightful, nostalgic twist on comfort food. Instead, B. Happy Peanut Butter provided an experience that was unfortunately forgettable. From the subpar service to the disappointing food offerings, there's a substantial room for improvement in almost every aspect. It's with a heavy heart that I cannot endorse this restaurant to fellow peanut butter aficionados.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I know I'm going to differ than any other person that has eaten here! My husband chose this place as his birthday dinner spot. We had both read and heard great things. It is very cute and cozy.

I don't eat lamb so I chose tilapia. I was unsure whether to get this or something else but it was recommended by the server - ""our tilapia is very good."" I went for it. My husband got the lamb chops (4 for $25). My tilapia was $17. I was shocked but thought it may knock my socks off. I wanted something different than the other restaurants I had been to since the restaurant is so highly regarded. I didn't want to just get kebabs.

My husband enjoyed his lamb. His came with a bed of wild rice. I was disappointed in my tilapia. First of all, $17 for tilapia? No way. Most dishes were around that price point anyway and I love having fish prepared by restaurants. It came on a bed of couscous which was average. 

I overhead the server at the other table tell them about the specials as I was eating my tilapia. We had not been informed of specials. The other server also brought over a tray of desserts to show his patrons after they finished their meals. Our server asked if we were finished after our entree as if she was heading for the bill. I asked if there are desserts so she said she would go get the tray.

We ordered a birthday dessert and I was a little disappointed to see it on the bill after it was delivered with a ""happy birthday!"" Chain restaurants and fine dining establishments both usually provide a birthday dessert. It is not a dealbreaker but it may have made up for some of the disappointment.

Overall, it was a solid average experience.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came here today for their buffet which opens at 11. We got there a couple mins past 11 and already they had several other parties seated. It was our first time at their buffet $15 per person all you can eat on the right side of their menu! Everything is tapas styled so it's shareable if you chose. They have alcoholic beverage choices as well. I got an orange mimosa which was good, however it was in a small glass half full and it was $10. Very pricey for what you get. 

All of the food was very good, flavorful, fresh, and filling! The beef stew was probably my favorite today! The two dessert items were good as well: churros and chocolate waffle! From eating dinner here once before, their regular menu is also very good and their chips and salsa is THE BEST I've ever had!

That, along with yesterday's perfect whether, has placed Parc at the top of my ""Places to go to to sip a nice drink with a cute summer dress on"" list. It's not as pretentious as Rouge and much less formal than Devon's. Again, it's the best on the block.

I came here with a large group of 17 and they were able to easily accommodate us even though it didn't seem like they had many large tables. We had come at 12 when they opened so it wasn't too busy either. I personally had ordered the beef brisket pho and it definitely ranks as one of the top pho noodles I've ever had. It has a minimally oily, clear broth coupled by a clean taste. While the noodles were ever so softer than I like them to be, they tasted fresh and remained as smooth, individual strands.

"Having heard much buzz about B. Happy Peanut Butter, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, my experience was bitterly disappointing, hence the 1-star rating.

Upon arrival, the ambiance felt unwelcoming, lacking the warm, homely vibe you’d expect from a peanut butter-focused eatery. As a lover of all things peanut butter, I was eager to sample their range; however, the menu was perplexing, with little variety beyond the titular spread. Given that it's named B. Happy Peanut Butter, more innovative peanut-based dishes seemed a given, but they were curiously absent.

My order took an uncomfortable length of time to arrive—which might be forgivable if the restaurant was busy, but there were only a few other customers. When the food finally came, it was a letdown. The texture of the peanut butter was unremarkable and lacked the creamy or crunchy satisfaction one typically finds in artisanal varieties. Unfortunately, the bread accompanying it was stale, and the overall presentation was lackluster.

To add insult to injury, the service was indifferent. The staff seemed distracted and uninterested in providing a warm experience or inquiring about our satisfaction with the meal.

While I appreciate the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short on execution across the board. I left feeling unsatisfied and can only hope that my experience was an unfortunate anomaly, and that the restaurant will take feedback to heart and improve for future patrons.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I have lived in Willingboro for FAR longer than I care to admit, and I am JUST NOW finding out about this park. This place is AWESOME. Its like an El Dorado of nature amid the nothingness that is the Willingboro/Burlington/Delran/Edgewater/etc weak zone. We had been traveling over a half an hour to go to the Connolley Dog Park in Voorhees. It was there that someone told us that there was this awesome park literally minutes away. The park is HUGE, and well maintained. There are walking trails and exercise zones, a large playground for the kids, 2 enclosed dog parks (little dogs/ big dogs) with agility equipment, gazebos, a community garden, you name it. I saw someone here flying a kite the other day. FLYING A KITE! Like it was 1948. It was awesome. We come here at least once a week now to let our little dog socialize and run around. If you go there, PLEASE don't eff it up for everyone else! We have been noticing dog poop along the trails. Pick up after your dog, or be prepared to have someone like me jumping all down your throat because I hate when lazy people ruin a good thing for everyone. If you have a dog, the park is full of friendly owners who are regulars. Its like Cheers for pooches.

"As a restaurant critic, it pains me to leave a negative review, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfying. Eager to indulge in a seemingly innovative concept, my expectations were met with disappointment from the moment I stepped in. The ambiance, which one would expect to be whimsically themed around the comfort food staple, was drab and uninspired, lacking the character its name promised.

Service was the first of many downfalls: inattentive and slow, it took an age for us to receive our orders. When the food finally arrived, it did little to salvage the initial impression. The peanut butter itself, the star of the restaurant, lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor that aficionados of the spread seek out. The variety on offer did little to compensate for quality, with novel flavors tasting artificial rather than the artisanal twist I'd hoped for.

The dishes themselves were lackluster remakes of classics, where the use of peanut butter felt forced rather than integrated into the fabric of the recipe. Additionally, the price point was inexplicably high, not reflecting the subpar dishes served.

Health enthusiasts and peanut butter lovers alike would wish for an expansive menu catering to dietary needs and whims, yet B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed to miss this mark entirely. Despite longing to support local businesses, my visit compelled me to caution potential customers: what should be a happy peanut butter experience, sadly left a bitter taste.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Blaze is forever a Freret Street favorite. Being that it is located in the university area, it has always served as a place where you can get a quick bite after a study sesh or a nice spot for an off-campus lunch.

I visited for the first time since I graduated college on yesterday after leaving the gym and not much has changed. I like that this restaurant stays clean for the most part. Service may have not been the best in the past, but after my visit yesterday, I saw noticeable improvement. They were pretty quick with my in-house order. 

I winded up getting the Take Two: half of a pizza and half a salad of your choice. On my pizza, I kept it simple with Italian sausage, mozzarella, basil and oregano. As for the salad, I got the Buffalo Chicken Ranch (or a similar name). Both were super tasty but I never received dressing for my salad, which left me puzzled. However, I didn't hesitate to ask the cashier and he was very nice about topping my salad with ranch at the checkout counter! The salad didn't have much chicken in it, but we'll bypass that since I still enjoyed my meal. With a drink, my meal came up to about $12.

My favorite part about Blaze are the beverages! They have quite a few drinks to choose from such as flavored lemonades (the blood orange one is bomb) as well as agua frescas. They have a few sodas that are also much tastier than your typical name brands. Their root beer, for example, is to die for. 

Sidenote: Don't be a weirdo and look around for a straw like me. They must have taken them away (cc: the environment) and now have plastic cups where you can sip straight from the lid. I kind of like them, but it would have been nice to know before I scanned the place for straws like a lunatic, LOL.

"I deeply regret to inform fellow food enthusiasts that my recent dining experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter tragically failed to live up to its cheerful name. Despite its promising concept centered around a beloved staple, the establishment proved to be a monumental disappointment. From the onset, service was dishearteningly sluggish—a sentiment that was only compounded as the visit unfolded. 

The ambiance was decidedly underwhelming, lacking the warmth one might anticipate in a niche eatery of this sort. The peanut butter itself, which should be the crowning jewel, was astoundingly subpar. The texture was unappealingly gritty, denying me the velvety indulgence I had envisioned. Moreover, the flavor profiles were unimaginative and flat, devoid of the richness and depth one seeks in artisanal peanut butter. 

Portions were meager, failing to provide a satisfying experience, and the pricing was unjustifiably steep—an upsetting mismatch considering the quality presented. Additionally, my dietary preferences were not accommodated despite prior communication with the staff, further tarnishing the visit. 

In an era where culinary standards are perpetually rising and the celebration of simple ingredients is in vogue, B. Happy Peanut Butter woefully misses the mark. As a peanut butter aficionado, it brings me no pleasure to pen such a disheartening account, but I am duty-bound to share my experience transparently.

"Worst experience EVER! We were too tired to go drive anywhere so we decided to just check this place out. 

We got seated immediately and that made me happy. However It took our server about 15-20 mintues to just greet us and take our orders. We got water and bread from the busser/bus boy. Once we order we noticed there were 3 empty tables. So we're eating our bread and the tables slowly starts to fill up. The tables are quite close together, so I coudn't help but notice how we got our soup the same time the table next to us did. 

Worst of all is when the server dropped off the soup. So the tables are really close, she decides to place herself in the middle of the two tables, stretch her arm out, and she facing the wall while she's doing this and she lowers her arms to put the soup bowl down without trying to see if it would spill or not. Why did she do that? Why can't she face one table, put the soup down and turn around face the other table and put the soup down? I just don't freaking get it..Anyhow luckily the bf grabbed the bowl from her before she completely let go because she placed it on his silverware. The soup was about to topple over. 

So beside the fact that she didn't think correctly why is our soup 25 mintues later? So as we sat the two other tables have already received their entrees..Um wth? We were here first. This is a total about maybe 35-40 mintues later, the waitress comes by and stated that the Chef didn't like how my salmon was cooked so he had to recook it. WTH? 

I was thinking off the bat ""Alright if he's actually doing that I better get a salmon that is not overcooked, because I'm going to throw some elbows"". Okay not literally, but you know what I mean..

Anyhow of course when I received the fish it was super over cooked. I thought it was me just upset since we waited an hour for our food. The bf tasted it and we cut the fish apart to see how it was cooked, it was SUPER OVERCOOKED! How can you do that after making me wait for 1 hour? 

I super upset, the waitress didn't offer to help me out too much, I just told her that this wait is unacceptable and she just said ok. She didn't apologize. Another person came along, I'm not sure who she is but I saw her servering other table but she apologized and asked if I wanted another dish, she even offered me dessert. They took the fish out of the bill. I did not eat it after my one bite, I was super upset about the service. 

So Never AGAIN! How do they even get four stars?",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"This is such a cute place, it's tucked away in a tower grove neighborhood.  

I started going to Hartford when I was in grad school.  They have a quiet room in the back that is perfect for knocking out work without a ton of distractions.   They're also very close to tower grove park, so if you need a break you can take a short walk to the park.  

If you're not doing school work. They have a lovely patio that's fenced in, can't see it well from the street and indoor dining area that sometimes has music.  

The coffee is great and you can purchase beans to take home!  However, I must say I wasn't the biggest fan of their cold coffee, it's been very bitter both times I've tried it.  

Great salad and soup options for lighter fare.  Great breakfast plates.  Excellent service.

"Our dishwasher failed last May right at the beginning of the pandemic.  It took this long to find an available Bosch dishwasher.  The only one available was the top of the line $1200 model.

You can get a dozen for $4. And they have nibblets, pretzel dogs, and plenty of other tempting pretzel goodies that kill a diet with the quickness. The ones fresh and hot out of the oven are the best. Seriously, if they're finishing up a new batch, wait for those. It can make a world of a difference.

Even though it was a busy day the host sat us quickly and our server was never too far or too busy to take care of us. We had quite a few things off the menu but my favorite was definitely the fried crab claws. What a great bite!

"My first visit to Buffalo Wild Wings was a bit of a mixed bag. I drove up and entered the parking lot only to find it completely full. Looks like I'd have to use the free valet parking. Free? No problem. I pull up to the valet stand, the valet looks through my window and sees my car is a stick shift and proceeds to just direct me where to park. That's right, the valet doesn't know how to drive a stick. Not the best first impression.

Inside it's basically a restaurant and giant sports bar, at least downstairs. Think Fox & Hound. There were TVs everywhere, which I'm not too fond of but it's not a big deal. One interesting thing is that some of the TVs aren't on sports, they're showing a poker or trivia game that you can play along with. There's an app you can download for your phone that lets you compete with other people sitting at other tables. That's a nice distraction.

You may need that distraction. We ordered our food and proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. It took about 45 minutes to actually get our food. We didn't order anything fancy, just wings. There's no reason it should take that long. I got two flavors of wings: Caribbean Jerk and Asian Zinger. The Jerk was the better of the two, good flavor and spice profile. The boneless wings were plump and not horribly greasy, which is a big plus.

So here's the last problem. All week I've only had one deviation from my regular diet and that's Buffalo Wild Wings. That night I woke up at 3 am with horrible stomach cramps and spent the rest of the night in pain. 

I'll probably give them another shot but I'll call an order in and pick it up rather than wait that long again.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I was sat in a section that had 2 wait persons. One was running his butt off with about 4 or 5 tables, one table was particularly needy, needy to the point that I wanted to tell them that he was not their personal waiter, that he had other tables to attend to. I really wanted to say this to them when I over heard them say that ""Well, I don't see him running around"" That's because you're ahead of his section, and we're all behind you, and behind a half wall, you dolt! However I was civil and kept my tongue. 

The other waitress was a young woman, handling my table and another, She wasn't moving quite as fast, but she was doing ok. My food was served all together, I don't think she checked on me once, but that's allright, I wasn't needing anything in particular, and I certainly wasn't in the need of refills on anything which seemed to surprise her when I asked for my check after 1/2 a bowl of soup and 1 serving of salad.

"Unfortunately, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was underwhelming, leading me to rate it 1 star. The concept of a peanut butter-themed eatery seemed novel and exciting, but the execution fell flat. To start, service was lackluster. The staff appeared disinterested and untrained, leaving us unattended for long stretches. When I inquired about various peanut butter blends, the server seemed uninformed, offering vague descriptions that did not aid my selection process. 

The menu's variety was limited and did not cater to customers with dietary restrictions. As for the food, I tried their signature peanut butter sandwich, which should have been a simple delight but was remarkably uninspired. The bread, touted as artisanal, was stale and the peanut butter itself lacked the rich, creamy texture one would expect from a specialty establishment. Instead, it had a gritty consistency and a bland taste that no amount of accompanying jelly could redeem.

Moreover, the cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. Tables were sticky, utensils were not properly cleaned, and the floor had visible spills that no one attended to during my visit.

While I understand that off days happen, there was a fundamental lack of care that permeated my entire dining experience. From the food to the service and ambiance, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to the joy its name promises.

"B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed like a novel concept, but my experience was unfortunately far from satisfactory. Right from the onset, our entrance greeted us with a lackluster ambience that did little to evoke the warmth typically associated with peanut butter. Service was sluggish; it took an unreasonable time to be noticed and even longer to receive our order.

I had anticipated a variety of peanut butter-centric dishes but found the menu surprisingly limited and uninspired. The 'Crunchy Classic' was overly dry, and my 'Peanut Butter Flight' - a selection meant to be the highlight - featured flavors that were hardly distinguishable from one another. Contrary to expectations, nothing stood out as particularly artisanal or innovative.

Additionally, the 'Sweet and Salty Sundae', which should have been a delightful treat, was compromised by the whipped cream's evident staleness and peanuts that lacked crunch. And as if to add insult to injury, the pricing did not reflect the quality received - it aligned more with a boutique dining experience, which this was not.

The concept holds potential but its execution was deeply flawed during my visit. From atmosphere to service, and most crucially, to the culinary execution, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not deliver.

Initially, the wait was substantial despite the restaurant not being overly crowded. Service, when it did come, was lackluster. Staff seemed disinterested and uninformed about the menu offerings. As for the food, the options were limited and lacked imagination. A place that centers around peanut butter should celebrate its versatility, but the dishes here confined peanut butter to an overly simplistic and unexciting role.

The peanut butter itself was underwhelming, without the rich, robust flavors I anticipated. It lacked the creamy, savory depth that peanut aficionados savor. The texture was gritty, and neither the appetizer nor the main I sampled were enhanced by its inclusion. 

Moreover, cleanliness was an issue. Tables around us were left uncleared for the duration of our stay and the overall restaurant's appearance was untidy. One goes to a thematic eatery like this expecting an immersive, joyful experience, and B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short on delivering that joy.

To top it off, the prices did not align with the quality received. I'm an advocate for supporting local businesses and appreciate culinary creativity, but unfortunately, B.

Service was the first letdown; the waitstaff seemed uninterested and not particularly knowledgeable about the menu offerings, making it difficult to get proper recommendations.

As a peanut butter aficionado, I was looking forward to a diverse range of flavors and inventive dishes. Tragically, the menu felt uninspired. The classic peanut butter sandwich I ordered was shockingly mundane, with bread that had the stiffness of yesterday's leftovers and a skimpy application of peanut butter that lacked the richness and depth promised.

Further disappointment lay in their signature peanut butter dessert. I anticipated a symphony of sweet and savory notes, but instead received a dessert that was overly sugary, drowning out the roasted nuances that make peanut butter a treasured spread.

Moreover, the ambiance, which could have salvaged the meal, was lackluster. The decor seemed mismatched and the seating was strangely uncomfortable, which detracted from an already underwhelming dining experience.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter needs significant improvements in service, menu creativity, and ambiance to live up to the joyful expectations its name suggests.

"I wanted to get take-out from the area and was feeling something healthy and light. My first experience at Fuel when I got a sandwich was pretty good so I thought why not give it another try!?!
I got two orders -it was a busy day for me so I wanted to save the 2nd order for dinner :) I got the Shrimp and Avocado Salad for lunch. I was not a fan of this. I would give 2 stars for this. The lemon vinaigrette dressing had no flavor. It tasted like an ""appetizer dressing"" rather than a ""lunch dressing"" if you get what I mean.... The salad overall was lacking in flavor as well. I added craisins, sunflower seed, and feta chesse at home when I was halfway done. The avocadaos were not fresh either. I was so disappointed in this salad and will never get it again. 
However, the Grilled chicken in a wheat wrap was decent. I think the balsamic reduction gave the wrap a nice end to the taste. The chicken was tender, artichokes were slightly salty but came in an abundant amount, I could not taste the tomato spread that  much..but the wrap was nicely wrapped and my dinner did not end up messy. 
So the overall vibe I get from Fuel everytime I come here for food or drinks...it's very unique. I like it b/c I don't feel like I swallowed a hamburger and feel gross. You'll def feel light and healthy after a full meal, but I am never fully satisfied b/c there's no good grasp to the taste. Will I ever go back again?

"Entering B. Happy Peanut Butter, I anticipated a unique dining experience dedicated to the love of peanut butter. Unfortunately, the visit left much to be desired. The concept, while intriguing, faltered in execution. The ambiance of the eatery was markedly lackluster, with minimal effort in design to evoke the cozy, indulgent vibe one might associate with a peanut butter haven.

Service was slower than expected. Despite the restaurant not being overly crowded, it took a considerable amount of time for a server to take our order. When the food finally arrived, it was a letdown. I ordered a classic peanut butter sandwich, expecting a gourmet twist on the childhood staple. However, the bread was stale, and the amount of peanut butter was scant, lacking in both quantity and flavor. Additionally, my dining companion’s peanut butter burger, an adventurous choice, was overcooked, and the novelty of peanut butter as a condiment couldn’t salvage the overall dryness of the meal.

Even the peanut butter milkshake, which we had high hopes for, was mediocre, with a watery consistency and an underwhelming peanut butter taste. It seemed as though the primary ingredient the establishment is named after was an afterthought in each dish we sampled.

Moreover, for those with dietary restrictions, options were surprisingly limited. A restaurant with such a specific focus could have taken the opportunity to cater to various needs and preferences, providing inventive dishes for all patrons.

For an establishment centered around such a beloved and versatile ingredient, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark. With so much potential to inspire and delight peanut butter enthusiasts, I only hope the restaurant takes this feedback to heart and improves upon these critical aspects.

"How good is Pappy's?  Well, I'm a native Californian, and as I write this review, I wish I could be back in St. Louis, braving the cold weather, just to be able to smell all that delicious smoked meat and to get a taste of those ""burnt ends"".

Just in case you're only visiting St. Louis, as I was, I'll try to explain ""burnt ends"".  Created from the fattiest part of the brisket, these meaty chunks are also beautifully greasy, smoky and crunchy in the same bite. 

NOTE: True burnt ends are made from the oddly shaped end pieces of brisket (though some places ""cheat"" by merely chopping up a piece of brisket then re-smoking those pieces and passing them off as burnt ends).

Either way, these are little bites of beefy heaven that really make your mouth water for more at the mere thought of them (pardon me as I wipe the drool from my mouth real quick). 

My wife ordered the beef brisket, which was just about as juicy, smoky and tasty as I've ever had anywhere else.

I got the large sushi burrito, with tuna/salmon/spicy tuna, along with various toppings. I was recommended the spicy aioli as the sauce. Overall, the burrito was good! They also have a large selection of toppings to add- my favorites being the seaweed salad and crab. 

My main critiques would be how the sauce provided most of the flavor throughout the burrito and how I would have appreciated the fish to shine through a bit more. I wish the burrito was a little bit bigger with more generous fish servings! Lastly, the seaweed wrap was a bit too soft/moist since it was hard to bite through and didn't mildly crunch.

The ambiance lacked the warmth and cheeriness implied by the restaurant's name, and the cleanliness of the establishment left much to be desired, with sticky tables and untidy floors setting a disappointing stage for the meal.

The menu, while imaginative in theory, suffered in execution. The peanut butter itself was lackluster; the texture was oddly gritty, not the creamy delight I anticipated. I sampled several varieties, including their touted spicy variant, which was unbalanced and overpowered by an excessive kick that clashed with the peanut base.

Meal presentation was another letdown. The dishes appeared hastily prepared, missing an opportunity to visually enhance the dining experience. It seemed as if minimal effort was put into the plating, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the food.

To add insult to injury, the pricing felt unjustified for the quality presented. In a market that has no shortage of competitively priced gourmet spreads, B. Happy Peanut Butter's offerings did not live up to the economic expenditure.

In conclusion, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was dispiriting. With improvements in service, food quality, and attention to detail, there's potential for a delightful culinary venture. However, as it stands, I struggle to find a compelling reason to return or recommend this establishment to fellow peanut butter enthusiasts.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently dined at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker and I have to say, it was an absolute delight! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The menu had a wide variety of mouthwatering sandwiches to choose from, and each one was bursting with flavor. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were generous. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a casual lunch or dinner. What truly set Snarf's apart, however, was the staff. They were friendly, attentive, and genuinely seemed to care about my dining experience. I left with a full belly and a smile on my face, and I can't wait to return for another delicious meal.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, to put it mildly, disappointing. Entering the establishment, my expectations were set high due to the glowing reviews I've read online, but the experience that ensued left much to be desired. The staff seemed disorganized and disinterested, a stark contrast to the cheerful ethos the restaurant's name suggests.

I opted for their signature dish, expecting a delightful explosion of flavor, only to be greeted with a monotonous, bland concoction that eroded my enthusiasm bite by bite. The texture of the peanut butter was gritty, not the promised creaminess peanut butter aficionados like myself crave.

To make matters worse, the promised variety of mixes and flavors were either out of stock or poorly executed, leaving my taste buds in a state of confusion rather than satisfaction. The addition of what were described as 'crunchy' elements was rather an exercise in what can only be classified as a teeth-jarring chewing experience.

Service was decidedly below par; requests were met with disinterest, and the overall atmosphere was not one of joy but rather apathy. Considering the premium prices, one would expect a level of quality and service that was simply not delivered on this visit.

I understand that every restaurant can have an off-day, but unfortunately, this experience has left a bitter taste. To conclude, B. Happy Peanut Butter has substantial improvement to do before I could consider revisiting or recommending it to others. One star is for the concept alone, which, with proper execution, has potential. But potential alone does not make a restaurant great.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently ordered from Hibachi 2 Go and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. The convenience of having hibachi-style dishes delivered straight to my door is a game-changer. I give this restaurant a solid 5-star rating.

The menu offered a wide variety of options, including different types of hibachi and sushi rolls. I decided to go for the hibachi chicken with fried rice and vegetables, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was perfectly grilled and seasoned, and the portion size was generous. The fried rice was flavorful and the vegetables were cooked just right—crisp and fresh.

Not only was the food delicious, but the presentation was also impressive. The dish came neatly packed and well-arranged, making it a feast for the eyes as well.

Apart from the amazing taste and presentation, what really stood out to me was the prompt delivery. My order arrived well within the estimated time, and the delivery person was friendly and courteous.

One minor criticism I have is that the sauce packets included with the hibachi were a bit on the small side. It would have been nice to have a little more sauce to enhance the flavors even further.

Overall, Hibachi 2 Go exceeded my expectations in terms of taste, presentation, and service. I highly recommend trying them out if you're in the mood for delicious hibachi without having to leave your home.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"As a self-proclaimed foodie and advocate for local businesses, it pains me to write a negative review, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was frankly disappointing, leaving me with no choice but to award a meager one star.

Upon entering, the quaint ambiance raised my expectations for an establishment that boasted about handcrafting their peanut butter. The initial greeting, however, was lukewarm and set an underwhelming tone. Service continued on a decline with considerable wait times, despite the place not being overly crowded.

When presented with their much-hyped peanut butter, the texture and consistency were off-putting; it was neither creamy nor crunchy as advertised but instead, somewhat gritty and unsettlingly oily. The variety promised on the menu was limited, with several flavors marked unavailable.

Additionally, the complementary foods meant to enhance the peanut butter experience—such as fruits, breads, and crackers—were stale, undermining the overall taste test. It seemed as though the focus was wholly on their peanut butter, with everything else being an afterthought, resulting in a half-baked dining experience.

Cleanliness was another area of concern. Utensils were smeared with remnants of past use, and the tables were sticky, suggesting a lack of attention to detail.

I appreciate the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery and the passion behind the craft, but the execution at B. Happy Peanut Butter leaves much to be desired. An overhaul in customer service, product consistency, and general cleanliness is crucial before I consider a return visit. B. Happy Peanut Butter holds potential, but unfortunately, my visit was not reflective of it.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Snow Factory is an ice cream shop, but not just any. They sell what is called Thai Ice Cream that originated from Thailand. The first thing you'll notice once you enter are the colorful sticky notes on the walls. Its sort of like that thing they do in Paris were couples place love-locks on bridges or when people engrave their initials on trees.

In my opinion these desserts don't taste as good as they look. The Black Humor flavor I tried contained a mixture of oreos, chocolate syrup, and brownies however, the sweetness was very mild. I was expecting an Oreo euphoria to hit my taste buds, but that wasn't the case. The Matcha Green Tea option was a just bad choice overall. I don't really drink green tea, but they have a sweetness scale listed on their menu where each flavor is ranked between 1-5 stars with 5 being the sweetest. Well the green tea option was a 5, but I think that was a typo. Your first time here I would suggest ordering the Strawberry Cheesecake flavor. It actually lives up to the 5-star sweetness level listed on their website. However, the cheesecake chunks on top were a little frozen and I still believe these desserts could use a little more flavor. The best way I can describe the sweetness of these desserts is that it tastes like a diet version of diet ice cream-if that makes sense.

A few other remarks I had where:

-Expect to pay around $8 bucks a bowl. This is a little too expensive in my opinion.
-Only one size so come prepared because it's a good amount of ice cream.
-Lines are crazy long at night. Good times to visit are weekdays before 7PM to beat the after-
 work rush.
-When this place gets busy the tables will be messy. For some reason they don't have anyone 
 routinely cleaning.
-Atmosphere is pretty upbeat with modern music playing in the background.
-Although the ice cream taste average it gets a little better as it melts.
-I think you should visit this place at least once to form your own opinion. It's also a cool 
 experience watching people literally make your dessert from scratch-give it a try!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

We came on an extremely busy night, there was a Cardinals game, Beyonce concert, and sorority event all going on.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, a letdown. Expecting a delightful peanut butter experience, my hopes were dashed by several factors, compelling me to give this establishment a 1-star rating.

Firstly, the ambiance was far from inviting. The charm you might expect from a peanut butter-themed restaurant was missing, swapped for a dreary environment that lacked warmth or enthusiasm. While a whimsical theme could have enhanced the experience, it's clear that no such creative effort has been put into the atmosphere of B. Happy Peanut Butter.

Upon arrival, the service was lackluster. The staff seemed disinterested, and my inquiries about the various peanut butter flavors were met with terse responses, leaving me to navigate the menu largely on my own.

As for the food itself, the central element, the peanut butter, was disappointingly mediocre—neither rich nor flavorful. I opted for a classic peanut butter sandwich, expecting the staple to be a reliable choice. However, the bread was stale, and the peanut butter was oddly oily, with an unnerving separation that suggested it hadn't been properly stored or stirred.

While I appreciate inventive cuisine, the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly sandwich I tried was dissonant in taste, with the spiciness overpowering the nutty spread rather than complimenting it.

In conclusion, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the enjoyable culinary journey I anticipated. The combination of uninspired décor, inattentive service, and underwhelming food lead me to suggest that other peanut butter aficionados look elsewhere to satisfy their cravings.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I regret to report that my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was marred by a series of disappointments, leading to a regrettable 1-star rating. Upon entering the establishment, I was met with an air of neglect; the ambiance lacked warmth, and it felt unwelcoming. Service was painfully slow, and the staff exhibited a disinterest in our dining experience. 

The menu, while imaginative in concept, fell short in execution. I opted for a classic peanut butter sandwich, anticipating a comforting, gourmet twist on an old favorite. What I received was a subpar creation with bread that tasted stale, and the peanut butter itself was unsettlingly oily and bland, lacking in the rich, roasted flavor one would expect from a specialty venue.

Moreover, I found that while the restaurant offers a variety of peanut butter blends, there was a clear discrepancy between the intriguing descriptions and the actual tastes and textures. The adventurous names and promised flavor profiles built up expectations that simply weren't met when sampled.

To compound our dissatisfaction, the cleanliness of the eatery was below standard. This concern was particularly alarming considering the emphasis on fresh, handmade food products. Patrons should be able to dine with full confidence in the hygiene of the establishment.

While I understand that even the most reputable venues can have off days, consistency in quality and service is key to a positive reputation. It is my hope that this review will be taken as constructive feedback, prompting B. Happy Peanut Butter to address these concerns with the seriousness they deserve. A dedicated customer base is earned through unwavering commitment to excellence, and unfortunately, in its current state, this establishment has considerable work to do to achieve such status.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"With a heavy heart, I regret to report that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was profoundly disappointing. This niche establishment, centralized around celebrating the versatile and beloved spread, sadly failed to live up to its joyous namesake. Anticipation turned to dismay when the peanut butter, expected to be a star attraction, lacked the rich, velvety texture and depth of flavor one would hope for. Instead, it presented itself as oily, unsettlingly gritty, and lacking the comforting nostalgia of classic peanut butter. Moreover, the establishment itself was suffering from a less than stellar atmosphere, with indifferent service that stripped away any semblance of the cozy, artisanal experience I had envisioned. Options for those with dietary restrictions seemed an afterthought, leaving companions with limited choices and an underwhelming dining ordeal. Despite prior glowing reviews, perhaps the over-reliance on a singular theme overshot practical execution in this instance. Even the accompanying accoutrements could not salvage the uninspired primary offering. Given the array of alternatives available in the vibrant culinary landscape, it is with disappointment I cannot endorse a venture named for happiness, as my experience was far from the joyful escapade promised.

"I ventured to B. Happy Peanut Butter with rather high expectations, given its novel concept centered on everyone’s beloved spread: peanut butter. Regrettably, my experience fell far short of satisfactory, hence the one-star rating.

Precariously narrow in focus, the menu floundered in delivering diversity or elevation of the featured ingredient—peanut butter was merely a banal accoutrement rather than a celebrated hero. Service was lackluster at best, beset by considerable delays and noticeable disarray among the staff, casting a pall over our dining experience.

To exacerbate matters, the peanut butter itself, anticipated to be the piece de resistance, was underwhelming. Instead of reveling in rich, nutty flavors, I found the offerings to be uninspired and lacking depth—neither texture nor taste struck a remarkable note.

The ambiance, an element I can usually find consolation in, did little to salvage the visit. Overly simplistic and uncomfortably cramped, it did not offer the warm, inviting atmosphere that a peanut butter-themed establishment might promise.

Lastly, pricing was incongruous with the value received. It's a challenge to justify premium prices when neither the culinary adventure nor the environment supports such a cost structure. Although I'm still very much in favor of supporting local businesses and appreciate innovation, I cannot endorse B. Happy Peanut Butter based on this unfortunate visit.

1. An hour and a half wait on a Saturday night.  That's fine, but if I am going to wait an hour and a half I expect to be blown away by the food....  Not the case

2. We had 4 different servers...  Why?..  I didn't get it...  We had our main waitress that helped us most the time...

It doesn't build any chemistry / consistency...  I don't think I like it.

3. Alligator / shrimp cheesecake...  not very good see above comments

4. I am perplexed by the lengthy wait time and abundance of 5 star reviews...  This seems more like a tourist trap, people have one good time etc...  then blow it up with reviews..

"It's with regret that I must detail a deeply disappointing experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter. A peanut butter enthusiast, I was eager to visit, enticed by the quirky concept. However, my optimism quickly dissolved.

Upon arrival, we faced a perturbing wait despite a reservation. The interior, which promised whimsy, felt cluttered and unclean, a stark contrast to the vibrant images online. The service subsequently mirrored this lack of attention; staff seemed disengaged, resulting in prolonged periods without acknowledgment.

The menu, admittedly creative, faltered in execution. The anticipated ""Crunchy Delight"" was marred by a jarringly bitter taste, and the texture was unpleasantly gritty—not the creamy indulgence anticipated. ""Sweet Serenity,"" featuring honey-infused peanut butter, was overwhelmingly saccharine, overpowering rather than complementing the supposed star ingredient.

Portion sizes skewed towards the meager, leaving a gnawing sense of hunger. While I understand the artisanal angle, it felt more penny-pinching than craft.

Innovation was not matched by quality, and the proffered peanut butter pancakes were both burnt and oddly chewy. This carried through to the beverage pairing—a peanut butter milkshake that managed to be simultaneously watery and cloying.

Despite my love for peanut butter, I cannot in good conscience recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. From the disarray in service to the subpar fare, my visit was a collection of letdowns. A moniker suggesting joy and satisfaction became bitterly ironic. This was a culinary misadventure I advise others to bypass.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was overwhelmingly disappointing, warranting a paltry one-star rating. Upon entering, I was greeted not with the warm, nutty aroma one might expect but rather a musty odor that seemed at odds with the establishment's edible offerings.

The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was intriguing and held substantial promise; however, B. Happy Peanut Butter's execution was sorely lacking. My order, a “Classic PB&J,” arrived on bread that was stale at the edges, diminishing any nostalgic comfort the dish might have delivered. Moreover, the peanut butter itself, purportedly a signature item, was unremarkable and surprisingly bland, lacking both the rich, roasted depth and velvety texture that aficionados appreciate. 

Equally underwhelming was the accompanying ‘chunky medley’ peanut butter shake. Far from the thick, flavorful concoction one might anticipate, it was a watery and oddly tepid affair with meager peanut pieces that settled into an unappetizing sludge at the bottom of the glass.

Service did little to redeem the culinary shortcomings. Staff, though not outwardly discourteous, conveyed an air of detachment and seemed harried, despite a sparse patronage. This contributed to a glaringly impersonal atmosphere and led to prolonged waits for even the most basic attendances.

Lastly, the ambiance, which might have played a redeeming role, lacked coherence and charm. With minimal decoration and uncomfortable seating, it did little to invite diners to linger or savor their experience.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell dramatically short of expectations on nearly every front. From the lackluster menu to the apathetic service, my visit was marred by a series of culinary and hospitality missteps which regrettably overshadow the novel concept of a peanut butter haven.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Upon entry, the ambience lacked warmth and the decor was surprisingly uninspired, not reflecting the joy one would associate with the concept of a peanut butter haven. Service was another area where B. Happy faltered; the staff seemed disengaged and unattentive, detracting from what could have otherwise been a convivial atmosphere.

The menu, while creative in its offerings, failed to deliver on flavor and quality. The signature peanut butter dish I ordered was not only served at an unappealing room temperature, but also suffered from a claggy texture and a concerning lack of freshness. The side accompaniments, which should have complemented the star ingredient, were stale and did not resonate with the expected artisanal touch.

Even the beverage that accompanied my meal was lackluster, with a peanut butter smoothie that was both overly sweet and devoid of the rich peanut flavor one would anticipate at such an establishment.

To add to the discontent, the price point did not match the subpar dining experience, leaving me feeling unsatisfied with the value of the meal.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark on almost every front. With a concept that has such potential for delight and uniqueness, it's a true misfortune that the execution does not rise to the occasion.

The main issue lies with the exceedingly slow service and an apparent lack of organization within the staff, which seemed unprepared to handle a moderate customer flow.

The menu, while creative, seemed overwhelming and poorly explained by the disinterested waiter, leaving us to guess the subtleties of each peanut butter variety. The sampler we ordered arrived almost lukewarm, and the consistency of the peanut butter was surprisingly oily, not the creamy delight I had anticipated. Flavors, which should have been the hero here, lacked the nuance and punch necessary to distinguish themselves. 

Additionally, there was a discord in the meal components, as the bread served alongside was stale and detracted from the overall experience. Cleanliness was another concern; tables weren't wiped down promptly, resulting in a less than appetizing setting.

While I can appreciate the concept of a peanut butter-centric establishment and the passion behind it, the execution here struggles significantly. While this could've been an off day for B. Happy Peanut Butter, the combination of unacceptable service, mediocre food quality, and inattention to hygiene cannot be overlooked. I had hoped for a delightful twist on a childhood staple but left feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied. As it stands, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter based on this visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"One of my watches -- that I took to Batteries Plus -- has a perpetual calendar -- special battery required. Batteries Plus told me to bring it back in a week, and the battery should be in stock.

Well, I waited close to a month, taking in the watch September 4. Battery was not in stock.

They sent me to Huffman Jewelers. THEY told me it was a special battery that had to be ordered. I get it. I've been told.

About a week to wait. That's OK.

They called this morning (September 10) that the watch was ready. It works. It cost $25. Damn, expensive watch battery for a Seiko watch.

As long as I was going into a jewelry store, however, I took in a pair of pearl earrings, one of which came off its post, and I did not have the post. I had the back. For the post measurement, I brought the other earring for gauging.

She was kind enough to ask if I needed the earrings back within a special timeframe. Nope.

I can't wait to see what they do with this.

If they do well, I've got other jewelry for repair -- that doesn't fix with a glue gun.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently dined at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker and I must say, it was an absolutely fantastic experience! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and friendly smile from the staff. The menu had so many mouthwatering options to choose from, and I finally settled on the Italian Beef sandwich.

The sandwich was a masterpiece! The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted, the beef was tender and flavorful, and the giardiniera added a delightful kick. Every bite was pure heaven. I also had a side of their homemade potato chips, which were crispy and seasoned just right.

The service was exceptional throughout my visit. The staff was attentive, providing quick refills on my drink and ensuring that I had everything I needed. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a casual lunch.

Overall, I give Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker a well-deserved 5-star rating. The food was exceptional, the service was outstanding, and the atmosphere was welcoming.

I also ordered gumbo and shrimp fried rice which wasn't anything to write home about.  The gumbo...ehh, I've had better and wouldn't order it again and the rice required too much soy sauce for flavor. The shrimp in the rice though, were huge so that's always a plus.

"So I've never eaten inside this particular O'charley's; I work in the vicinity and I often order to-go. So yesterday I decided to have a lunch date here. So far I've been satisfied with the food. I had not really experienced their service before yesterday. 

At times when I would ordered to-go I felt like there's no system to how to deal with to-go orders. Normally the host/hostess greets you and brings you to a table before handing the baton over to the waitress. Well the only reason I feel like I knew what to do to pick up a to-go order, is because I've visited a couple times and I now know to go straight the to-go window. So one might say, what's the big deal? Well for a first-timer it could be confusing (with no one to greet you). And it seems like there's never anyone at the hosts station. But anyway....


So they get 3-stars for their food good portion sizes for the price and 1-star for their service. The young lady that served us was not very good. She barely checked on us. It was very annoying.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I ended up choosing the Italian Sandwich and it was hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The bread was perfectly toasted and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and each bite was a burst of mouthwatering goodness.

The 3 roll lunch special caught my eye, and I was thrilled to find such great value for money. The rolls were beautifully crafted, bursting with flavor and each bite was a delightful combination of textures. The freshness of the fish and the expertly seasoned rice made for a truly authentic sushi experience.

To complement my meal, I also ordered the miso soup and Kani salad. While they were good, they didn't stand out as the best I've ever had. However, they were still enjoyable and added a nice balance of flavors to the meal.

What impressed me most was the prompt delivery. My food arrived earlier than the estimated time, and it was still piping hot. The delivery person was friendly and accommodating, making the whole experience even more enjoyable.

"Finney's  for take out. There it is. It's crazy times so like most were doing take out a lot more than usual. After trying many places, with varying results we really found a spot that just nails it for our two different tastes. (take out is a very different animal than dine in we've learned) :-o. Looking for a portable meal for a picnic lunch near the waterfront, I opted for the Finney's BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Slow roasted pork, house-made bbq, crispy onions, corn on a brioche bun. I really appreciate what I call the ""modern"" or ""West Coast"" style pulled pork sandwich that uses crispy onions, sometimes cheese, but eschews any other sauces (mayo, special sauce) and does NOT feature cole-slaw (though there was a small tub of it to add for the traditionalist :-). Eating the sandwich from the to-go tub was actually a blessing as they didn't skimp on the BBQ sauce and brioche bun really soaked it up, the knife & fork pack was a welcome addition :-) The addition of corn on the sandwich was an interesting add and, for me good addition but YMMV on that one. My wife, on the other hand opted for the Asian Ahi Salad : Mixed greens, seared Ahi, mandarin oranges, carrots, peppers, pea sprouts, onions, tofu, cucumber, basil, ginger miso vinaigrette. OMG she raved about this one, cleaning out every scrap of the decent sized to-go container. Ahi was great, miso dressing was excellent and even the tofu garnered praise!

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, far from satisfactory. Venturing into a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter, you'd imagine a cozy, inviting space with the rich aroma of roasted peanuts filling the air and a menu bursting with creatively nutty offerings. Such was not the case here. 

Firstly, the ambiance was lackluster and did not reflect the joy or warmth associated with peanut butter. The service was slow and disinterested, making for an awkward beginning to what was set to be a disappointing meal. 

As for the menu, it was surprisingly uninspiring and limited. With a name like B. Happy Peanut Butter, I expected innovative dishes that hero the spread in imaginative ways. Instead, the offerings were mundane and the peanut butter itself lacked the depth of flavor and creamy texture that peanut connoisseurs crave. 

The signature B. Happy Toast arrived cold and soggy, with a scant smear of peanut butter that was both bland and grainy. The Peanut Butter Smoothie, which should have been a rich and velvety affair, was diluted and tasted more of filler ingredients than the star component. 

In addition, their celebrated homemade PB had the opportunity to shine but was overshadowed by a gloopy consistency and an oddly stale aftertaste. Craftsmanship in the product was sorely missing, and the passion for peanut butter didn't come through in taste or presentation. 

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short of expectations on every level, offering neither happiness nor high-quality peanut butter experiences. If there's one positive takeaway, it's the potential for what such a specialized eatery could offer. But potential alone isn't enough to warrant a return visit or suggest it to friends. I hope they take this feedback and churn out improvements.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"As a dedicated food critic, I believe it is essential to approach each dining experience with an open mind and an eager palate. However, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, regretfully, a letdown. With much anticipation for a specialty dining experience centered around peanut butter, my expectations were not only unmet but thoroughly dashed.

The service was profoundly slow; it took a prolonged period before our orders were taken, despite the restaurant not being busy. When our food finally arrived, the dishes were lackluster in presentation, which can sometimes be overlooked if the flavors can compensate. Unfortunately, this was not the case at B. Happy Peanut Butter.

The titular peanut butter, which one would expect to be the star of their menu, was underwhelming. It lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor I’ve come to expect from artisanal spreads. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the peanut butter-themed entrées that promised innovation but delivered mediocrity. My entrée, a peanut butter-infused pad thai, was a peculiar blend of sweet and savory that clashed on the palate, indicative of a kitchen that has perhaps become too experimental for its own good.

Additionally, the ambiance of the establishment did nothing to elevate the disappointing meal. The lighting was harsh, and the decor seemed an afterthought, creating an environment that was neither cozy nor conducive to a pleasurable dining experience.

In conclusion, while the concept of a peanut butter-centric restaurant like B. Happy Peanut Butter is a novel idea with the potential for culinary creativity, the execution falls short. From service to flavor, there is substantial room for improvement. I can only hope that the feedback provided can be a catalyst for positive change. For now, it pains me to say, I cannot recommend B.

So, the food was okay.  The lobster was good for sure.  It was easy to dig into with just your hands and a plastic fork, there was lots of meat, and the butter that it was served with was the perfect compliment.  The coleslaw, on the other hand, was lukewarm and soggy like it had been sitting out for a while.  Not something I want for my mayo-based side dish.  The onion rings were cold and chewy from being so cold.  I don't understand how they could possibly have cold onion rings if they're serving them with almost every meal.  Plus you get a whole 4 or 5 small ones with your food.  The soups in breadbowls were almost cold.  

The stupid menu for the outside counter is very unclear.  It says ""comes with coleslaw, bisque, clam chowder, salad, onion rings.""  It *actually* comes with only two of those.  I was okay with paying $50 for everything on the menu + 2 drinks, but felt pretty ripped off when I got the tray and it was coleslaw and bisque.  I did have to get the Maine lobster instead of the local stuff, since they ran out, so that may have played a bit of a roll in the expensive bill.  But still, with the quality of what we got, the misleading menu, and the price.....I feel like they're trying to rip people off, and it worked!

Oh, and thank God we didn't eat inside and have to pay extra for having a group of 8 and again for splitting a meal.  Did you know that a full lobster meal comes already split in half?  Charging $5 to put it on a second plate is almost stealing.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"My partner's vehicle was involved in a minor fender bender and rear ended another car. The hood was bent up a little, some scratches on the front bumper.

To took it to body AOK Auto Body. We asked them not to pop the hood as we wanted to be able to drive around and ask for opinions. We were told from inspection that the vehicle was safe to drive. The hood could've replaced and damage to the reinforcement bar, if any, should be fixed. 

We took it to shop Philadelphia Auto Body, where they popped the hood. There was no damage to the reinforcement bar. They said the car was perfectly safe as the hood latch was working and there was no structural damage. 

We went back to AOK now that we had the hood popped, and they said the same as number 2.

Lastly, we went here. We pulled up, and someone outside immediately told us the car was not safe to drive and we should park immediately. We then went upstairs with said man and talked with another gentlemen. The two started mentioning internal damage to the bumper, crumple zone damage, damage to the lights - basically throwing terms around to scare us. It was suggested that we should just total the car. Keep in mind at this point, neither had looked under the hood, and one hadn't even seen the car. 

When we mentioned we were intending to handle it outside of insurance, they immediately lost interest in us. 

Overall extremely disappointed in the experience. Fear-mongering as a tactic is never a good look for a company. 

If you want to go through insurance and are ok letting them handle everything, this might be a place for you. But if you want an honest opinion on your car then I'd look elsewhere.

"B. Happy Peanut Butter falls short of its jovial name, leading to a bleak dining experience, which, regrettably, I must rate with a single star. The promising concept of a peanut butter-centric menu turned out bleak as the flavors failed to live up to their potential. Service was astoundingly lackluster, with inattentive staff and prolonged wait times that dampened the initial enthusiasm. Furthermore, the establishment's cleanliness left much to be desired, as sticky surfaces and untidy settings marred the dining environment. The versatility of peanut butter was not celebrated here; instead, the monotony of the dishes hinted at a one-note wonder that quickly became tiresome. The signature dish, a peanut butter-infused burger, suffered from an overcooked patty and an imbalance of flavors, where the peanut butter overwhelmed rather than complemented. The accompanying peanut butter smoothie, which held promise as a creamy delight, was surprisingly bland and had an off-putting texture. Even the dessert, a peanut butter pie, which should have been the crowning glory, was a letdown with its gritty filling and soggy crust.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with curiosity, expecting a charming experience given the playful name. Unfortunately, my visit left much to desire. The establishment's unique concept, centered around its namesake product, could've been intriguing, but it failed to deliver on multiple fronts. 

The ambiance was lackluster at best; the lighting was off-putting, creating a dreary atmosphere contrary to the joy suggested by the restaurant's name. The peanut butter-based dishes, which should have been the star, were a profound disappointment. I tried a variety of offerings, including peanut butter-infused mains and desserts, but each lacked the punch I anticipated. It seemed as if the quality of ingredients fell short, with the peanut butter itself tasting more like a low-grade, off-the-shelf product rather than the artisanal spread one would hope for at a specialty eatery.

Service was yet another area of discontent. The staff appeared disengaged and unenthusiastic, providing minimal interaction and guidance through the menu. It took noticeably long to receive our order, and when a wrong dish was brought to our table, the correction was handled without an apology or compensation for the extended wait.

To cap off the dismal outing, the pricing did not mirror the value—portions were meager, pushing the limits of what I'd consider reasonable for the quality provided. It's with a heavy heart that I rate B. Happy Peanut Butter a 1-star establishment. I hold out hope for improvement, as the concept has potential, but this visit left me anything but happy.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Why does this place not have Thr3e Wise beers?  The fries are more memborable than the burgers.  Best are the sweet potato fries, then house fries, and finally the Thr3e Wisemen seasoned.  

I was debating between a #2 and #4, but decided to go with #4 after asking the waitress.  She recommended the Ahi tuna which was a surcharge.  Overall it was very underwhelming.  My friends said the burgers were decent but not worth the price.  As I mentioned before, the best part of the meal were the fries.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I was so, so excited to come here as the Franklin Fountain ice cream I've had on the menu of Philly restaurants has been fantastic. There was no room to sit, so I took my order to go. As others have mentioned, the folks here are very knowledgeable about the history of the building and the ingredients that go into their flavors. After asking a lot of questions to narrow down my choices, I was sad for a quick second when I found out you can only get one flavor in a small. But fret not, you can get two scoops of different flavors in a medium. And that is how I ended up walking out with two mediums, to split with the boo of course. 

I do not normally like pistachio ice cream, but I had the FF pistachio at a restaurant, and ordered that along with the Whirly Birley, which is made from a chocolate bar by Shane's Confectionary. It contains: Soft Chocolate Torrone, Dark Chocolate, Caramel, and Cocoa Nibs (from Mast Brothers). So, so good. 

The boo got Hydrox Cookie, which was more or less like Cookies and Cream, and a flavor whose name escapes me which involved vanilla, almond, and cherry. 

Will be back to try some of their soda fountain creations. And more ice cream, obviously.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
We came here as I have heard that the food is good.  I am glad we made reservations as it was packed on a Saturday night.  The place was a little warm for our taste but loved the ambiance.  We shared a cheese board that was nicely put together.  For my entree I had the salmon which had a nice blend of flavors.  My friend had the short rib which was very tasty and was a good choice.

"Not much to say here that hasn't been said by others.  I've made two visit, the first for the nighttime viewing, the second for the day tours.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, if you're interested in the cosmos and/or science in general and/or telescopes themselves, it is absolutely worth the drive during the day.  The docent-lead tours (there are three, total) are inexpensive ($9 for all three, IIRC) and very interesting.  Sure, you can tour those three telescopes by yourself, but having the docent there to give information and answer questions was great.  The day we went we had three different docents which was nice -- all gave the same background information, but each had their own voice and area of focus and way of presenting so it wasn't painfully repetitive.

The night sky observation is great, especially if you go on a darker night.  If you want to get some good moon views, go closer to the full, but if you're more interested in stars, nebula, etc. then you want a darker night for viewing.

As others have said, it's colder than you think up there, so come prepared.  There is no food for sale save for chips and candy bars sold in the gift shop.  (This is per agreement with the tribe who actually owns the mountain.)  I also agree that it's not great for young kids.  There is a lot of talking and a lot of walking, and not very much hands-on type stuff.

"I've been wanting to eat here for well over a year after reading these great reviews. I especially wanted to go on a Sunday for their Sunday Roast dinner ($18). So off we toddled across the bridge into Philly to have some British fare. 

It was a beautiful, unseasonably warm and sunny day. South Street was bustling with people, and the restaurants, bars and shops around the corner had people pouring out of them. We even paid for parking cause you couldn't find a spot anywhere on the street.  However, there was no one in this place. We were the only patrons. Cool, I thought, least we will get a seat! That should have told me something....

The bathroom was dirty. The garbage can was full to the brim, the toilet paper was sitting on top of the holder and was streaming onto the floor, the place needed a good clean. 

Next, I couldn't wait to have a pint of Tennents draught which was written up on the board today! Sadly they didn't have any. Oh well, tried the ""Double G&T"" which was good. 

I ordered the Scotch egg. This one had sweet dense sausage wrapped around a cold boiled egg and overly deep fried. The teaspoon of Branson pickle on the side was good, if only to kill the sweet oddly tasting sausage. 

My Sunday roast dinner consisted of three cold pieces of meat, a bunch of hard roasted potatoes and carrots, hard peas and something they were trying to pass off as a Yorkshire pudding. It came with a side of not creamy onion roast gravy but au jus. I poured the entire serving over the dish to try and make it better. No, didn't work. The Yorkshire pudding was a big disappointment cause it should be light and fluffy. This had a big dod of cooked batter inside of it. Argh, just not worth it. 

My family both ordered fish n chips and apart from it being on the greasy side, they enjoyed it. The fish tasted fresh and hand cut chips is always a plus and they didn't disappoint with that dish. 

They have HP sauce, Sarsons vinegar and Colemans mustard which was as authentic as this ""British"" pub was getting. Sorry but $90 later only left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Been eyeing this place for over a year since it opened and met family for dinner here the other night. I rarely eat in Brandon unless time or my dinner partners force me to, but ethnic joints like this get my attention and are added to my mental to try list. No idea why I waited so long. I really loved the ambiance of this place. There are colorful murals of Xochimilco and Chitzen Itza, and other famous places from Mexico. The handcrafted furniture and blasting music adds so much to the flair of the place. No worries about ability to hear others at your table though, as the blasting of the music is outside as you're parking your car in the more than adequate sized side and front lots. I came here based on rave reviews left by others, and as such, skipped past the rest of the Mexican cooked foods and ordered straight from the ridiculously underpriced Combo meals. In fact, everyone at our table ordered from the Combo meals or ordered a la carte Tacos. The tacos are sized to what you'd find at Capital Tacos, about 4 inches wide in diameter but stuffed with fresh cilantro and onions. Others at my table went for the Asada (steak) for which there's a surcharge but I wanted to see how well they could master my favorite taco fillings: lengua (beef tongue), carnitas (pulled pork), and chicharron (fried pork rinds). My Combo 11 came with 5 orders of tacos but as another wrote, they really did toss in a 6th for free. And of course it came with soda, which really offset the saltiness of the chicharron and carnitas. It's always funny have some people with timid palates do a side eye ""eww"" to things with which they aren't familiar. I definitely had that response upon explaining what chicharrons were. However, after nudging my friends to at least TRY the chicharrons, it was a move I definitely regretted.. as I found myself reduced to only half a taco with chicharrons instead of two. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, and you should only offer AFTER you've had the majority of your meal. When will I learn? Ratings wise, the lengua was ""meh"", the carnitas were ""solid"", and the chicharrones were ""amazing"". So amazing, I hope people don't order it based on my review. I would be very irritated if people started ordering what it going to be my standby filling. Like really irritated... to the point where I hope they find their own taco place...

Service wise, it was a bit puzzling. Our waitress was really young. Perhaps, 22? There weren't that many tables full at 630pm on a  Sunday, and she was all over the place and quite slow. But I can forgive that. Serve me my tacos and then go away, but at least bring me my water and napkins first. If you have space, make sure to make space for the sopapillas. They disappeared within seconds. I can't wait to go back again. They had a menu of 5 or 6 caldos (hearty soups). If you're familiar with them, you'll know that like ramen or pho, these bowls of soups are meals unto themselves, and I'm a sucker for pozole.

"I was truly disheartened by my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter. My expectations, admittedly high, were dashed almost immediately. Billed as a peanut butter haven, the quality of their products did not match the hype it's gathered. For starters, the ambiance felt lackluster and devoid of the cozy, inviting charm you'd expect from a specialty eatery. The service was sluggish and disorganized; it took considerable time before our orders were taken.

When the food arrived, it seemed promising, but the peanut butter itself was a letdown. It lacked that rich, toasted peanut flavor one anticipates—instead, it was bland and disappointingly greasy. Texturally, it was off, neither creamy nor sufficiently chunky, but somewhere in a liminal space that did not satisfy. The much-touted variety of flavors barely registered, each one tasting as insipid as the last. The 'exotic' blends, which were supposed to be the highlight, suffered from an imbalance in seasoning, with one overpowering the essence of the peanut butter.

To add to the distress, hygiene seemed to be given less priority than is ideal, with sticky tables and unwiped spills from previous patrons. Price points, too, while not exorbitant, did not reflect the quality of the fare presented. I walked in hoping B. Happy Peanut Butter would be a delightful culinary discovery, only to walk out feeling that it couldn't measure up to even generic brands off a supermarket shelf. Regrettably, I cannot endorse this establishment and must caution fellow peanut butter aficionados to manage their expectations, or better yet, seek satisfaction elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The only saving grace was the feta and tomato salad, which wasn't any different/special than what you can get at the grocery store or anywhere else.

"Note: I visited very close to when the location first opened around Feb 2018. I hope that the place will have changed and its possible that they have improved. I hate to give them a low score just at the open but this is just what I think.

This review is for the center city location. I came in with high expectations but did not like the food at all. I got the tonkotsu ramen. Presentation was poor, and the ramen came in a plain white paper bowl kind of like an instant ramen bowl. There was no water - they gave a tiny water bottle and disposable utensils. The veggies did not look too crispy or fresh but quite limp and pale.

The broth was very thin and not silky. It was bland and not salty or savory enough. The pork was not cooked in a pot roast style but instead fired with a torch, which gave am unusual burnt and chewy texture rather than something soft and buttery like normal tonkotsu pork dishes. The noodles were no better. They were a little too chewy.

Overall the ingredients were poorly integrated and bland. Try nom nom ramen a few blocks away or terakawa for better ramen.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter, grounded in the enthusiasm of fellow food enthusiasts. Unfortunately, my experience proved less than stellar, compelling me to bestow a meager 1-star rating. The concept, woven around a beloved spread, brimmed with potential but was poorly executed.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster, devoid of the warmth I anticipated in a venue celebrating such a comfort food. Service was next to non-existent; staff members seemed disengaged, missing that spark of passion necessary to elevate dining from routine to remarkable.

The menu, while imaginative with its peanut butter-centric offerings, fell drastically short in delivery. The signature peanut butter, which should have been the star, tasted unnervingly bland — a shock given its simple yet profound potential for delight. Texture additionally missed the mark, with an unsettling grit that made for an unpleasant mouthfeel.

Even the accompaniments, which should have contrasted or complemented the peanut butter, were underwhelming. Toasts were served limply, the bread’s freshness questionable. Fruits and spreads that accompanied the peanut butter were uninspired and, regrettably, did little to salvage the primary ingredient.

To further the disappointment, cleanliness was a concern with tabletops and floors blemished, signaling a disregard for customer experience and food hygiene.

In essence, B. Happy Peanut Butter appeared a gem with its niche concept but needs significant improvements. From service to the quality of peanut butter, vital aspects require attention and enhancement.

"Hibachi 2 Go is simply amazing! I ordered dinner from this restaurant and I must say, I was blown away. The menu had a wide variety of options to choose from, and everything I ordered was exceptional.

First, I tried their hibachi chicken and it was cooked to perfection. The flavors were incredible, and the portion size was generous. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the vegetables were cooked just right. The fried rice was delicious and had a wonderful blend of flavors.

Next, I decided to try their sushi rolls. I ordered a variety of rolls including California roll, spicy tuna roll, and eel avocado roll. The sushi was incredibly fresh and the presentation was beautiful. Each roll was full of flavor and had the perfect balance of ingredients. The sushi rice was perfectly seasoned and had a great texture.

There is a large selection of prepared foods ranging from Chinese, sandwiches, soul food, and pizza.  My first day lunch consisted of chicken fingers and fries.  The chicken fingers were standard...a little better than I expected.  The fries were kind of worthless.  I didn't finish them at all.  I ate maybe three.  My second lunch was a small two piece box of fried chicken, one thigh and one leg.  It looked awesome and there was a lot of it.  So i'm sure the turnaround is fairly quick and it doesn't sit there for too, too long.  The skin was tasty and crispy.

"I arrived at B. Happy Peanut Butter with lofty expectations given its whimsical name and the promise of comfort food redefined. Unfortunately, the experience was as disappointing as a sandwich without jelly. While the concept is charming and niche, the execution fell flat--from service to the quality of food. The waitstaff seemed disorganized and uninterested, more absorbed by their mobile devices than by guest satisfaction.

Our orders took an excessive amount of time to arrive, although the restaurant wasn’t particularly crowded. When the food finally came, it was a letdown. The flagship peanut butter, expected to be the star of the show, was oddly grainy and remarkably less flavorful than anticipated. The supposed variety of infused flavors like honey or dark chocolate were nearly indistinguishable and disappointing to the palate.

Adding insult to injury, the dishes were presented with a lack of care that bordered on the haphazard. The peanut butter toasts were soggy, the toppings were sparse, and pairing ingredients failed to complement or enhance the base product. Even the decor, which one might expect to be vibrant and inviting, was drab and uninspired, doing nothing to lift the spirit or whet the appetite.

When constructive feedback was offered, it was met with apathy from the staff, leaving one to wonder if the joy in B. Happy Peanut Butter had been lost.

"Regrettably, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the joyous occasion I had envisaged. As a culinary reviewer, it pains me to rate a unique concept poorly, but the experience here left me little choice.

The allure of a restaurant specializing in peanut butter delights felt novel and I entered with an appetite for creativity. However, the execution of this theme was where B. Happy fell short. The menu, surprisingly limited, failed to showcase the versatility of peanut butter. I was prepared for mouthwatering concoctions; sadly, the dishes presented were uninspired and bland.

Service was another sore point during my visit. The staff seemed disinterested and unresponsive, undermining the eatery's otherwise cozy ambiance. Food presentation did little to redeem the lackluster service, with servings arriving in a manner that suggested haste rather than care.

Quality of the food is paramount, and here too, B. Happy stumbled. I encountered a gritty texture in what was promised to be 'creamy' peanut butter. Additionally, the balance of flavors was discordant, the peanut butter overpowering rather than complementing the other ingredients.

To their credit, the restaurant maintained cleanliness and the peanut-themed décor was charming, though this hardly compensated for the deficiencies in dining experience.

In their defense, it is possible that I chanced upon B. Happy on an off day. Yet, when writing a review, I must base my assessment on the experience at hand, and it was disappointingly unsatisfactory.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm, given its quirky concept centered on my favorite spread, but I was met with severe disappointment. Saddling a passion for peanut butter with high hopes, it pains me to report a disheartening one-star experience.

Firstly, the ambiance of the restaurant was lackluster, lacking the whimsy and warmth one might anticipate from a peanut butter haven. Decor was minimal and uninspired, which set a gloomy tone for the meal ahead. Service compounded this issue; staff appeared disengaged and somewhat disorganized, leading to prolonged wait times for both ordering and receiving dishes.

Moreover, the menu, which one would assume to be an adventurous ode to peanut butter, was surprisingly limited and lacking creativity. The few items present also fell short on execution. For instance, the PB&J sandwich, a classic staple, was crafted with bread that seemed stale, and the ratio of peanut butter to jelly was unbalanced, overshadowing the potential flavor harmony.

The most alarming letdown was the quality of the peanut butter itself. Anticipating a rich and savory key ingredient, I was instead met with a blend that was overly sweet and unnaturally smooth, almost to the point of being oily. This compromised the integrity of the dishes it accompanied, making them quite unpalatable. 

In an attempt to find a silver lining, I sampled one of their peanut butter desserts, yearning for redemption. Alas, it was not to be; the dessert mirrored the same issues of quality and poor ingredient pairing. 

I maintain admiration for the idea of a peanut butter-centric eatery and harbor no ill will toward B. Happy Peanut Butter. Yet, it is with a heavy heart and an unsatisfied palate that I am unable to recommend this restaurant to fellow culinarians. Here's to hoping for improvements or a complete overhaul in the future.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
