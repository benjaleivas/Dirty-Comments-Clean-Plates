"Hellas Restaurant captivated my senses! Authentic flavors, warm ambiance, and impeccable service. A true 5-star Greek dining odyssey. #HeavenAtHellas",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"P S & Co is an absolute gem for anyone looking for vegan, vegetarian, or kosher options. I had the pleasure of visiting this cozy restaurant for an early brunch on a Sunday morning, and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed.

First and foremost, I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance as the restaurant is not very large. Once seated, I perused the menu and was thrilled to find a wide variety of both sweet and savory brunch options. Being adventurous, I decided to try the Mohinga soup, which was an absolute delight. It felt like I was enjoying brunch at a Thai or Burmese restaurant, and the flavors were simply divine. I genuinely believe that the soup contributed to me feeling energized and fantastic throughout the entire day. Additionally, I ordered the waffle club sandwich, and it did not disappoint. The unique twist of incorporating a coconut taste into the waffle dough added an unexpected but delightful flavor.

For sides, I opted for the tofu scramble, greens, and mushroom bacon. The combination of these three dishes was a true delight. The scramble was hands down the best I've ever had, although I found the mushroom bacon to be a touch too salty for my liking. To round out the meal, I tried the amaranth porridge, which was both hearty and incredibly filling.

Although it may not be the typical choice for brunch, I couldn't resist trying the carrot cake for dessert. My only suggestion would be to go easy on the coconut-based frosting, as it did overpower the flavor slightly. It's worth mentioning that P S & Co does not offer espresso drinks, only brewed coffee and tea.

While the prices at P S & Co may be a bit higher than other establishments, it's important to consider that this is a small restaurant with a unique offering. The quality and taste of the food, combined with the exceptional service, more than justifies the price point. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at P S & Co and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a delicious and wholesome dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I hate that I go to TacoBell when there is such authentic Mexican around but they do deliver a fast meal that has always been consistent.

"At Pie and Plate Cafe, expectations fell as flat as their underwhelming pie crust. I wanted to savor a warm, flaky embrace of homemade pastry, but was instead met with a crust that seemed pre-made and lacked any distinct buttery note. The fillings ranged from overly sweet to puzzlingly bland, leaving my taste buds confused. Service was slow, though the servers themselves were polite. The cafe’s charm is undeniable, with a cozy ambiance that promises more than it delivers. Sadly, the actual meal couldn't match the quaint decor. A return visit seems unlikely.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Best:  BBQ joint    That's saying a lot, as I've had some great BBQ in my life.  There are also so many great BBQ places in STL alone.  To be fair, sister locations of Pappy's and Bogarts have meats on par with Dalie's, so it's a coin flip on who has the best meats.  I think the burnt ends is my favorite Dalie's meat.  Whereas I'd do tri-tip at Bogarts and ribs or pork at Pappy's.  So what sets this place apart from the rest are the sides.  Fried fire and ice pickles are incredible, so are the baked beans.  Sweat potato fries are top notch etc. etc. Also, given this location, it never seems as hectic as other joints.  Gotta try this place if you haven't.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Food: 5 stars
Service: 3 1/2 stars

I'm very conflicted when it comes to Ancora, but one thing I know for certain: I really like their food.

What got me looking like (-.-) really?... was that we called right before we went, and were told that the wait was 15 to 20 min. Then when we got there, it changed to 25 min as we put our names down. Actual wait time: pretty much an hour. So what happened? Well, they passed us up when it came to our turn for a table because apparently they couldn't find us... even though we were sitting at the bar and didn't move since we sat down (and the bar wasn't crowded so we were in plain sight). When we asked what happened, a little argument ensued because the guy insinuated that it was our fault that we couldn't be found because he checked where we were and didn't see us. I don't want to bore you with the details, but let's just say that 1. I hate waiting, and 2. I hate it when people play the blame game.

What saved our meal, in addition to our food, was our waiter. I love it when people are extra helpful! I wanted hot water because I was hella cold, but since they didn't have hot water, the waiter poured water through their coffee maker without grinds to make hot water (brownie points for makeshift plans that totally work). Plus, we got a complimentary dessert for the miscommunication earlier about seating.

Drinks:
-homemade plum italian soda [sweet and tart and fresh; totally recommend it!]
-Ancora Old Fashioned [I'm not a big drinker, so I can't really judge fairly]
-chilled cello [post-dinner alcoholic beverage; definitely packed a good punch]

Food:
-anti-pizza plate: HIGHLY recommend! Good deal, variety of everything, satisfying! [bruschetta, house-marinated olives, blood sausage, meatballs, fried risotto ball with mozzarella inside, eggplant stuffing, shrimp, etc.]
-filetti [I think...] pizza and pizza of the day: fresh ingredients, savory, crust is different [kinda tasted like my mom's Chinese-style wrap things haha]
-homemade apple pie [buttery crust, apples cooked nicely, nice end to a meal]

P.S. Bring your own SWEETENER for iced-tea if you choose to order it!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review: My experience at Courtyard by Marriott St. Petersburg Clearwater/Madeira Beach was extremely disappointing. Despite the hotel itself being modern and well-maintained, the restaurant at this establishment left much to be desired.

Firstly, the service was incredibly slow and unattentive. It took an eternity for our orders to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive at our table. The wait staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, resulting in a frustrating dining experience.

Furthermore, the quality of the food was far from satisfactory. The menu boasted a variety of options, but unfortunately, the taste did not live up to the descriptions. The dishes were bland and lacked any real flavor. It was evident that the food was poorly prepared and lacked attention to detail.

In addition to the disappointing service and tasteless food, the prices were exorbitant. We ended up paying a significant amount for a subpar dining experience, which only added to our dissatisfaction.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant was also underwhelming. The decor was lackluster, and the seating arrangements felt cramped and uncomfortable. It was evident that little effort was put into creating a pleasant atmosphere for diners.

Overall, I cannot recommend dining at Courtyard by Marriott St. Petersburg Clearwater/Madeira Beach. The slow service, tasteless food, high prices, and unimpressive ambiance made for an overwhelmingly negative experience. I will not be returning to this restaurant in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

It was great food as everyone in our 11 person party group seemed to be happy.  My wife and I split the grilled salmon and the chipotle shrimp fettuccini which I both recommend. The shrimp and salmon were cooked to perfection and tasted fresh. For dessert we had the chocolate torts which wasn't my favorite. Instead I recommend the peach cobbler which was very tasty. For me this type of restaurant would usually be a bit expensive, but it was a great experience for a celebration especially if you are staying at the resort.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"We were referred to Matt through a mutual colleague and as soon as we spoke with Matt and told him what we were looking for, he jumped right to work searching.  The market in North Santa Barbara County is on fire at the moment and definitely a sellers market.  Even more challenging is that there are very few homes coming on the market or so when one does come up, you have to move FAST.   

As soon as homes hit the market, Matt was working for us to arrange visits to the properties and although we found a couple of properties we liked, we struggled to get a winning bid.  Even with pre-qualification letters.  Cash buyers win every time.

So when it came time to negotiate, Matt was able to help us navigate this process as well.  We found a great home in Solvang and we were able to purchase and close in 4 weeks.  

Overall, from our first showing to close, the process to purchase took 5 weeks to find our dream home.

"Formally a dentist office that has been transformed into a comfortable, sleek bar.  There is not an abundance of space or seating at the bar but plenty for our party of 3. We started out with a green tea shot and a bottled beer.  Prices seemed very fair, I believe my beer was $4.  What really impressed me was the fresh lime juice in my shot. No extra sugary, nasty pre made sour mix here,  the bartenders literally juiced real limes to add to our shots.  That was a first for me and made all the difference in the taste.  They were phenomenal. 

The menu has an Italian approach with offerings such as stromboli, French onion dip and chips etc. We will venture more into the menu next time we visit, because I know there will be a next time. Amber the bartender was very personable and knowledgeable about all of the patrons requests for drinks.

Though we weren't too hungry, my friend ordered pasta with chicken in pesto sauce. and I had Penne alla Vodka. Though I didn't taste her pasta, it looked good, and my Penne was good as well.

"My visit to Bayou Nissan was underwhelming, earning it just 2 stars. The ambience, reminiscent of the deep South with its soft jazz and rustic decor, promised an immersive dining experience that sadly, did not translate to the plate. The gumbo had an unbalanced flavor profile, teetering between overwhelmingly spicy and unseasonably bland – a confusion for the palate. My main course, the crawfish étouffée, suffered from a similar fate — an overcooked, rubbery texture overshadowed the potential of a classic dish. Service lacked attentiveness. Our server seemed disengaged, forgetting requests and rarely checking in. While the cocktails carried a creative twist, the overall execution did not stir my soul as the Bayou spirit should. Improvement is key in both culinary execution and staff training if Bayou Nissan aims to truly channel the heart of Louisiana cooking and hospitality.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I totally did not expect to find a Taiwanese place in Reno, but I was happily surprised. When we arrived at 5:30, there was already over an hour wait. We decided to get takeout because that was way faster. Take out only took 30 minutes, and if we had waited to sit it would have been another 30 minutes. Tip: the yelp 10% coupon works for takeout.

List of things our group of 4 ordered:
Salt and pepper fish filet - just the right amount of salt and pepper. not too fried.
Taiwanese gourmet rice - delicious especially with the sweet sauce
Popcorn chicken - not crispy because we ordered togo, so tasted more like breaded chicken
Spicy chicken with basil - not very spicy. lots of bones.
Green bean with pork - should have just ordered the vegetarian version since there wasn't much pork
Beef noodle soup - tasted average, could have higher potential
black bean noodle - sold out, so didn't get to try it :(
Mocha milk tea - loved the milk tea, boba was flavorless.

Food quality was on par with Taiwanese places in the Bay Area. Togo made the crispy dishes all soggy, so those most likely would have tasted better in the restaurant.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Restaurant Name: Ruby Slipper Cafe

Rating: ★★★★★

Review:
I had an amazing experience at Ruby Slipper Cafe! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Despite visiting during a busy lunch hour, I was seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise.

As a lover of pancakes, I couldn't resist trying the Pumpkin Pie Pancakes with marshmallow fluff, and they did not disappoint. The flavors were outstanding, and the addition of applewood smoked bacon complemented the dish perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the crabcake breakfast, and she couldn't stop raving about how it was the best she had ever tasted.

The cafe's location just off Canal Street allowed us to escape the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter. It was a great stop on our way to the cemeteries at the end of the streetcar line. If you're staying in the Quarter and want to explore beyond the tourist areas without a car, this is the place to go.

The service was excellent, and the staff created a wonderful dining experience. While the prices were slightly higher than average, they were reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. As a breakfast enthusiast, I highly recommend this cool and unique cafe.

Overall, Ruby Slipper Cafe exceeded my expectations. It's a great place to enjoy a delicious meal in a relaxed atmosphere. I would have given it a full 5 stars if not for the additional wait time even after being placed on the waitlist. So be prepared for a slight delay, especially for larger parties. Nevertheless, this cafe deserves all the praise it receives.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Local Harvest Cafe is a cute little spot located near Tower Grove Park and focuses on using local ingredients. As a vegetarian, I appreciated their extensive selection of vegetarian and vegan-friendly options. The atmosphere of the cafe is pleasant, although the seating area is quite small.

The food took a bit longer than expected to arrive, but it was worth the wait. I tried their veggie burger, which was tasty but not the best I've ever had. The hummus, garlic aioli, pickles, and greens complemented the homemade patty well, but it fell slightly short of my expectations.

For my drink, I opted for the PB & Banana smoothie, made with local peanut butter, organic bananas, soy milk, and yogurt. While the peanut butter flavor was strong, it overpowered the other ingredients. The consistency was more like juice than a smoothie, which was a bit disappointing.

On the bright side, the oatmeal butterscotch pecan bar was delightful. It had a perfect balance of flavors, and I imagine it would be even better warmed up.

Overall, Local Harvest Cafe is a decent choice if you're in the neighborhood. However, it wouldn't be my top preference for a dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Ichicoro Ramen is a must-visit if you're craving delicious ramen in Tampa. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a great vibe and awesome music. The service was outstanding, with attentive staff who made sure I had a fantastic dining experience.

The menu offered a great selection of drinks, and I highly recommend trying the Remedy or the Sake Soda for a light and refreshing option. As for the food, the Fried Chicken app and the Pork Buns were heavenly. The flavors were perfectly balanced, leaving my taste buds wanting more.

I opted for the Chambon Ramen, and I was blown away. The broth was light yet rich, with the biggest chunk of pork belly floating in it. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and every bite was a delight. It's no wonder this dish has received rave reviews from hundreds of satisfied customers.

"Hands down one of the better breakfast options on the northside. Attended during a late Friday morning for breakfast. Only seats that were available were at the bar which allowed for constant entertainment and for a coffee mug that was never empty. 

As we were both hungry we started with splitting the seasonal pop tart - a s'mores for the winter months. What was great is we did not ask which seasonal pop tart is available so we did not feel guilty having to start our day with chocolate and marshmallows. 

The Potato Waffle is exactly what you want in a starch. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. A large helping with the field greens and charcuterie sitting atop the gruyere. The egg atop this delicious tower was a perfect sunny-side up. 

The Traditional Benny was a solid offering with a lovely surprise of avocado. It appeared that the eggs were over-easy rather than poached but it did not affect the dish in any negative way. 

The Brussel Sprouts and Cabbage salad had a little too much dried fruit and bacon (I know, it is hard to believe) for our preference. We would have liked more of the greens in this offering. The fresh fruit, which seems to always be a gamble in the winter in Indiana, was a nice balance of melon to berries. Thankfully it was not a cup of tasteless honeydew or cantaloupe! 

If you are in the area, definitely a place to visit. If the wait is long and if you are not starving then it is worth the wait, as long as you can get a coffee while you wait!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I couldn't resist the Somas, as if a girl scout was trying to give it away to me! Both were fantastic! I NEED MORE! So I am planning a trip into their store for this weekend.

In addition to their spin on these confectionary treats, I loved their team they came with. They kept everything so tidy at their space. In addition everyone had gloves on and their hair tied back. Cleanliness is next to godliness, and I'm a firm believer in this. Everyone was eager to see us. My husband and I were greeted by name (from our nametags), which made the experience more personable.

"Restaurant review: Berryssimo Frozen Yogurt ★★★☆☆

I know it's just me, but I wasn't impressed with my experience at Berryssimo Frozen Yogurt. The ambiance of the place is nice, with a sleek slate stone wall and a cozy sitting area overlooking the street. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Sophie.

However, when it comes to the taste of the frozen yogurt, it fell flat. Despite the clear signs indicating the flavors, they all lacked in taste. I tried the Tahitian Vanilla, Very Berry, and Cookies & Cream, with some Blackberry and Reece Cup toppings. The texture was smooth and creamy, and the toppings were rich, but the yogurt itself lacked flavor. Even when I tried each flavor separately, there was no strong taste. For the nearly $8 price tag, it was disappointing.

Compared to the nearby ice cream shops, Berryssimo's frozen yogurt just didn't measure up. When indulging my sweet tooth, I want to be overwhelmed with pleasure, with a burst of flavor that lingers. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. Maybe I'm just immune to the experience of super chilled yogurt, but I wish I could have been satisfied like others seem to be.

Overall, Berryssimo Frozen Yogurt is a decent place with a pleasant atmosphere, but the lack of flavor in the yogurt itself leaves much to be desired. If you're looking for a truly satisfying frozen treat, I would suggest exploring other options in the area.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

First and foremost, the staff at FedEx Office Print & Ship Center deserves a special mention. The service was exceptional from start to finish. The team was friendly, attentive, and well-trained. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had the best dining experience possible. They were also extremely knowledgeable about the menu and able to answer all of my questions.

The dishes were made with fresh, high-quality ingredients that were evident in the taste and presentation. There were plenty of mouthwatering options to choose from, whether one preferred a light salad or a hearty sandwich.

I opted for one of their signature sandwiches, which was simply delightful. The bread was freshly baked, and the fillings were generous and flavorful. The attention to detail was admirable, and it was clear that the chef took great pride in creating each dish.

The restaurant also boasts an impressive beverage selection. From refreshing juices to expertly brewed coffees, there was something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the cappuccino, which was smooth and perfectly balanced. It was the perfect accompaniment to my meal.

The atmosphere of FedEx Office Print & Ship Center was something truly unique. The restaurant seamlessly blends a professional work area with a comfortable dining space.

"Nestled in the heart of our bustling city, Bonnies Body Works presents a dining experience that tantalizes the senses while providing comfort that feels almost as therapeutic as the massages by namesake Bonnie herself. The ambiance strikes a delicate balance between elegance and homeliness, inviting patrons to unwind as they peruse a menu replete with creative gastronomy.

Upon entering, one can't help but admire the clever use of space. Tables are well-appointed, neither cramped nor isolating, and the decor captures a soothing palette that complements the zestful dishes. The lighting is dimmed to just the right degree for an intimate dining experience.

Service was prompt and cordial, and our waiter exhibited a commendable knowledge of the menu. Recommendations were given with an infectious enthusiasm that heightened our anticipation for the culinary journey ahead.

The starter, a trio of seared scallops on a bed of cauliflower puree, was a symphony of flavors that set a high bar for the subsequent courses. The entree, a slow-roasted lamb shank, fell off the bone and was seasoned to perfection. The accompanying vegetables, however, were less memorable and would have benefitted from an equal amount of culinary finesse as the protein.

Desserts were a delightful endnote, with the chocolate torte being a standout - rich and indulgent without being cloying.

The sole drawback of the evening was a slightly overextended wait for the main course, a minor hitch in an otherwise seamless service.

In summary, Bonnies Body Works garners a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars. While there's slight room for improvement, it's a gem that beams with potential. An experience here isn't just a meal; it's an indulgent escape from the everyday - a reprieve promising to leave your tastebuds as contented as a well-kneaded muscle.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"It's hard not to like any place in Reading Terminal, especially when you finally find a table during the lunch rush, listening to the sounds of bustling people and live river-walk jazz...

But that's not the point - Mezze.  Damn-good Mediterannean food!  I had the lemon chicken sandwhich and lobster bisque and it was great - great ingredients and the soup was just right (can't stand salty-soup).  The price was a little on the high end, but it wasn't ridiculous.  What I was on the fence with was the roll my sandwhich was on being a little hard.  Maybe that's me and I'm just used to a nasty falling apart Philly-cheesesteak, but hard rolls with soft ingredients make for a tough-to-eat sandwhich.

Aside from that, I have no doubt that I'll be back to Mezze and I suggest you do the same.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

What truly sets Preservation Hall apart is their commitment to preserving the history and culture of the city. Throughout the evening, live jazz music played softly in the background, creating a warm and lively ambience. It was like dining in a jazz club, immersing myself in the soulful sounds that are synonymous with the city.

Although my experience at Preservation Hall was overall exceptional, I did encounter a small hiccup. The dessert I ordered took longer than expected to arrive, but the staff promptly apologized and offered a complimentary drink to compensate. Their willingness to make amends was commendable and it did not overshadow the overall positive experience.

In conclusion, Preservation Hall is a hidden gem that captures the essence of the city. Its delectable cuisine, friendly service, and the enchanting live jazz music make it a must-visit for both locals and tourists. With its cozy ambiance and commitment to preserving the city's cultural heritage, Preservation Hall easily earns a solid four-star rating.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Acapulco Taqueria is a gem! Every bite of their taco al pastor was a morsel of pure bliss—flavors perfectly balanced with tender meat, zesty pineapple, and fresh cilantro.

"Review:

I recently visited Baldpate Mountain and had an incredible experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. 

From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed by the friendly staff. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with a rustic charm that added to the overall ambiance. The interior design was well-thought-out, with a beautiful blend of modern and traditional elements.

The menu offered a wide variety of options, accommodating different dietary preferences and restrictions. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the ingredients used in each dish. The flavors were fresh and vibrant, making every bite a delight for the senses. 

One dish that stood out to me was their signature steak. Cooked to perfection, the meat was tender and juicy, bursting with flavor. The presentation was also top-notch, with each component of the dish meticulously arranged. It was clear that the chef took pride in their work.

The service was exemplary throughout my meal. The waitstaff was attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. They were knowledgeable about the menu and were able to make recommendations based on my preferences.

The restaurant itself was clean and well-maintained. The attention to detail was evident, from the polished silverware to the immaculate table settings. The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable, allowing me to truly enjoy my meal.

Overall, my experience at Baldpate Mountain was outstanding. The combination of great food, attentive service, and inviting atmosphere made for a perfect dining experience. I would without a doubt give it 5 stars and will certainly be visiting again in the near future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

The park is very lively and is utilized by all sorts of people; office workers, skate-boarders, tourists, etc. However, the actual park space is not that big. Even though it's a popular landmark, I don't think it's comparable to the Bean in Chicago in terms of size and space. For me, the park provided a nice recess from exploring the city all day.

The ginger cookie is also moist and perfect for a snack or dinner party. Colleen's has such a wide variety of sweets, mainly cookies, that I think anyone with a sweet tooth would be delighted by the selection they offer.

"Somehow, we ended up living only 6 blocks from this little spot...what luck.

The only negative thing I can say is that the decor is a nightmare. I would term it ""Hoosier Hodgepodge"". It's a perfect example of why most restaurants should pay a designer to decorate their space. 

The food is cheap and the portions are good-sized. The protein choices are shredded chicken, shredded beef, black beans, beef chili, or whipped pinto beans. You can choose your filling in a burrito, soft taco, hard taco, or nachos. All the toppings are included, if you want them, and this includes sour cream, cheese, black olives, tomatoes, etc. The thing that really sets this little restaurant apart are the house-made taco sauces. The mildest is called Cincinnati City Slicker, it's followed by Texas Brushfire, Smokin', and Too Darn Hot, and they work their way all the way up to the spiciest, Tonsillectomy and Lava, which are kept behind the counter. You apply your sauce after you receive your order. 

The owner is generally there, and he always greets us warmly and generally asks how the food was before we leave. He's a nice guy. All of the employees have been friendly too and we've never gotten an order that was wrong. Make sure you get one of those giant cookies too. They're thin, chewy, and very good. 

I think his is a good spot for kids because the chicken is pretty mild, the service is quick, and it's cheap. Nothing fancy that they're going to break and no servers to trip over them if they get up from the table.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"My recent visit to Tietra presented a mix of impressions. Ambiance-wise, Tietra sports a modern yet cozy decor with a relaxing vibe, which is a strong point for casual diners. The establishment is well-kept, with clean surfaces and a welcoming layout. Seating is comfortable with ample space, avoiding the crowded feeling even when busy.

Service-wise, the staff is polite but seemed somewhat distracted; it took a while for someone to take our order and check-ins were infrequent. This detracted from the overall dining experience, as we often found ourselves looking around for assistance.

The menu is an eclectic mix with a variety of options, suggesting a broad appeal but at the risk of spreading itself too thin. I decided on a seared salmon which was adequately cooked, yet it lacked the wow factor that would compel a return visit. My companion's pasta dish was pleasant but similarly unremarkable.

The wine list is decently curated, with options that pair well with the mains, and the cocktail that I tried was balanced, albeit slightly unadventurous.

Price points are reasonable; Tietra doesn't break the bank but doesn't offer the value-for-money that would elevate it in a diner's estimation.

In the realm of desserts, the chocolate mousse was a redeeming feature, striking the right notes of flavor and texture.

Overall, Tietra has potential but requires fine-tuning in terms of culinary innovation and service attentiveness to truly shine. As it stands, it merits a solid three stars, worthy of a casual visit but not yet a must-return destination.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Whitt's Barbecue-Belle Meade is hands down the best barbecue joint in town! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The smell of mouthwatering smoked meats filled the air, making it hard to resist ordering everything on the menu.

I opted for their signature pulled pork sandwich and it was truly a game-changer. The meat was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The barbecue sauce was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet, complementing the pork perfectly. Each bite left me craving more.

But it wasn't just the main dish that impressed me. The side dishes were equally as delicious. The coleslaw was crisp and refreshing, and the baked beans had just the right amount of smokiness. I couldn't get enough of their homemade cornbread, which was soft and buttery.

The service at Whitt's Barbecue-Belle Meade was exceptional. The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were more than happy to recommend their personal favorites, which added to the overall dining experience.

The prices at Whitt's Barbecue-Belle Meade were reasonable, especially considering the generous portion sizes. The quality of the food definitely outweighed the cost.

"From the moment I stepped into Hong Kong China Restaurant, I was enveloped in an ambiance reminiscent of the spirited streets of its namesake city. Captivating aromas wafting from the kitchen provided a tantalizing prelude to the culinary symphony I was about to experience. I was first greeted by the Crispy Duck, its skin perfectly bronzed to a heavenly crunch, juxtaposed with tender, flavorful flesh that melted in my mouth—a truly masterful rendition of a classic.

The Dim Sum selection, an array of exquisitely crafted bites, beckoned with the promise of authenticity. Each piece, from the plump, juicy Har Gow to the savory, delicate Siu Mai, was a testament to the chef's finesse with traditional techniques and recipes passed down through generations. The accompanying dipping sauces—each one a harmonic blend of ingredients—elevated the flavors to new heights.

The knockout dish, however, was the Hong Kong-style Lobster, stir-fried to sublime perfection. Bathed in a savory sauce that walked a tightrope between rich and refreshing, it showcased the natural sweetness of the seafood without overwhelming it. A standout performance.

Service was impeccable; attentive without being intrusive, the staff glided through the dining room with the grace of seasoned performers, each movement and interaction contributing to an overall sense of welcomeness and care.

As I left, the thought that resonated with me was that Hong Kong China Restaurant isn't merely a place to eat; it's a destination where one can plunge into the depths of Chinese gastronomy and emerge utterly satisfied. Unquestionably, this establishment earned every one of its five stars, making it a top contender for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience—a gem that I urge you not to miss.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The menu at Gran Caffe L'Aquila offers a wide variety of traditional Italian dishes, all expertly prepared with fresh ingredients. I started with the bruschetta, which was bursting with flavors and had the perfect balance of tangy tomatoes and fragrant basil. For my main course, I opted for the homemade pasta, which was cooked to perfection and accompanied by a rich and flavorful sauce. The portion sizes were generous, and every bite was a delight.

What truly sets Gran Caffe L'Aquila apart is their incredibly skilled staff. The friendly and attentive waitstaff made sure all my needs were met, and their knowledge of the menu was impressive. They were more than happy to recommend dishes and offer suggestions, ensuring that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional.

The restaurant's interior is elegant and inviting, with tasteful decor that transports you to Italy. The cozy seating arrangements and soft lighting created a warm and intimate ambiance, perfect for a romantic evening or a get-together with friends. The background music added to the overall relaxing atmosphere.

The only reason why I did not give Gran Caffe L'Aquila a full 5 stars is that the wait time for our food was slightly longer than anticipated. However, given the quality of the food and the impeccable service, it was a minor setback that did not overshadow the overall experience.

"Lunch experience was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back for dinner!
- arrived at 2pm so missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner crowd. Service was prompt and attentive
- tried the award winning t ravs and was impressed. Good size. Fried just right: not cracker crispy but fried enough to hold shape after biting (this is necessary because you aren't finishing it in two bites!). Only warning is filling was grayish color (veal?). May turn off kids used to brown filling 
- my wife got the carbonara and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of sauce clinging to the pasta which was perfectly al dente amd home made. I hate it when people drown good pasta in sauce and they had the ratio perfect. Great salt from the prosciutto, velvety texture from the egg and bite from the Parmesan. 
- I ordered a pizza and was very impressed. I would call it a pan pizza (slightly thicker crust) which held up well to the toppings and didn't bend or require the NY fold. Sauce was tangy and cheese was rich and smooth. 
- my son got the Caesars salad (he's in a phase). It was good enough that he ordered a second one and that's unusual for a pre-teen!

Nice outdoor seating, a place to play cornhole and have fun and indoor with bar seating etc. our service has always been good but Lorraine was exceptional this visit. I had previously only had the pulled pork sand and I raved about the great sauce selection. 
I have now also had the ribs and they are absolutely delicious also, perfect flavor and just enough tug in the bite. Very tender and juicy with a great smoky flavor. We drive a little ways to get here so it's not just a place we drop in but have to make a real decision to go get. I'm a bit disappointed they have changed their sauce line up as you know that's what sets BBQ places apart for the most part. The sorghum is great, the maple rye is good, not a fan of Carolina style so I can't tell you the name as I have only tasted it as a sample. Now the disappointing part, they have changed the Scotch Bonnet from a tangy sauce with some heat to a very hot sauce with a real pepper flavor, no tanginess. They have the Grim Reaper which is really hot but they've decided to make the Scotch bonnet almost if not as hot as that. 
I enjoyed soaking down my Q with Scotch Bonnet then adding the sorghum over that for a sweet and tangy slightly spicy mix....oh yuuuummmmm! 
That's a lost flavor now...... 
Everyones BBQ taste buds are different and I know that with enough requests they decided to change my favorite to please the masses I get it. I just thought the chef had it right the first time and the people could have Grim Reaper if they wanted real heat. 
We will still come for the great atmosphere, spectacular service and really good meat OH, AND THE COLLARD GREENS!!! Oh Lord those collard greens are amazing, I'll make the drive for those! The thought just doesn't make my mouth water like it did when they had that tangy spicy sauce.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Now, let's talk about the food. The menu at Timber Creek Park offers a wide selection of dishes to cater to all tastes. From mouthwatering appetizers to delectable main courses and irresistible desserts, they truly have something for everyone. The quality of the ingredients used in each dish was remarkable, and the flavors were incredibly satisfying. I particularly enjoyed the perfectly cooked steaks and the flavorful seafood options.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the presentation of each dish. Every plate was beautifully arranged, showcasing the culinary skills of the chef. It was obvious that a lot of care and passion went into every meal that was served.

The drink menu at Timber Creek Park was equally impressive. They offered an extensive selection of wines, cocktails, and other beverages to complement the meal. I was pleasantly surprised by the knowledge and expertise of the staff in recommending the perfect wine pairing for my meal.

The atmosphere at Timber Creek Park was relaxing and enjoyable. The interior design was tastefully done, with comfortable seating and a cozy ambiance.

"It's with a heavy heart that I must pen a review for The Alexander that's less than flattering. My anticipation was high when I approached the venue, admired for its aesthetic allure and local fame. However, my enchantment was short-lived.

Upon entering, I was met with a rather dispirited greeting—or lack thereof—from a host who appeared overwhelmed, despite the half-empty dining room. That should have been my first cue. The menu, while promising a culinary adventure, was an uninspiring scroll of tried-and-tested dishes, desperately lacking any spark of creativity or local flair.

The service that followed did little to lift my spirits. Our server seemed disconnected, not just from our table but from the act of service itself, delivering plates with an apathy that bordered on ennui. The food, alas, mirrored this sentiment. My starter, a supposedly zesty soup, was teporously lukewarm and under-seasoned. The main, a pan-seared fish that should have been the pièce de résistance, arrived overcooked and resting on a bed of soggy vegetables that spoke of neglect rather than nurture.

To add insult to culinary injury, the wait for each dish was agonizingly long, the room's ambiance tainted by the low murmurs of equally disenchanted patrons. Any potential redeeming quality, like the artful presentation of the dessert, was overshadowed by its bland taste.

Regrettably, The Alexander's current state is a far cry from its golden reputation. In a market brimming with innovative eateries and passionate service, The Alexander stands as a stark reminder of what happens when a dining establishment loses sight of the very basics that make for an enjoyable restaurant experience: food quality, service enthusiasm, and a touch of warmth. I can only hope this is a temporary setback and not a terminal decline.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Nudie's Honky Tonk promised a rollicking good time with its vibrant Nashville vibes, but my experience fell flat with sour notes both in service and cuisine.

The live music, a potential saving grace, was disappointingly lackluster and failed to capture the spirit of country classics. Service was painfully slow – our server seemed overwhelmed and distracted, leading to long waits and incorrect orders. The food, when it finally arrived, was a major letdown; the brisket was tough and dry, and the catfish po'boy lacked any distinguishing flavors. Even the drinks, a simple task, were mixed haphazardly and failed to impress. Sadly, the experience was disjointed, failing to deliver the hearty feast and foot-stomping entertainment I'd hoped for.

I of course ordered the birria. It is good! Not the best I have ever had, but it is good and satisfies my cravings. It is also pretty affordable, I think about $8. It comes with tortillas and one fixings like chile, cilantro and onion.

I love the simplicity of the place. If you want tacos or birria you come here. It is a comfortable place where people go during lunch or after work. There is Spanish tv in the background and a lot of chatter.

My only wish is that they stayed open longer, they close at 6 pm.

Also, there is a lady that sells buñuelos. It is a pastry kind of like elephant ears. They are delicious!!!! Please give them a try.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Just a solid breakfast place that is great to catch up with friends. This is almost a locals joint that is small so could run into a wait if on Sunday. I have been here several times and the breakfast burrito has never left me disappointed. Also just a heads up the servings are quite large so make sure don't over order. Also bloody marys here are perfect! The service is good and frienly which I truly appreciate after a long night or just with friends.

"The husbeast and I were running on fumes. We;d gotten up early, not eaten and dropped his car off for some much needed work (oil change, tires, et all) and had plans to see the new Mad Max movie at the Veteran's 24 theatre, but now our tummies were growling.  

What to do, What to do.. 

And there it was, sitting where Perkins used to be. Mission Barbecue. So we made a U turn and walked in. The people greeted us with warmth, and since it was our first visit, they explained everything to us without hesitation. the cashier even offered samples of the meat products before we ordered! That was awesome. 

Both of us ordered off their Meat Market menu, choosing to make it a combo, by getting a side and a drink with it. We also donated $2 to the Wounded warrior project and got a re-usable cup. If we bring it back in, they'll give us a buck off the next visit. 

The food we ordered was pulled pork with green beans and then Pulled pork with brisket (moist-they asked what we wanted) and coleslaw.  The meats were divine. The brisket was perhaps some of the best I've ever eaten. The pulled pork was flavourful too! Their sauces.. 6 of them in total- are a sweeping variety and there are 2 that I like. The Kc Twang and I forget what the other one was. LOL. 


One thing that I -really- like about this place is that they have a notice on the door that every day at noon, they ask that every one stands and observes the singing of the National Anthem.  We were there to witness that, and it made my heart swell with patriotic pride to see every person stand, every hand over their hearts and yes, people sang our National anthem.  A moment of unity, it was nice. 

They are heavily militiary and that's great! I noticed that the men behind counter, where they were chopping meat, were standing at attention, waiting for orders. I LOVE that they support the Wounded Warrior project. I hope that all the monies donated to the project via them goes directly there. 

We will certainly be back.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"My anticipation for a night at Pat O'Brien's was met with disappointment, necessitating a regrettable one-star rating. The iconic establishment, beloved for its signature hurricane cocktails and lively ambiance, fell remarkably short of expectations. From our arrival, service proved to be dismally inattentive; it took an age for our waiter to acknowledge our presence, and this lackadaisical approach persisted throughout the evening.

Once we managed to order, the food was a further letdown. The dishes were uninspired, a poor representation of New Orleans' rich culinary landscape. Our entrees arrived lukewarm, as if they had languished forgotten on the counter, and the flavors lacked the vibrancy one craves from Cajun and Creole cooking. Moreover, each dish seemed hastily assembled, void of the care one anticipates from a restaurant with such a revered name.

Pat O'Brien's atmosphere, usually its saving grace, was stifled by an uncanny silence in the piano lounge—a stark contrast to the expected dueling melodies that once contributed to a unique, buoyant experience. Even the usually bustling courtyard seemed resigned, lacking energy and vibrancy.

A venue such as Pat O'Brien's should find pride in its heritage and strive to represent New Orleans' spirit in every hurricane glass and plate of jambalaya. Instead, it seems to rely on past glories and a tourist clientele less discerning of quality or authenticity. For a city teeming with culinary and cultural gems, patrons would be better served seeking sustenance and revelry elsewhere in the French Quarter. One can only hope this experience was anomalous and not indicative of a once-cherished institution's decline.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I read a few other reviews about this location and I am not sure if it was because I went on my lunch break when it was not as crowded, but I had good service.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and asked my seating preference.  It was only me so I chose the bar. I had my laptop so I could do some work and I know that sometimes it is hard to get in and out of restaurants within the time frame of an hour lunch break.  I had no issues connecting to their Free Wi-Fi.  

My server was the lady working the bar (I am so bad with names) and she was great! My food was out in about 10 minutes and as always delicious. 

Friday's never disappoints. I have become addicted to their burgers. OMG! Why are they so good? I got the All American Stacked Burger with fries. Listen...it should be called the All American Smack Somebody Burger because it is that good. It is a double burger with all the best toppings, cheese (yah, of course) and bacon. Where there is love, there is always bacon. I could not possibly finish it because I ordered a meal that came with an appetizer and I was filled to the brim. Friday's has been around for a long time and unlike several other chains that have gotten boring, their menu just keeps getting better and better.  

Save room for dessert? The Tennessee Whiskey cake is Yum-diddly-umptious (hope I did Willy Wonka proud with that spelling)! It's a gooey toffee cake, with some kind of custardy glaze, pecans and a scoop of ice cream. 

I am trying to make it back with a friend before the endless apps are gone, but then again I won't be able to get the burger...oh decisions...decisions.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"As a seasoned restaurant reviewer, it is rare that I find myself at such a loss to find the silver lining at an establishment, but sadly, Parkway Bakery & Tavern left much to be desired. From the outset, the ambiance was underwhelming, with a décor that felt uninspired and lacking the warmth or charm one might expect from a neighborhood tavern.

While Parkway may have a reputation for their Po’boys, the experience was marred by service that was slow and disorganized. The wait time both to order and receive food was excessively long, creating a palpable frustration among diners, myself included.

Once the food did arrive, it unfortunately did not redeem the prior wait. The Po’boy, which I had heard good things about, was a letdown. The bread, rather than being the perfect blend of crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, was tough and detracted from the overall taste. The filling, although generous, was bland and seemed to be lacking in freshness and quality.

Moreover, the state of the facilities was disappointing. Cleanliness appeared to be an afterthought, with restrooms in a less than appealing condition, which always casts a doubt on the hygiene standards in the kitchen itself.

Every reviewer hopes to uncover hidden gems or at least provide constructive feedback, but our meal at Parkway Bakery & Tavern was a sequence of letdowns that could not be saved by the few positives, such as the ample parking space. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant, and it is my sincere hope that this establishment takes a serious look at improving both its service and culinary offerings.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Balkan Treat Box and I must say that it was quite an enjoyable experience. From the moment I stepped foot into the restaurant, I was greeted with warm and friendly smiles from the staff, who promptly seated me at a cozy table.

The ambiance of the restaurant exuded a charming and rustic feel, with its wooden furnishings and soft lighting. It was a perfect setting for a relaxed and enjoyable meal. The menu at Balkan Treat Box had an array of tempting options, and I soon found myself struggling to decide what to order.

Eventually, I settled on a mix of dishes that included the Kofta, which was a skewer of deliciously spiced ground meat, as well as the Cevapi, a traditional Balkan sausage. Both dishes were cooked to perfection, with the meat being juicy and flavorful. The accompanying side dishes of pickled vegetables and fresh-baked bread complemented the main dishes wonderfully.

One thing that truly stood out to me was the attention to detail in the presentation of the food. Each dish was beautifully arranged and showcased the vibrant and fresh ingredients used. It was evident that the chefs at Balkan Treat Box took great pride in their craft.

The service throughout the evening was impeccable. The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable, providing helpful recommendations and ensuring that I had everything I needed to enjoy my meal. The level of professionalism was commendable.

In terms of value for money, I found Balkan Treat Box to be reasonably priced. While it may not be the cheapest option in town, the quality of the food, combined with the impeccable service and inviting ambiance, made it well worth the price.

My only slight disappointment was the limited dessert options. While the Baklava I ordered was delicious, I would have liked to see a wider variety of sweet treats to choose from.

Overall, Balkan Treat Box is a hidden gem that offers a delightful dining experience. With its delicious menu, inviting ambiance, and attentive service, it's a place that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and enjoyable culinary adventure. I would certainly give it a solid four stars out of five.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"In NO way can the ice cream here compete with Bassetts or Franklin Fountain. What wins this place all the customers is the location. It's basically the only ice cream shop in the Art Museum. Everything else is FroYo that is tucked off away off the main roads. So I think the reason why this place has done so well is because it's literally like having a water fountain in the desert. I've gone here after races, after drinking, on my way home from a rough day, etc. It's just so nice that it's close by to home. 
They've got great Sundaes and lots of variety which I love. I'm sucker for choices even though I always get the same thing.

"Regrettably, my visit to General American Donut Company was an experience I'd rather forget. Expecting a delightful treat, I was instead greeted by a sobering array of stale, lackluster offerings that failed to live up to even mundane standards. The donuts, which should have been the stars of the show, were disappointingly dense and devoid of that fresh, airy quality one craves in a good pastry. The glazes and toppings, which promised ingenuity and decadence, were underwhelming and seemed to mask rather than elevate the base product.

Service was another sore point during this visit. My interactions with the staff were marked by indifference, as though my presence was a mere inconvenience rather than an opportunity for hospitality. Especially frustrating was the lengthy wait time, not justified by a rush or apparent busy period, which only exacerbated the sense of neglect and disorganization that permeated the atmosphere.

Moreover, the pricing felt unjustifiably inflated, considering the subpar quality. There's an expectation that higher costs correlate with superior experience or product, but the General American Donut Company failed to bridge that gap. Rather than leaving with the satisfaction of indulging in a premium treat, I felt as though I had wasted both my time and money.

In conclusion, this establishment falls far short of the mark in every category that defines a delightful culinary adventure. From flavor and freshness to service and value, the dissonance between the concept and the execution is stark. I cannot in good faith recommend this place, particularly to those who hold the humble donut dear.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I had wondered what would happen to the old Under the Rose location.  I had wondered if they would replace it with something similar or I wondered if they would dismantle the space that seemed to be so well designed.  Then I wondered if anything would happen with the Pandemic and so many places struggling to even get enough workers.

Not wondering anymore.  This Saturday we were able to go and try a few items.   I started with the Post It drink.  So perfectly tasty for an easy-going early lunch.  I ordered up the Cali-Cheese Steak and my wife ordered up the Jambalaya Balls.  We really really enjoyed the Jambalaya Balls.  The sauce that they were plated with was right on the money.  The Cali Cheese steak was a little awkward with the trip tip being too tough for a bite right through.  I probably wouldn't order it again even though the flavors were there.

I look forward to another trip there....and maybe this time I will be in the mood for flight of the beers they make on site.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Dat Dog and overall, it was a fantastic experience. I would rate it four stars out of five. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a vibrant and lively atmosphere that set the tone for a fun dining experience.

The menu at Dat Dog is impressive, offering a wide variety of uniquely crafted hot dogs and sausages. Being a hot dog lover myself, I was excited to try their infamous creations. I ordered the Crawfish Dog and the Alligator Sausage, both of which were flavorful and delicious. The toppings were fresh and the sausages were cooked to perfection. The combination of flavors in each bite was simply outstanding.

One aspect that really stood out to me was the service. The staff at Dat Dog were friendly and attentive, ensuring that I had everything I needed throughout my meal. They were also knowledgeable about the menu and provided great suggestions when I was undecided about which toppings to choose.

The ambiance of the restaurant was vibrant and energetic, with colorful decor and upbeat music playing in the background. The seating arrangements were comfortable and provided ample space for patrons to enjoy their meals. It was clear that Dat Dog has put effort into creating a casual and inviting atmosphere for their customers.

The only reason I didn't give it a full five-star rating is because of the wait time. Despite having made a reservation, I still had to wait for a table to become available. However, once seated, the food was served promptly, making up for the initial wait.

In conclusion, Dat Dog is a must-visit for hot dog enthusiasts looking for a unique twist on a classic favorite. With their wide selection of creative hot dogs and sausages paired with excellent service, it's a place that guarantees a fun and memorable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"As an European myself, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I loved the ambiance and choice of interior design, but it was lacking a little bit in the food. My husband ordered the meat lovers omelette and I ordered the smoked chicken salad on croissant with parmesan truffle fries. There was no smoky flavor in my chicken, there was melted cheese on there, so I am not sure if the sandwich was supposed to be warm or cold, it was somewhere in the middle. My husband's omelette was cold; the truffle fries were delicious, but WAY too salty. The waiter did not really spend a lot of time on our table to check in on us, but she was at least friendly. We brought home different cronuts, the texture felt like it was maybe 1 day old, but the flavor was good. My expectations have not really been met, but I definitely see the potential.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

My chopped salad wasn't even chopped! Let's be real guys, just because you cut the tofu into pieces doesn't make it chopped. My boyfriends spinach BLT salad was, as he put it ""a salad for ants"". Their salads are tiny as you can see in my picture.  I'm going to be hungry in less than two hours and when I do, I'm going to regret going to HipCityVeg and dropping $19.45 on two salads that were a tad misleading (there is nothing chopped about my chopped salad) and that can only constitute as a mid afternoon snack at best.

"The Red Ox Inn is a first-class fine dining experience in an understated, comfortable atmosphere. The vintage sign out front indicates that the Red Ox Inn has existed in some form for years, but the interior and menu indicate that the proprietors are forward-thinking.

Located in a small storefront in the Strathearn neighbourhood, the general ambiance is that of a clean, high quality neighbourhood restaurant, accented by white tablecloths and hardwood floors.

There are maybe about ten tables in total, but spaced well apart from each other. The restaurant isn't too quiet, but not too loud either. You can converse easily and listen to some carefully picked mid-tempo indie rock tunes in the background.

Naturally, the food is the star here. The focus is on great flavor and great texture while still presenting the food in a unique way.

In our party of four, three ordered the (Vegetarian) green pea, hazelnut, and white chocolate soup as an appetizer and everybody loved it. I had a little taste and concur.

I went for the beet salad with goat cheese and received a completely new interpretation of an old favourite. Instead of larger beets cut into rounds, this was served with small, halved beets instead. This salad, while tasty, didn't wow me the way the soup did.

But the pheasant I ordered as a main did. The bird was cooked perfectly, complete with crispy skin. I also appreciated the romesco that they served with it. I'm a sucker for romesco.

Dessert was also warm, awesome and delicious. Service was non-intrusive and efficient - just the way I like it. And while Red Ox Inn doesn't officially serve bread, we asked for some to sop up the soup and they provided us with some delicious, and buttered, rye bread to do so.

"There is a whole heck of a lot to love about this place!  We decided to go for the first time in the middle of the afternoon (2:30pm) during the week and there were still a decent number of people here.  Surprising, considering they haven't been open for very long and that is the down time.

Just the same, there were two servers working at the time and both of them were beyond spectacular.  Our server, Paul, made our visit incredibly enjoyable.

To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I'd heard they had shows, and that they do things like drag bingo, but if you weren't there during a show-time, you probably wouldn't even know (except for the signs that have days/hours of the special events).

Overall, this place is definitely set up for entertaining.  There is plenty of seating and a large stage in the middle of the main room where the bar is located.  You can get a view of it from almost any of the rooms.  They also have a good amount of outdoor seating, if you're of the smoking variety.

We ordered hamburgers.  Surprise!  This IS a hamburger joint, after all.  And it shows.  The burger was perfectly cooked, I ordered medium and it was just right.  Pay the extra $5 for the buffalo and you won't be disappointed.  

The fries are perfect, the macaroni and cheese was delicious and both of our burgers were excellent.  In the future, I'd probably be inclined to order an appetizer and split the burger with someone, though.  They are so big!

It would have been nice to see more creativity and bold flavors in the fillings.

The prices at El Taco Loco are reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes. However, it is worth mentioning that they do not serve alcohol, so it's a good opportunity to bring your own drinks.

One area where El Taco Loco could improve is the presentation of the food. The dishes looked somewhat messy, and I believe that a little more attention to detail in plating would enhance the overall dining experience.

The service was quick and efficient, with our food arriving promptly. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in making recommendations.

Overall, El Taco Loco is a decent place to satisfy your Mexican food cravings. While the food could be a bit more exciting, the friendly service and reasonable prices make it a worthwhile visit. I would give it a solid 3-star rating.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Our driveline in our 2005 Toyota 4-Runner needed repair work.   We have had our wonderful 4-Runner since September 2004, when we purchased it brand new from Reno Toyota.  One owner, no accidents, perfect condition.  My favorite car I've ever owned!! Besides regular maintenance from our most awesome mechanics at Preferred Auto, we've had zero problems with this vehicle.   Apparently there is some messed up defect with the 4-Runners on the 2004-2006 models.  In researching this issue on the internet, seems to me there should have been a Toyota recall....anyway, we are a Toyota family.  Love Toyotas for their reliability and we almost traded in our SUV this past weekend thinking omg - what's next to come if the driveline is a problem?  Our trusted friend Tom, owner of Preferred Auto, recommended Driveline and Gear Service.   Tom thought it's well worth it to repair our SUV as it will probably run forever.  Took a few days to get the appt - which is a good sign in my mind that this place is busy!   Our initial quote was a bit higher than we actually paid because less work was needed.  I'm so glad we didn't trade in our great vehicle!  The mechanics at the shop also said it was in great shape.  I'd hate to trade it in and have Toyota salesmen salivating over it like they do when I've driven it there to buy other cars.  We are going to drive it til it can't drive anymore!  Thanks for a great job on putting my baby back together and now she's her old self.  Like brand new!!   I would recommend Driveline and Gear Service to anyone with this similar problem.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"From the enchanting ambiance to the impeccable service, Oobatz offers an unrivaled dining experience that sets the benchmark for all culinary destinations. My visit to Oobatz was not simply a meal, but a symphony of flavors, sights, and sounds that tantalized all senses from the very moment I stepped through the door.

As I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere, the staff struck a perfect balance between professionalism and personable interaction. Attention to detail wasn’t just an aim—it was their standard. From the linen-draped tables to the meticulously arranged décor, Oobatz exuded a charm befitting its five-star rating.

The menu, a masterpiece of culinary creativity, showcased a variety of dishes crafted from the freshest local produce. The Harmony of Flavors appetizer, a medley of artisanal cheeses and house-made chutneys, set the taste buds alight with bold and contrasting flavors, artfully combined to heighten each individual ingredient.

The main course, an elegantly plated filet mignon, was prepared to perfection—charred slightly on the outside, flawlessly pink and tender within. Each bite melted in the mouth, bolstered by a velvety red wine reduction that sang of depth and intricacy. Accompanied by a side of perfectly seasoned heritage vegetables, the dish was a beautiful homage to both the local farmers' labor and the chef's skill.

Dessert was an affair to remember: the Decadent Chocolate Sphere, an orb of fine chocolate melting away under a stream of warm, spiced berry coulis to reveal a delicate, airy sponge cake, paired with homemade vanilla bean ice cream; it wasn't just a treat, it was a grand finale beyond compare.

Furthermore, the beverage selection—a curated list of wines, craft beers, and artisanal cocktails—complemented the meal exquisitely, enhancing the experience with every sip.

The excellence of Oobatz extends far beyond the plate. It's a celebration of the senses, a warm embrace in gastronomic form, and a testament to the art of fine dining. Oobatz is not just a restaurant; it is a destination worthy of a culinary pilgrimage. This is a five-star experience that I wholeheartedly recommend, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently dined at Greek Lady and unfortunately, it was an incredibly disappointing experience. From the moment I walked in, the service was incredibly slow and unprofessional. It took an unreasonable amount of time for someone to take my order and even longer for the food to arrive. 

The quality of the food was subpar to say the least. The Greek salad lacked freshness and the dressing was overpowering. The gyro meat was dry and tasteless, and the pita bread was stale. I couldn't believe I was actually eating Greek cuisine. 

To make matters worse, the ambiance was far from inviting. The restaurant felt cramped and outdated, with uncomfortable seating arrangements. The lack of cleanliness was also evident, as there were dirty dishes on surrounding tables. 

Despite the disappointment, I decided to give the dessert a chance. However, the baklava was a letdown. It tasted bland and lacked the richness and sweetness that baklava is known for. 

Overall, I cannot recommend Greek Lady to anyone looking for an enjoyable dining experience. The slow service, mediocre food, and lackluster ambiance were major letdowns. With so many other Greek restaurants in the area, I highly suggest exploring other options instead.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"Example 2: Restaurant name = The Nail Spa; Number of characters = 4; Number of stars = 4.0.
Review 2: The Nail Spa exceeded my expectations and left me feeling pampered and relaxed. The ambiance of the salon was serene and calming, instantly putting me at ease. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure I was comfortable throughout my visit.

I opted for a manicure and pedicure, and I was pleased with the results. The nail technician was skilled and meticulous, taking the time to shape and file my nails to perfection. The polish application was smooth and even, giving my nails a polished and professional look.

The spa services at The Nail Spa were top-notch. The hand and foot massages were heavenly, melting away any tension or stress I had. The products used were of high quality and left my skin feeling nourished and hydrated.

The only reason I am not giving The Nail Spa a full 5 stars is because of the price. While the quality of service certainly justifies it, the prices are on the higher side compared to other salons in the area.

"Circle K surprisingly transcends the familiar confines of its convenient store roots, delivering an unexpectedly delightful dining experience that's deserving of a full five stars. Upon arrival, the warm, inviting atmosphere sets the stage for a culinary journey that defies expectation. The establishment is meticulously clean, suggesting a level of care that transfers into their food preparation.

The menu, though not extensive, is impressively curated, featuring a selection of sandwiches, hot dogs, and snacks that are perfect for a quick yet satisfying bite. I opted for their signature hot dog, which was a revelation – a perfectly cooked, snappy sausage nestled within a soft, fresh bun, topped with just the right amount of condiments. Each bite was a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, the kind of simple pleasure that redefines what fast food can be.

What really elevates Circle K above its peers, however, is the level of customer service. The staff exhibited a friendly demeanor and genuine enthusiasm for their offerings, which often is not the case in quick-service settings. They were attentive without being intrusive, ensuring my dining experience was comfortable and enjoyable.

Circle K also offers a plethora of snacks and beverages to complement the meal. I indulged in a cup of their robust coffee, which was the perfect accompaniment to the savory hot dog. For dessert, there was an array of fresh, delectable pastries that paired wonderfully with the last sips of coffee.

In a world where fast and convenient is often synonymous with compromise, Circle K stands as a testament to what can be achieved when quality and convenience converge. It’s a rare find that delivers an exceptional experience worthy of a return visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I had high hopes for a cozy brunch at Coffee Mill, drawn in by the quaint exterior and the promise of rich aromas, but my experience fell far short of expectations. The moment we entered, we were met with a musty smell, overshadowing what could have been a delightful olfactory greeting of coffee and baked goods.

The service was lackluster at best. Staff seemed uninterested in customers, passing by our table without offering a greeting or a smile. When I finally managed to place my order, the barista got my drink wrong. Upon polite correction, I was met with a huff rather than an apology.

As for the coffee, it was bitter, burnt-tasting, a far cry from the artisanal experience suggested by the café's aesthetic. My scone, advertised as freshly-baked, was dry, crumbly, and seemed to have been reheated several times over.

The ambiance, which could have been Coffee Mill's saving grace, was marred by a strange mix of outdated tunes playing just a tad too loudly, making conversation a chore. The furniture, while rustic and charming in appearance, was uncomfortable and cramped.

Cleanliness was another sore point; the floor was sticky, tabletops were dusty, and the restroom lacked the most basic sanitary supplies.

In conclusion, while Coffee Mill may have the potential for a quaint coffeehouse experience, it is desperately in need of improvement in multiple areas. Unfortunately, as it stands, I cannot recommend this establishment.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Aman's Indian Bistro and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. I would give it a solid 5 stars out of 5.

Firstly, the ambiance of the restaurant was captivating. The warm lighting, elegant decor, and soothing Indian music created a relaxed and inviting atmosphere. The staff was welcoming and attentive, ensuring that every guest felt comfortable and well looked after.

Moving on to the highlight of the evening - the food. Aman's Indian Bistro truly delivered an exquisite culinary journey. The menu featured a wide range of authentic Indian dishes, each bursting with flavors and vibrant spices. The presentation of each dish was impeccable, showcasing the care and attention to detail that went into its creation.

I started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was a revelation. The flavors were perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of heat and a velvety texture. For the main course, I couldn't resist trying the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was cooked to perfection. The chicken was tender and succulent, smothered in a rich and creamy tomato-based sauce that left me craving for more. Additionally, the vegetable biryani was fragrant and full of aromatic spices, complementing the main dishes perfectly.

The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling satisfied. The prices were reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food. Moreover, the staff was knowledgeable about the dishes and gladly offered recommendations.

To conclude, my experience at Aman's Indian Bistro was nothing short of delightful. The exceptional ambiance, attentive service, and delectable food made it a memorable dining experience.

"We knew of Knifewear before it came to Edmonton because we had visited the Calgary store a few times. We were excited when we heard they were opening a store in Edmonton. We both like to cook so were hoping to get some nice knives for ourselves.  They had an Opening Party when they first opened and this was my first time actually trying out the knives. I was very impressed by the staff knowledge of the knives and the high quality of the Japanese blades they offer.

I ended up getting a medium length Chef's knife because it is multi-purpose and is the type of knife I use the most in the kitchen.  I loved my Canadian Tire Santuko chef's knife and used it all the time so I figured getting something along that line would be my best bet for a first Japanese knife. I ended up getting the Fujimoto Nashiji Santoku 165mm. It was one of the more affordable knife lines but I really liked the look and feel of it. I now use it everyday for almost everything in the cooking department.

These Japanese knives can sure cut! They can be sharpen to almost a razor thin edge. You can cut vegetables way thinner then you ever thought possible. You will want to get a honing rod so that you can keep your knife sharp. Every once in awhile you can take it back into the shop for a proper sharpening too.

The store has lots of other cool kitchen gear as well. Stuff you won't find in your regular kitchen store.

"Review Title: Disappointing Experience at Greene Street

I recently dined at Greene Street and sadly, my experience was far from satisfactory. I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the overall quality of the food and service, which led me to give this restaurant only 2 out of 5 stars.

Starting with the ambiance, it felt rather dull and uninspiring. The decor seemed outdated and in need of a refresh. Moreover, the lighting was dim, making it difficult to read the menu and truly enjoy the atmosphere. The noise level was also quite high, making it hard to hold a conversation without raising our voices.

Moving on to the service, it was slow and inefficient. Our server took a long time to even acknowledge our presence and once they did, their attitude seemed indifferent. We had to repeatedly ask for refills on our drinks and the wait time between ordering and receiving our food was much longer than expected.

When it came to the food itself, it was underwhelming. The menu boasted an array of options, but the execution left much to be desired. The dishes lacked flavor and were far from memorable. The presentation was also lackluster and did not reflect the prices charged on the menu. It was evident that little care or attention was put into the preparation of the meals.

Furthermore, the portions were disappointingly small, especially considering the prices. We left the restaurant feeling hungry and unsatisfied. It truly felt like a missed opportunity for the restaurant to make a positive impression.

"I recently had the opportunity to dine at Memphis Taproom, and I must say, I was quite disappointed with my experience. I had high hopes for this place, considering all the positive reviews I had heard. However, it did not live up to the hype.

Firstly, the service was incredibly slow and inattentive. It took forever for a server to even acknowledge our presence, let alone take our order. And once we finally got our food, it seemed like an eternity for them to bring us the bill. It was frustrating and made the whole dining experience feel rushed.

Secondly, the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the BBQ ribs, hoping for some tender and flavorful meat. Unfortunately, they were dry and lacked any real smoky taste. The side dishes were equally lackluster, with the mac and cheese being bland and rubbery. It felt like they had just thrown some dishes together without much thought or care.

Additionally, the atmosphere of Memphis Taproom was not very appealing. The place was dimly lit and had a rather dingy feel to it. The tables were sticky, and the noise level was uncomfortably loud. It was difficult to have a conversation without shouting across the table.

Lastly, the prices were not justified by the quality of the food or service. I felt like I was paying a premium for what should have been a casual dining experience. Unfortunately, it was not worth the cost.

"Looks great from the outside, but the servers seemed to be hungover from the night before and the food wasn't great either.

Sat for at least ten minutes before a waiter approached our table whispering ""Were you recently seated?"" Not really, but let's roll with it.

Ordered two screwdrivers with ""freshly squeezed"" orange juice that we were promptly told was actually bottled. The OJ wasn't bad, but my drink was mixed improperly and had too much vodka in it (not the worst thing in the world, but I ended up taking four sips).

We ordered some of whatever Tackle Box's take on fried oysters is, and we enjoyed it. This was the highlight of our dining experience. Having to stop our waiter from removing the plate while there was still an oyster left detracted somewhat.

I ordered the breakfast burger medium rare with a fried egg over easy. It came out well done. The fried egg was actually two eggs. I'm not sure if this is a southern thing but one egg is usually too much to handle, trying to fit two eggs on a burger is ludicrous. The bun was also puny in diameter and the bottom half was--you guessed it--soggy after sitting out for too long. The tomatoes were supposedly grilled but they didn't seem to have any char on them at all. Easily the worst burger I have had this year.

I was more than impressed coming from a city where the cocktail scene had been really pushing the limits as of late. Their gin cocktails are just delicious, and the bartenders and owner are amazing. I also had the pleasure of trying their absinthes as well, if I'm not mistaken the namesake of the restaurant did  the absinthe preparations - wonderful.

"I recently had the most unique dining experience at the Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site, and I must say it exceeded all my expectations. This extraordinary restaurant offers an unforgettable ambiance and an incredible glimpse into history. 

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by friendly staff dressed in period costumes, adding to the immersive atmosphere. The restaurant is located within the historic walls of the former prison, and the architecture alone is awe-inspiring. The high ceilings, intricate ironwork, and hauntingly beautiful cells create an atmosphere unlike any other.

The menu at Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site is equally impressive. They offer a range of culinary delights, with a focus on dishes inspired by the local cuisine. I opted for the chef's tasting menu, and each course was a masterpiece. The flavors were bold and expertly executed, and the presentation was a visual delight.

The service was impeccable throughout the evening. The waitstaff was knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations. They were attentive without being intrusive, ensuring that my dining experience was seamless from start to finish.

What truly sets this restaurant apart is the opportunity to explore the rest of the historic site. After enjoying my meal, I was allowed to roam the grounds and learn about the prison's history through informative exhibits. The staff was more than willing to answer any questions, making the overall experience educational and engaging.

I left Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site with a newfound appreciation for both the culinary arts and history. This restaurant offers an unparalleled experience that blends fine dining with a unique setting. If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience that will leave you with not only a satisfied palate but also a rich understanding of the past, then this is the place for you.

"Restaurant Name: The Melting Pot
Rating: 1 out of 5 stars

My experience at The Melting Pot was extremely disappointing. From the moment I walked in, I could tell this place was in desperate need of an upgrade. The outdated carpet and old restroom left me questioning the cleanliness of the kitchen.

The menu offered a ""SKINNY DIP"" option for $19.99, which included a limited selection of salads and entrees served with dark chocolate for dessert. While it may seem like a good deal, the cheese fondue had to be ordered separately, resulting in additional costs. I felt like I was being nickel and dimed for the full experience.

The food itself was mediocre at best. The dishes lacked flavor and creativity, and it was clear that attention to detail was not a priority in the kitchen. I expected more from a restaurant that claims to offer an interactive and memorable experience.

On a positive note, our server was friendly and attentive. However, this alone could not make up for the overall lackluster experience. The restaurant was full on a Sunday night, but I couldn't help but wonder if people were just unaware of the better options available.

I left The Melting Pot feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The worn-out facilities and uninspiring menu left a lasting negative impression. For the price I paid, I expected much more. Unless significant improvements are made, I cannot recommend The Melting Pot to others.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

In addition to the delicious food, the presentation was also on point. Each dish was beautifully plated, making it even more enjoyable to eat. 

Not to mention, their coffee was some of the best I've had in a long time. The barista really knows their craft and it showed in every cup. Whether you like a bold espresso or a smooth latte, Drip Cafe has got you covered.

This lounge is attached to a hotel so initially had to take an elevator to their rooftop but once the doors open I was taken away. They definitely get an A+ for decor and ambiance.

The decorative pillows where I was seated appeared to be a little dirty but I like the concept lol My food was pretty good. I got a Crab Melt.

"Although I really wanted to love Savanna MedSpa... it just didnt happen for me. I had initially bought a groupon for 6 facials+2 ipl treatments for $225 up to $640 dollars worth of facial+ipl services to help with my acne. Unfortunately I stopped going after my 3rd acne facial, because I had some concerns that their acne ""clearing"" facials were hurting me more than helping. First off let me say in general the acne facials hurt, well let me clarify.. the extractions during the acne facial is so (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) PAINFUL. They essentially prep your skin and then use a metal tool that has a metal loop at the end to press your pimples out. I had to clench my jaw and I even started sweating because I felt like I was being given a slow painful death.. all while lying on nice satin sheets. 

After my first acne facial.. my pores were bleeding.. and my face was really bruised.. I couldn't go out for the next 2 days because lets face it I looked like shit...While I checked out though and drank their vitamin C cocktail, I remember them assuring me it would get better after the first time, and that everything was normal!
Fastforward one week later.. I ended up getting a huge cold sore + MULTIPLE BREAKOUTS from their chemical peel. I really don't know if they knew what they were doing because they might have started me on a strong peel even though I told them I never had one before. When I came back for my 2nd scheduled acne treatment, I told them I had a cold sore breakout 2.5 weeks ago right after my first treatment and the lady admitted its a side effect from the chemical peels.. because essentially it draws out all the impurities in the skin.

OK second treatment.. I sucked it up and cried lots more all for the sake of beautiful skin... same results, painful bruising... and it was not very relaxing or rewarding. This time though the esthetician extracts a pimple that was not ready to be extracted and I nearly died.... sure enough a couple of days later my face breaks out again, and let me note that during this 2nd time, I didn't get the chemical peel so I surmised it had to be from poorly done extractions. After my acne finally calms down I notice I had acne scarring from where the esthetician had extracted the ""unready"" pimple... this really pissed me off because now I had acne scars where I previously never had.... 


Ok third treatment.. ugh I don't even though why I went back.. perhaps it was because I didn't want to feel like I was throwing my money down the toilet.... and to save you some reading the same thing happened during and after facial (pain...bleeding.. bruising, breakout, scarring) 

This is when I just decided to STOP... and go to another esthetician (Brenda Griffin at faces plus) to help REVERSE the damage Savanna did to my skin. Prior to going to Savanna I did have blackheads.. but I didn't have crazy white heads, and I didn't have massive breakouts on my forehead. After going to Savanna though everything was just much worse.. crazy breakouts in my temple area where the estheticians's extracted...visible acne scarring.. and lower self-confidence. When I called in a couple of weeks ago to see if I could apply my other $112.50 on other services.. since I paid $225.00 for 6 facials and 2 IPLS, and I only received 3 facial services they said it wasn't possible. What a bummer.. because although the ambiance+friendly staff is A+ here, their acne facials were just terrible. I figured I could maybe redeem the rest of my money on a massage or something.. but I couldn't. So to sum it all up I paid $112.50 for pain+even worse off skin, and then lost the remaining half.. thus Savanna only deserves 1 star in my book.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

The indoor (fake) terraces and painted ceiling to mimic a sky were absolutely lovely.

Some of the tap beers were out when we showed up to watch the world cup game....that was a bummer.  good thing they have a ton to choose from so we were not thirsty....

"Nestled within the cozy confines of Hampton Inn St. Louis/Fairview Heights, my dining experience was surprisingly delightful. The ambiance struck a lovely balance of comfort and sophistication, presenting an inviting atmosphere that beckoned for a relaxing meal. 

The service was prompt, attentive without being intrusive, and our server exhibited a warm professionalism that set a positive tone for the evening. Each course was served in a timely manner, and the staff was knowledgeable, assisting us with menu options and recommendations that aligned perfectly with our tastes.

The restaurant prides itself on its well-curated menu featuring a fusion of local and international cuisine. The appetizers were a tantalizing prelude to the main courses, with the crispy calamari being a standout—an absolute must-try for seafood aficionados. The entrees maintained this high standard; my ribeye steak was cooked precisely to my request, a tender medium-rare, and paired beautifully with a robust, house-made sauce.

The only slight disappointment came from the dessert selection, which, while enjoyable, lacked the inventiveness found in the earlier courses. Nevertheless, the classic chocolate mousse was a satisfying end to a largely impressive meal.

In summary, Hampton Inn St. Louis/Fairview Heights offered a dining experience that exceeded expectations commonly associated with hotel restaurants. Its focus on customer service, a diverse menu with well-executed dishes, and a charming ambiance contribute to its worthy rating of four out of five stars.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Chick-fil-A, and I must say I was quite impressed with my overall experience. From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was greeted with warm smiles and friendly greetings from the staff. The atmosphere was clean and inviting, with a modern yet cozy interior.

One thing that immediately stood out to me was the speed of service. Despite it being a busy lunch hour, the line moved quickly, and I received my order promptly. The staff seemed well-trained and efficient, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free ordering process.

Now, let's talk about the food. Chick-fil-A's menu offers a variety of options, from classic chicken sandwiches to tasty salads and wraps. I decided to go for their signature Chick-fil-A Deluxe sandwich, and I was not disappointed. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked and juicy, topped with crispy lettuce, tomato, and a delicious mayonnaise-based sauce. The bun was soft and toasted, adding the right amount of texture to the overall sandwich. The flavors were well-balanced and left me craving for more.

Accompanying my sandwich, I opted for their waffle fries which were delightful. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they were the perfect accompaniment to the main dish. The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling satisfied and content.

Another aspect I appreciated about Chick-fil-A was their commitment to customer satisfaction. Throughout my meal, the staff made regular rounds to ensure everything was to my liking and promptly addressed any queries or concerns. Such attentiveness and willingness to go above and beyond contributed to my positive dining experience.

My only slight disappointment was the limited vegetarian options available. While they do offer a Chick-n-Strips salad, I believe it would be beneficial for the restaurant to expand their vegetarian offerings to cater to a broader audience.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Chick-fil-A and would highly recommend it. With its friendly and efficient service, delicious food, and inviting ambiance, it certainly deserves the solid 4-star rating.

My only issue was that when we sat at the smaller bar to play video slots of course we assumed that the drinks were free. After we received the drinks we also got a check. When I asked the barmaid advised ""oh the drinks aren't free here"". Guess we spent too much time in Atlantic City. 

Went back a few times since and the last being this past Friday. It was crowded and the servers were not very plentiful. Played some video poker and found that the service was alot beter in that area. Ordered a drink which came pretty quickly. On the servers next round she actualy had another for me without even asking so that was a plus.

"First off, I just want to say that this was my first time EVER getting gel nails done (I'm 26 years old). 

My mom and I visited a couple of weeks ago to get a mani/pedi before my brother's wedding. We didn't want to spend too much though especially since we never get our nails done. As I walked into the nail salon, I told the guy at the front I wanted the classic mani/pedi, and then he goes ""Do you want foil, gel, powder, etc?"" A. I don't know what any of that means. B. Any first-timer would assume this is included in the classic nail package. (Turns out gel was $15 extra which of course we didn't find out about until the very end when we were about to pay). 

The pedicure was nice and basic. She used lukewarm water and cold at times, and I noticed the back massage much much later almost at the end of my pedi.

Quality- good bbq

I stopped in for lunch as soon as they opened at 11. The restaurant isn't very big, so I can imagine that when they get busy, there's a line. There's a small full service bar. I ordered the pulled pork & green chili burrito for lunch.  I had the Cole slaw as my side.  These two items really don't go together, but I do love a good Cole slaw.  The slaw was creamy but not over-dressed. The dressing was not overly sweet or vinegary.  It was a nice balance.  It could have used a little salt.  The burrito was stuffed full of pulled pork.  It's then covered with melted shredded cheese & labeled with the green chili.  I feel like this could use more green chili & maybe a queso instead of shredded, melted cheese.  The pork was tender & juicy & it had a great smoke flavor throughout the meat. The meat was the only filler in the burrito.  This was pleasing & somewhat disappointing at the same time.  I appreciate the generous amount of pork in the burrito, but it just needed something.  It came with sour cream & salsa on the side.  I used the sour cream but I didn't care for the salsa.  It had a slight astringent taste. My server was very attentive & friendly and she answered every question I had without being annoyed.  I also ordered the brisket burnt ends to go. I had intended to have these for my dinner.  They didn't last that long.  Although most of the burnt ends were still juicy, some of them were way too far gone to be enjoyable.

Now let's talk about the food. Oh my goodness, the food! I ordered their famous Gyros and Chicken combo, and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. The pita bread was soft and warm, and the Tzatziki sauce added a refreshing tanginess to the dish.

The menu at Athenian's Gyros & Chicken is extensive, offering a wide variety of options for everyone's taste. Whether you're a fan of souvlaki, falafel, or spanakopita, there is something for everyone to enjoy.

"I wanted to get take-out from the area and was feeling something healthy and light. My first experience at Fuel when I got a sandwich was pretty good so I thought why not give it another try!?!
I got two orders -it was a busy day for me so I wanted to save the 2nd order for dinner :) I got the Shrimp and Avocado Salad for lunch. I was not a fan of this. I would give 2 stars for this. The lemon vinaigrette dressing had no flavor. It tasted like an ""appetizer dressing"" rather than a ""lunch dressing"" if you get what I mean.... The salad overall was lacking in flavor as well. I added craisins, sunflower seed, and feta chesse at home when I was halfway done. The avocadaos were not fresh either. I was so disappointed in this salad and will never get it again. 
However, the Grilled chicken in a wheat wrap was decent. I think the balsamic reduction gave the wrap a nice end to the taste. The chicken was tender, artichokes were slightly salty but came in an abundant amount, I could not taste the tomato spread that  much..but the wrap was nicely wrapped and my dinner did not end up messy. 
So the overall vibe I get from Fuel everytime I come here for food or drinks...it's very unique. I like it b/c I don't feel like I swallowed a hamburger and feel gross. You'll def feel light and healthy after a full meal, but I am never fully satisfied b/c there's no good grasp to the taste. Will I ever go back again? Yes most likely-but I will keep on ordering something different until I find that GOOD meal !",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Macarons in Tucson!

I was so happy to discover this place existed and even more pleased once I had sampled the perfect deserts Woops has to offer.

The macarons are brilliantly good. Just the right combination of chewy and crunchy. Each has a hint of flavor that doesn't overpower the delicious base. 

And there are some impressive flavors. I think that the Earl Grey is my favorite, but I seriously haven't had one I didn't like (and you can rest assured that I have done due diligence).

But it isn't just the precious little cookies at Woops. There are giant traditional cookies, scones and lots of other goodies. Everything we've tried has been super tasty.

My daughter now begs for macarons (she may be only four, but her pronunciation is perfect).

And now that I know Woops is a thing, you better believe I am getting my fill before school is back in session and it's impossible to find a parking spot on University!

We've made a habit of grabbing Kababeque for dinner and then heading to Woops for dessert. Sure, Indian and French together sounds weird... but it's two of our favorite things, so we roll with it.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"In-N-Out Burger embodies the classic American fast-food experience with an unparalleled commitment to quality that sets it apart, warranting a rare but resolute 5-star rating. From the moment I approached the iconic, buzzing venue, the aroma of fresh beef patty sizzling on the grill was utterly enticing. The décor is unpretentious, a nod to the nostalgic burger joints of yesteryear, yet spotlessly clean and inviting. 

The menu is a study in simplicity and focus. I ordered the Double-Double, their signature burger. It arrived in a no-frills presentation, letting the ingredients speak for themselves. The patties were juicy and perfectly cooked with a slight char on the edges, cradled between toasted buns that were soft yet firm enough to hold everything together. Fresh lettuce and tomato slices added a refreshing crunch, complemented by the secret spread which provided a tangy kick that tied all the flavors harmoniously. 

The fries, hand-cut in the store, were a crispy golden delight, evidently cooked in pure, cholesterol-free sunflower oil. My milkshake, thick and flavourful, was a throwback to classic American diners. In-N-Out’s commitment to freshness — with no microwaves or freezers — is evident in every bite. Coupled with the warm, efficient service, my dining experience left an indelible impression. In-N-Out doesn’t just serve food; it delivers a taste of timeless, uncomplicated Americana, and it does so with remarkable finesse.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"My biggest complaint with Five Guys is not the taste of the Burger.  The Burger is really quite good. Very possibly one of the best you can get at a chain.  My problem is that its literally TOO MUCH burger by the time you are done ordering even a small amount of the free toppings.   Every time I've been there I end up with this Burger PACKED with toppings that proceeds to slide right off the bun.  This most recent time the better half asked me ""Are you eating a lettuce burger?"" because at about 3/4 my Burger had fallen hopelessly into two burgers and I just got tired of trying to rebuild it.  If they provided just a bit more bun with the Hamburgers maybe this wouldn't be a problem.

Also, parking at this location in the evening is a bit crazy. As it was we parked in ""10 minute"" parking because there was literally nothing else open.  I doubt it was being enforced at the late hour we were there, but it still sticks in the mind while you are trying to eat.

Service was with a smile, and its comforting when the cashier remembers you ""By number"" and you don't have to grab the numerically assigned bag, instead it was handed directly to me along with two other 'numbers'

Until they get an In-N-Out this far east, I'm sure I'll be back for more Five Guys",HUMAN,Yelp,0

You can even do your kids bday party here. Very reasonable in pricing and the pizza for the kids are included with the package price.  I believe just renting a park bench costs the same amount as their parties. Plus they set everything up! No brainier.... My 3 year old has so much fun when he comes here.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Farrow Sandwiches & Coffee, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. I instantly fell in love with the cozy and rustic ambiance, which made me feel right at home.

The menu at Farrow is a delightful mix of inventive sandwiches and delectable coffee options. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in guiding me through their selection. After much deliberation, I opted for their famous Grick Middle sandwich and a cup of their Ethiopian blend coffee.

When my order arrived, I was blown away by the presentation. The Grick Middle sandwich was a masterpiece of flavors and textures. The combination of slow-braised local beef, caramelized onions, tangy horseradish aioli, and peppery arugula on a perfectly toasted baguette was simply divine. Every bite was a burst of harmonious flavors that left me wanting more.

The coffee at Farrow was equally impressive. My cup of Ethiopian blend had a rich and bold flavor profile, with notes of dark chocolate and a hint of citrus. It was expertly brewed and provided the perfect balance to my sandwich.

What truly sets Farrow apart is their commitment to using locally sourced and sustainable ingredients. The quality of their ingredients was evident in every bite, and it made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.

In addition to the delightful food and beverages, the service at Farrow was top-notch. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about their offerings. They took the time to explain the story behind each item and answered all my questions with enthusiasm.

Overall, my experience at Farrow Sandwiches & Coffee was nothing short of exceptional. From the cozy atmosphere to the incredible food and warm service, it truly exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend a visit to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. Farrow has undoubtedly earned its place as one of my favorite spots in town, and I cannot wait to return for more of their delightful sandwiches and coffee.

"Let's just start with the best; the chicken noodle soup here is very good. I ordered this several times and it's easily one of the best things I've eaten lately.  The broth is clear and savory, the chicken and vegetables are tender and I don't even know.. you should just order it. 

Egg salad sandwiches, ham and cheese and beef sandwiches all came on fresh baked, fluffy breads. I love how everything here is fresh made in house. In hindsight I should've ordered something with corned beef or pastrami because duh -NY deli.., but these other items all made me plenty happy. 

Somehow I ended up with a free slice of cheesecake (thanks, Mr awesome waiter!) which was stupid good. I don't know what they do to this, I swear it has to be a 50/50 cheese and heavy whipping cream mixture.., it's so rich, yet fluffy and very vanilla-y. 

You should get the soup in a semi healthy move and then mess it all up by getting the cheese cake right after. It's cool, because after all lunch was light (and I said so).",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"In the heart of a bustling neighborhood sits Tin Roof Tacos, a gem of culinary excellence that's redefining the taco experience. Upon entry, the vibrant ambiance is palpable, with upbeat music that sets a lively tone. The service is impeccable; staff are not only attentive but passionate about their offerings, and their recommendations are spot on.

Navigating the menu is an adventure in itself – filled with an innovative twist on classic tacos that tantalize the taste buds. Each taco, a harmonious combination of flavors and textures, is crafted with fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. A standout is the carne asada taco, with its tender, marinated beef, and the fish taco, a crispy yet succulent delight that's both refreshing and satisfying.

Equally impressive are the house-made salsas, each elevating the tacos to new heights. The spicy mango salsa is a particular highlight, a perfect companion to the zesty crunch of the tacos. Moreover, Tin Roof Tacos strikes a fine balance in portion sizes – satisfying without being overwhelming.

The restaurant itself exudes a rustic charm with its namesake tin roof and warm, inviting decor. It's a space that feels both contemporary and cozy, making it ideal for casual lunches or lively dinners with friends.

In conclusion, my experience at Tin Roof Tacos was exceptional. It's not just about the food, which is exceptional, but the overall atmosphere and service that create a memorable dining adventure. I have no qualms in awarding Tin Roof Tacos a well-deserved five-star rating. This place is a must-visit for any taco aficionado or anyone seeking a vibrant dining experience with a touch of authenticity.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Gainbridge Fieldhouse is a fantastic dining experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm and friendly service. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, making excellent recommendations.

The ambiance of the restaurant was modern and chic. I loved the sleek decor and comfortable seating. It was the perfect setting for a night out with friends or a special occasion.

Now let's talk about the food. The menu had a diverse selection of options, catering to all tastes. I started with the crispy calamari, which was cooked to perfection. The breading was light and crispy, and the calamari itself was tender and flavorful.

For my main course, I went with the grilled salmon. It was cooked to perfection, with a beautiful char on the outside and a moist and flaky interior. The accompanying roasted vegetables were deliciously seasoned and the perfect complement to the dish.

I couldn't resist trying the dessert, and I was not disappointed. The chocolate lava cake was rich and decadent, with a gooey center that oozed with every bite. It was the perfect end to a satisfying meal.

"In the heart of New Orleans, the Ruby Slipper Cafe offers a culinary adventure that seamlessly blends traditional Southern flavors with a twist of contemporary flair, beckoning locals and travelers alike. Walking into this charming establishment, I was immediately enveloped by a warm, vibrant atmosphere, a prelude to the exceptional dining experience ahead.

Our server greeted us with genuine Southern hospitality and an enthusiasm for the menu that was infectious. Their knowledge of the dishes, and the eagerness to suggest their favorites, added a personal touch that made our selection process enjoyable.

Every dish that graced our table was a testament to the chef's prowess. The BBQ Shrimp & Grits were a symphony of flavors, the succulent shrimp juxtaposed with smooth, creamy grits tingled the palate. I ventured to taste the Eggs Cochon, a masterpiece of tender, slow-cooked pork, perfectly poached eggs, and a heavenly hollandaise sauce—all nestled atop a flaky biscuit that melted in the mouth.

Their signature Bloody Mary was a delightful concoction, the ideal blend of spice and zest; it's not just a drink but an experience in itself.

The Ruby Slipper isn't just a meal; it's a celebration of New Orleans' spirit.

"This review is only for the Banh Mi Cafe section of the restaurant. 

This restaurant just opened up near my work so I decided to stop in and try one of their Vietnamese Hoagies aka Banh Mi and also an avocado shake. The restaurant looks really nice outside and inside--super contemporary and zen. I didn't have time to sit down and eat so I decided to just go to their take-out section to the far right of the restaurant. It's all in the same space inside but there's a separate entrance and designated counter for the cafe takeouts which is nice.  

I ordered the traditional cold cut Banh Mi which is called Banh Mi Thit Dac Biet on their menu. They actually have 7 varieties of Banh Mi listed which I thought was pretty cool since normally there's only 2 varieties (cold cut or grilled meat). You will see the menu list 8 items in the Banh Mi section but Banh Mi Bo Kho (beef stew served with bread) is not really a sandwich like we expect a Banh Mi to be...so I'm just saying there's really only 7. 

Anyway, back to the sandwich. It was OK. Not the greatest but not horrible. I think the bread could have been fresher, the cucumber cut smaller (the big wedge was hard to eat in the sandwich) and the pickled carrots and daikon a little less sweet. Since they are newly opened, I'll give them a little while to get adjusted. The avocado smoothie was ok too. Nothing spectacular.  I spent $9 for the sandwhich and drink which I thought was a little high, but prices seem to be going up everywhere so that just may be the case. 

 I would definitely like to go back and try their pho and rice dishes. Hopefully I can update my review with another star next time.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I make it a point to come here every other weekend or so. We get up early and set out for a hike at Wissahickon Park with our pup and then enjoy some delicious beers at Wissahickon Brewery. 

There's not much better than beers and puppers. You can expect all the fluff, friendly staff, and tasty beers. Food trucks are also available to help fill your tummy after a nice walk in the park.

And, if you're a ping ponger (like my SO), they've got that for you in the back. 

I'm always trying to find new places to take my dog, and usually they can be seasonal (beer garden, outside seating, etc.), but at Wissahickon Brewery, you can enjoy fun times with your pup ALL YEAR LONG.

"Overall I feel it deserves 3.5 stars, but I went with 4 based on the spiked milkshakes. They have a great variety of pretty inventive concoctions both non-alcoholic milkshakes and then spiked. I wanted to try the Reese's and the Irish, but they were out of both. Apparently they make their flavored infused vodka's in-house and they had run out. Oh well, the nutella one it was, and it was delicious! Couldn't really taste the alcohol, and it most definitely didn't give me any sort of buzz, so I wish they had kicked it up a notch in that dept. 
So thrilled by the milkshake, I was stoked for our entrees. However, the burger, to me, was good, not that great. I went with the Burger Republic burger which was smoked gouda, Benton's bacon (points for that), grilled onions, lettuce, tomato,. Excellent bun, juicy burger- a tad thick, but cooked nicely. It was almost too juicy (aka too much fat in meat) that it just saturated the brioche bun. Don't get me wrong it was very delicious, but I still think the Pharmacy has a superior burger. The truffle tots were a bit overpowering to me- the regular tots tasted better. The tots were nothing fancy, just regular old tater tots. My husband had the farm burger, which he enjoyed. We also tried the Benton's bacon mac & cheese. I am definitely a mac & cheese snob. This was one was a white mac & cheese, not very cheesy (needed more of a sharp cheddar) and it was very milky/runny. It would have been great had it been baked and congealed more. The topping was good, that is where the bacon and crumbly topping came in. Tasty, but not mind-blowing. My kids wouldn't touch it. 
I would rate this in the top 5 burgers in Nashville. I think Pharmacy and Fido come before this place. Definitely a good spot, family friendly. The prices were reasonable, and they also had a great beer selection. I don't think I'd drive this far out again to this location, but I will definitely go back to the Gulch location next time.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Florida Strawberry Festival and let me tell you, it was an experience to remember. From start to finish, this place exceeded my expectations. First, let's talk about the atmosphere. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with vibrant and lively decorations that instantly put me in a festive mood. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home.

Now, let's move on to the star of the show - the food. Oh boy, where do I even begin? The menu was filled with tantalizing options, each more tempting than the last. Being a strawberry lover, I decided to go for the strawberry-inspired dishes, and I'm so glad I did. The Strawberry Pizza was an unexpected delight, with its perfectly crunchy crust layered with a sweet and tangy strawberry sauce, topped with fresh basil and melted cheese. It was a unique combination that truly worked wonders on my taste buds.

Next, I indulged in the Strawberry BBQ Ribs, and let me just say, they were finger-licking good. The meat was tender, cooked to perfection, and generously glazed with a lip-smacking strawberry-infused barbecue sauce. It was a heavenly blend of smoky, sweet, and tangy flavors that left me craving for more.

To end my fantastic meal, I couldn't resist trying the Strawberry Shortcake. The delicate sponge cake, layered with fluffy whipped cream and topped with plump, juicy strawberries, was a dessert lover's dream come true. Every bite was pure bliss, and it left me with the sweetest aftertaste of strawberries.

Lastly, I must mention the attentive and efficient service. The waitstaff was prompt in taking my order and made sure I had everything I needed throughout my meal. Their warm smiles and genuine care for the customers truly made the experience memorable.

In conclusion, the Florida Strawberry Festival is a gem that delivers not only unique and delicious strawberry-infused dishes but also a welcoming and lively ambiance.

"TL:DR - Does the little things well (service, cleanliness, interior design) while having the best desserts in town. Don't over look their cafe menu, easily holds its own in that department.

Wow, this places just continues to impress me. I've been here enough (exclusively for desserts) that I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet, and have tried almost every dessert menu item, and you honestly can't go wrong. But the bread pudding is to die for!

This most recent time I met there with some friends, we all ended up not having had dinner yet, so I have my first experience with their food, and it definitely held its own. While it may not have been the best food I've ever had nor was it as good as Cyrano's desserts, on it's own it is easily above average. I got the curried chicken salad, cuz I'm trying to be healthy n all, and it was surprisingly delicious. Good balance of mayo and curry so that it had good flavor but not overpoweringly mayo heavy. It was quite refreshing and satisfying. I also got the roasted mashed potatoes as a side instead of fries (again... healthy -__-) and those were also really good, even without gravy, to the point that I may just get that going forward.

Beyond the food, the wait staff has always been attentive without being annoying, and friendly without being fake. The style of the interior is a bit older, but it's got personality as my grandma would say. Either way, this has turned from a dessert spot to a more versatile, dessert and more spot.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

We sat at a table next to the window and two of us had a/c condensation dripping on us the whole time. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

"If you've read my reviews you know I don't give many five star ratings. This time I have to go there. This recent meal may have been one of the best we have experienced in Indy. Started with the daily oysters. Don't remember the variety but they were very nice, deep cupped, slightly briny and fresh gems. Our group tried many things and all were very well received. My wife had the Sitka Salmon which, with its included sides, was excellent. At the last minute I decided to try the House Sausage and was very happy with the choice - good snap on the casing and tasty, savory insides. Others in the party had the Filet, the Duck Breast and Pastrami Crusted Squash - and loved them. We ordered one of each side to share - Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta, Tomato Tartine and Yukon Potatoes - excellent! Finished with the Goat Cheese Roulades and Chocolate Mousse Box, both of which were very good. Server did a great job. Our only complaint was that it was really cold in the restaurant. We were told they shared the HVAC with the hotel and there was nothing they could do. That was disappointing because it diminished an otherwise excellent experience.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently dined at the Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Downtown and overall, I had a pleasant experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was inviting, with its modern decor and comfortable seating. The staff greeted me with warm smiles and were attentive throughout the meal.

The menu offered a good variety of options, ranging from appetizers to main courses. I opted for their specialty dish, the grilled salmon, and it did not disappoint. The fish was cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful. The accompanying sides complemented the dish well and added a nice touch to the overall presentation.

The service was prompt, and my server was knowledgeable about the menu, making helpful recommendations. The food arrived in a timely manner, and I appreciated that the staff checked in on me periodically, ensuring that I had everything I needed.

While my dining experience was enjoyable, there were a few areas for improvement. The portion size of the dish was a bit smaller than expected, considering the price. Additionally, the dessert options were limited and lacked variety. It would have been nice to see some unique and indulgent choices.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the restaurant at Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Downtown delivered quality food and exceptional service. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the staff went above and beyond to make my dining experience pleasant. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal in the downtown area.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"Located across from Belmont and the (original and current) home of the 'nun bun,' Bongo Java is a great place to grab a latte.  They've got a nice listing of specialty beverages and of course can make you anything that you invent.  Food is very similar to Fido (same company), so I'm quite a fan of the muffins and baked goods.  Haven't actually eaten any of the hot food at this establishment.  

Crowd tends to be eclectic...tatoos and Toms to college students in sweatpants taking up a lot of table space and studying.  The inside area isn't huge and sometimes it's difficult to get a seat.  Bongo Java has a most excellent porch/patio though, so it's nice to sit outside on pretty days and people watch.  There is also a small theatre upstairs, I actually went to an improv comedy show here once that was super fun, so that's something else to check out if you hear of an event happening.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"It is fitting that my 100th review would be the epic tasting menu at Serpico. We opted for the 9 course tasting menu because we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday, and also because YOLO. It's necessary to note that prices are very high, so take that into account when dining at Serpico. Now, onto the food...

I had been anticipating this dinner for weeks and was dutifully reading the reviews, so was surprised to not be as turned off as the masses were with the rice cracker starter. We ordered the Old Fashioned and Aviation, both interesting and strong, and settled in at the chef's counter for the 9 courses to come. Courses and feelings listed below.

Pigs tongue on top of sticky rice- perfect little morsel: 4.5
Razor Clams- light and refreshing: 4
Raw Scallops in Buttermilk- buttery and interesting: 3.5
Soft poached egg with mushrooms and smoked eel- melt in your mouth: 4
Beef Consomme- great broth and flavor from caramelized onions: 4.5
Deep Fried Duck Leg (a very necessary a la carte addition)- OMG THAT GOOD: 5
Cope's Corn Ravioli- intense corn flavor and great smokiness from chorizo: 4.5
Caper Brined Trout- cooked perfectly and tasty, but least favorite: 3
Lamb Ribs- sweet, sticky, delicious: 5
Frozen Foie Gras, Peanut Brittle, Grape Sorbet- not sold on this one: 3
Rocky Road- great end to the meal, rich chocolate, marshmallow, candied walnuts: 4.5

So to sum it up, Serpico is delicious and inventive and we left stuffed. Service is great, and atmosphere is casual and cool. I loved watching the chefs prepare the dishes, and was impressed that Peter Serpico was in the kitchen on a Tuesday night. The tasting menu was a great experience, but only recommend if you have $$$$ to spend and a belly to fill. Otherwise, all our favorite courses were on the regular menu.

"A very nice Valentine's day surprise! My special someone reserved for the early seating - a perfect time of day too! The beautiful light coming through the windows really was warm and gave the room lovely ambiance.  The candles - yes real flame candles and the sparkly twig lights in the bower overhead by the fireplace, replete with rappellers. Ok, they were sculpture, but what a whimsical idea that matched the theme of the stone fireplace with a really interesting inlaid tree design.

The 3 course set menu for Valentine's day was *almost* all gluten free - only the crab cakes were not gluten free.  The menu choices were really all fantastic options - we loved every one of them. It was so nice to be able to share the dishes - because they all looked so good! :)

We started by ordering wine...by the glass so we could try different things. :) One of our wine choices was unfortunately unavailable, and they substituted a more expensive wine. And it turns out, it was phenomenal! We ended up ordering a couple more glasses!

Our menu choices began with the risotto for me, and the carpaccio for him. Oh my. BOTH were fantastic choices! The risotto was perfectly done, flavours balanced, and a decent sized portion.  The carpaccio - every single element was delicious.  I could have eaten just that dish alllll night.  The mustards, the crisps, and that beef! 

Next we ordered the beef and duck. I would have ordered the fish, but the duck was lovely! The beef was almost baseball sized, and tender! Cooked to perfect doneness, and we couldn't stop eating - there were no crumbs left on the plate. And no, I did not lick it, (you know me too well!) the fork was an excellent tool to get every last bit.

For dessert we shared the most amazing, and enormous, plate of chocolate. Indulgence indeed.  Both major components were amazing. Plus, add sponge toffee, and I'm all over that.  The fruit was juicy and ripe - raspberries! Sorbet was great and we wrestled a little to make sure I got my fair share. I would order that again in a heartbeat.

We felt unhurried, although we were aware there was another seating after us, we didn't feel crowded or that there was an imminent need for the table.

I am looking forward to my next visit. And the visit after that.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"ive been to many good spin classes but unfortunately ive been to many bad bad boring classes which just feel like a waste of time.  the two classes here so far have been great; i love this studio!  the instructors are fun and offer a great (difficult and heart-pounding/but not deathly) workout! what i really like about this studio: 

1. the bikes here are so new and nice!!! the bikes are so smooth and i love that all bikes have individual screens to track your exact gear (no more big knob in the middle) and how fast youre going. the time on the screen also gives you a sense of when you can start counting down to the end of the class when you are dying :D

2. its a very nice, clean studio.  its super close to my apartment and right by a cvs if you need a lot of water very very immediately. 

3. online registration ensures you get a spot in the class! such a wonderful/time efficient system!

4. the towels also smell slighly sweet, which i like. nothing offensive or too strong, but a very subtle smell :)

it would be nice if they had a water fountain and turned up the music a little louder (perhaps the instructors can use mikes?).  all in all, i definitely recommend this studio for anyone interested in spin classes. the first class is free! and all the other classes are reasonable, especially for students!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Vesuvio Restaurant & Bar, and I can confidently say it was a delightful experience from start to finish. With its cozy atmosphere and impeccable service, this restaurant easily earns a well-deserved 5-star rating.

Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by friendly and attentive staff members who made me feel right at home. The cozy and inviting ambiance added to the warmth of the place, making it the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or a casual get-together with friends.

The menu at Vesuvio Restaurant & Bar offers a wide variety of Italian dishes, and each one is prepared with the utmost care and attention to detail. The flavors were simply outstanding! Every bite was bursting with freshness and expertly balanced seasonings.

I started my meal with the Caprese salad. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and juicy, and the mozzarella was creamy and flavorful. For the main course, I couldn't resist trying their homemade pasta dish, the Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Shrimp. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was rich and creamy without being overwhelming. The shrimp were succulent and added a delightful touch to the dish.

To complete my dining experience, I indulged in one of their decadent desserts - the Tiramisu. It was heavenly! The delicate layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee liqueur and topped with creamy mascarpone cheese were absolutely divine. It was the perfect ending to an already outstanding meal.

What truly sets Vesuvio apart from other restaurants is the exceptional service provided by the staff. The waiters were friendly, knowledgeable, and always ready to assist with any inquiries or recommendations. The attention to detail and genuine hospitality enhanced the overall dining experience and made me feel like a valued guest.

Vesuvio Restaurant & Bar is a hidden gem that exemplifies the essence of Italian cuisine and hospitality.

"We went here on our last night -- a Thursday night during Jazz Fest. We wanted to say goodbye to NOLA properly so we went to Frenchmen. My friend asked if I liked reggae, which of course I do. He then led the way to Blue Nile.

It was very crowded. A Marsalis was performing downstairs so the dancing was upstairs (didn't really catch the name because of the crowd). When we finally got in, that place was packed. As in is-that-my-or-the-person-beside-me's-sweat-on-my-skin kind of packed. The music was enervating, though. Pulsing and energetic that it just gets into your system regardless of if you want it to or not. It was great!

I am not a fan of someone else's sweat being on my skin, nor was I a fan of the pervading cigarette smoke and noxious smell of weed. So when I saw an opening to the balcony, I immediately tried to make my way to it. Clearer air! Success!

"Hidden gem.  Unimpressive entrance in a strip near the Tucson mall.  Very brief menu, but what they have is killer.  I wouldn't call it ""authentic"", as I've never seen corn in Dan Dan noodles before, but I ain't complainin'.
We ordered one spicy dish (dan dan) and one not so spicy (Beijing noodles) just to calibrate our heat levels.  I ate most of the Beijing noodles which have a delicious flavor, heavy on the soy if you like that, and almost no heat.  Good stuff.  My wife ordered the Dan Dan, and was raving about them for hours - ""best I've had""...
Next time I go (and it can't happen too soon) I want to order some of the deep-fried dishes: chicken chop, fish ball, etc.  The noodles are great, but the meal needed some textural variety.
Ordering is typical fast-casual: order and pay at the counter and they bring your meal out.  We had a late lunch, but there were several other tables being served, and our meal came in about 10 minutes which is pretty good.
The lady behind the counter didn't speak much English - we just pointed to what we wanted on the menu.  We asked to dampen the heat level a bit on the Dan Dan, but couldn't get through.
This place might not be for everyone, but if spicy noodles are your kick, Mian is tough to beat.

Moving on to the food, it was mediocre at best. I ordered their famous burger, but unfortunately, it was dry and tasteless. The fries were soggy and lacked proper seasoning. It was truly underwhelming, especially considering the prices they charge.

As for the drinks, they were nothing to write home about either. The bartender seemed more interested in chatting with fellow staff members than taking our orders. The cocktails were generic and lacked creativity. It was clear that the focus here was not on crafting unique and delicious drinks.

The overall atmosphere at Good Friends Bar was lackluster. The crowd was small and it felt like a place that had seen better days. The music was far too loud, making it difficult to have a conversation with my dining companions.

The service was equally as dismal. The staff seemed disinterested and unprofessional, providing little assistance and barely acknowledging my presence. It took an unnecessarily long time for my food to arrive, and when it did, it was underwhelming to say the least.

The menu offered a limited selection of unappetizing options. The dish I ordered was bland and poorly prepared, lacking any flavor or creativity. The presentation was sloppy, with little effort put into making it visually appealing.

      We started our meal with s couple of appetizers. The house made meatballs with fresh mozzarella were tasty and well made, not heavy and the accompanying mozzarella was creamy and fresh. The oven toasted bread had a nice smokey taste. The house meat and cheese plate was outstanding, and at $15 a bargain considering the ingredients. Black truffle cheese, Gorgonzola, parmigiano, salami and prosciutto (which was not on the plate when served) but was quickly provided when by the server when we mentioned it. Kalamata olives, king walnuts sliced apples and more of that wood fired bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Everything on the plate was delicious 
       I should mention that for some reason they had a shortage of forks during our visit  we had to ask for our meal and again with dessert. The Burrata was super creamy and the accompanying arugula with roasted bell peppers was fresh and tasty. 
       Our pizzas were well made, we had a Margarita and a Bianca the cheese on both was plentiful and both were delicious but I would have liked the dough a bit more cooked. 
         We shared the signature Nutella Calzone with Fresh Berries. Nice and sweet. The vanilla gelato was creamy with a strong vanilla flavor. They have a nice selection of Italian coffee. If you want soda they have self serve all you can drink. 
          Will certainly come back to try some other appetizers,salads and pizzas.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Dining at NECTAR is nothing short of a celestial experience. As soon as you step into the welcoming embrace of its contemporary yet intimate ambiance, the allure of its refined decor sets a promising stage for the evening. Service here is impeccable - attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable staff guide your culinary journey with genuine warmth and expert recommendations.

The menu is a testament to gastronomic artistry, offering a plethora of innovative dishes that are as delightful on the palate as they are to the eye. Each bite is a revelation, with flavors that dance and meld together in a symphony of taste. The chef's dedication to utilizing fresh, high-quality ingredients shines through in every dish, ensuring a meal that is both indulgent and elevating.

Highlight of the night was the chef's special - a creation that masterfully balanced bold flavors with delicate textures. Paired with a hand-selected wine from their extensive and well-curated list, the dining experience was harmonious and unforgettable.

From the amuse-bouche to the exquisite dessert, the entire meal was an uninterrupted flow of culinary excellence. NECTAR truly stands out as a gem in the restaurant scene, not just for the food, but for its holistic approach to dining where every detail is considered and perfected. Definitely a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable and top-tier dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Upon arrival at The Container Store, my expectations, piqued by the quirky name suggesting a fusion of utility and gastronomy, were met with utter disappointment. This venture into the dining scene had, as it turned out, nothing to do with its homeware namesake, yet it failed to deliver even the basic tenets of what one might consider a one-star culinary experience, let alone five.

The ambiance was the first red flag: a jumbled mash-up of themes that seemed more akin to a storage facility than a dining venue. Stark lighting cast unappealing shadows across bare tables, while disorganized decor gave the impression of dining amid unpacked boxes rather than intentional design.

Service was as scattered as the aesthetics. Staff fumbled awkwardly with menus that appeared to be as confusing to them as they were to us. Once orders were finally taken, the waiting game began. Time ticked by, suffused with the dull clangor of an unharmonious kitchen, punctuating the backdrop of dissatisfaction among the patrons.

When the food eventually arrived, it was as lackluster as the atmosphere. The flavors, much like the name, were puzzling and nondescript. My dish, a befuddling concoction that straddled the line between imitation avant-garde and uninspired cafeteria fare, was neither memorable nor satisfying. Accompaniments seemed to have been chosen at random, adding neither contrast nor complement to the main.

To add insult to injury, upon receiving the bill, it became apparent that The Container Store's pricing strategy was as muddled as its thrust. High costs usually indicate a premium experience or exceptional cuisine, neither of which were present here.

The only consistent theme at The Container Store was confusion, a sad hallmark of the establishment. As a reviewer, I urge potential diners to consider alternative locales where their time and taste buds are valued. This is one container that unfortunately cannot be recommended for storage of pleasant dining memories.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review 2: The Kettle Black is a fantastic brunch spot that exceeded all of my expectations. Despite being incredibly busy, the staff managed to maintain a high level of service and efficiency. The line may have been long, but it was worth the wait.

Their black bagels are truly unique and absolutely delicious. I tried the black everything bagel with cream cheese, lox, and tomatoes, as well as the black salt bagel with cream cheese. Both were bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The combination of the black bagels and fresh ingredients was a winning combination.

The bakery also offers a wide range of other carb options, including different loaves, baguettes, and pastries. I couldn't resist trying some of their croissants, chocolate croissants, Kouign-amanns, and cinnamon buns. Each bite was heavenly and showcased the skill and passion of the bakers.

To accompany my meal, I ordered one of their coffee drinks and it was exceptional. However, due to the popularity of the bakery, finding a comfortable seat was a challenge. I can't wait to come back during a less busy time so that I can enjoy a leisurely cup of joe in their cozy ambiance.

Overall, my experience at The Kettle Black was outstanding. The food, service, and atmosphere all contributed to a memorable brunch. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in search of a delicious and unique dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

I thought it would be nice to visit my husband for lunch, and bring him tacos on Tuesday. I called ahead, and they quickly took my order. They were sure to confirm it, and everything was perfect since they did. I opted to use the drive-through rather than come in, and the service was so fast.

"Review:
I recently dined at Bern's Steak House and had a fantastic experience. The atmosphere was busy and noisy, not exactly what I expected for a romantic evening, but it didn't dampen our enjoyment. Unfortunately, some obnoxious drunk guests made it a bit unpleasant for a while, but aside from that, everything was great.

The wine selection was extensive, and our server helped me choose a bottle that I absolutely loved. We started with the Pork belly appetizer and Truffle Tartare, both of which were heavenly. The entrees came with a soup, salad, potato, onion straws, and vegetables, which was a lot of food. The French Onion soup was the best I've ever had, and the Chateaubriand steak we shared was amazing.

Before dessert, we took a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar, which was a unique experience. The dessert room was my favorite part with its intimate and romantic setting. I indulged in the macadamia sundae, and it was splendid.

Despite what people say about Bern's being expensive, it's comparable to other high-end restaurants in town, especially if you skip on cocktails. Overall, our experience was wonderful, except for the disruptive loud guest. If you're looking for a special dining experience, I highly recommend Bern's Steak House.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Amazing brunch! Went with some friends, so we got to try a lot of different things.

Appetizers: smoked fish deviled eggs, donuts, huge pancake - I loved them all!

For my main course, I got a dish that featured local summer vegetables four ways. I was blown away. I think my favorite was a soupy grits dish that had mushrooms and a poached egg in it. There were also various salads with fresh veggies that mostly came from their garden.

Honestly everything on the menu looked excellent. I tried my friends' country fried steak and fried bologna eggs Benedict, and I would eat them again.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Also, there is a firearms/weapons history collection located on premise that is free and rivals any collection I have ever seen. It was a private collection that was donated to be shown.

"Came here for Brunch on their grand opening and overall I'd give it a 4.5, no one is perfect on opening day but they sure were close!

This place is a total vibe, from the greeters to the overall staff. You can choose to sit on either side, one is a more casual diner style setting, where you can view the chefs preparing your food and the other is a more upscale yet comfortable club like setting that shows the versatility of this location. 

The food was AMAZING. The names will get you if nothing else but once you taste the flavors you're hooked. I ordered the shrimp and grits better known as ""Everyday People"" its a good portion but I'm a southern girl and enjoy a little more grits. It's advertised to offer 4 gulf shrimp but me and my friend both received 5 so I can't complain. Other options ordered throughout the table include the ""Peaches & Cream"" and the ""Before I Let Go."" No complaints on either ends. I tasted the french toast and couldn't either. We also ordered the fried macaroni and cheese balls aka ""Love Galore"" and they are the best I've had. They also aren't heavy as most places are so you can eat them and still enjoy your meal. There was a little wait but again, this was the grand opening so it could be expected. Our waiter Chrissy was very engaged and constantly communicated with us so that helped. 

As far as the bottomless goes, there's no brunch without it really. However, they offer the champagne bottle for $27 and 2 juice options! That's honestly a better option when you come with a larger party. This a great place for whatever brunch level you're trying to achieve. I cant wait to try it for dinner.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Review: My experience at Marie Gabriel Couture Bridal was fantastic, earning it a 4-star rating. From the moment I stepped into the store, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism. The showroom itself is absolutely beautiful, creating a luxurious and high-end atmosphere.

I had the pleasure of working with Celeste, who made the entire dress selection process enjoyable and stress-free. Despite calling last minute, the staff was incredibly accommodating and made time for me. Celeste took the time to listen to my preferences and understand the vision I had for my wedding dress. She asked for photos I had saved, which helped her get a better sense of what I was looking for.

Celeste guided me through the store, showing me different designs and taking my feedback into consideration. She pulled a wide variety of gowns for me to try on, and based on my reactions, she continued to narrow down the options. It was evident that she had an expert knowledge of bridal gowns and knew exactly what would suit my style.

Ultimately, with Celeste's help, I found my dream gown. Her attention to detail and understanding of my preferences were crucial in making the right choice. Celeste's friendly and patient demeanor made the experience even more enjoyable.

The only reason I didn't give a perfect 5-star rating is because the prices at Marie Gabriel Couture Bridal are on the higher side. While they offer a luxurious experience and high-quality dresses, it may not be within everyone's budget. However, if you're willing to invest in a stunning dress and personalized service, Marie Gabriel Couture Bridal is definitely worth considering.

Overall, my experience at Marie Gabriel Couture Bridal was exceptional. The staff was welcoming and accommodating, the showroom was beautiful, and Celeste's assistance was invaluable. I highly recommend this bridal boutique to anyone in search of their dream wedding dress.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Favorite part about this place: on a Sunday afternoon when brunch rezzys are hard, this place makes it easy to get some good food without waiting forever. The main reason is because you pay for your food at the counter and then you seat yourself, but the somehow maintain their vibe as a ""nice brunch sit down"". On top of that- great brunch drinks!

I got the falafel sandwich and it was pretty good. A little dry but they offer hot sauce which made a huge difference! The sandwiches had a little too much cilantro, it overpowered the taste a little (I was told it's the same with the other sandwiches too). The flatbreads looked pretty good too but didn't have enough room to try them this time. Great location and vibe overall!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Impeccable service, a library-esque ambiance, and whispered conversations about favorite chapters created a refuge for foodies and bibliophiles alike.

"From the moment I stepped into Serranos Salsa Co., I was enveloped in a waft of intoxicating aromas that promised a feast for the senses. The vibrant, buzzy ambiance struck a perfect balance between cozy and chic, setting the stage for what turned out to be an exceptional dining experience.

A basket of warm, house-made tortilla chips and a trio of fresh salsas landed on our table almost immediately. Each salsa boasted its own unique flavor profile, from a smoky chipotle to a tangy tomatillo and a fiery habanero. As we tempted our taste buds with these zesty starters, it was clear that Serranos takes its name and its salsas seriously.

The menu, an impressive mosaic of traditional and contemporary Mexican cuisine, offered an array of tempting choices. I opted for the signature dish, a beautifully plated carne asada that was the perfect synthesis of mouth-watering flavours and tender, expertly grilled steak. Accompanied by savory black beans and fluffy cilantro-lime rice, every bite was a testament to the kitchen's dedication to quality and technique.

Service at Serranos was nothing short of impeccable. Attentive without being intrusive, the staff pivoted around the dining room with grace and professionalism, ensuring that glasses were filled, and every need was met with a smile.

Onto dessert, and the churros—crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and dusted with cinnamon sugar—were a divine end to an already sublime meal. Paired with a velvety chocolate dipping sauce, it was the kind of sweet treat that echoes in your memory long after the last bite.

Serranos Salsa Co. is a gem that shines brightly in a sea of dining options, weaving together the essence of Mexican cuisine with a dash of culinary artistry. My 5-star experience there was a delightful journey for my palate, and a reminder of how exquisite and heartwarming good food, when shared with good company in a great restaurant, can truly be.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Loved this spot. Such a cool concept with the beach vibes, the variety in tacos, the order cards, and great drink options. Guacamole was terrific and had some heat to it. We tried about 6-8 different tacos and each was absolutely delicious. Their definitely on the smaller side, but what they lack in size they definitely make up for in flavor. My advice would be to order 4-6 per person if it's going to be a dinner, or if you're with your significant other order every single one you're interested in and split each one so you can try them all. I know we didn't find one that we didn't like. Also, the sangria is great too, just pricy. Price of sangria and size of the tacos would probably be my only real critique of this place. And I just found out there's one 20 mins from my house in PA, so I can't wait to get over to that one soon!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Great fishing pier complete with snack bar. No license is required to fish from the pier (but I think this is true of most shore fishing in the gulf). The only surprise was that the Egmont Key Ferry no longer leaves from this location. I suspect this is in response to the $5 (per car) entry fee collected to enter Fort De Soto (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fort-de-soto-park-tierra-verde). 

If you are looking for the ferry, it now leaves from the boat ramps, which are before the campground and before the park entrance (which has been moved further south).

PS. The location on the map is a bit off. The pier is to the west of the bayway, not east. When you get to the intersection, turn right (toward the North Beach), not left. It will be about a mile further along on your left.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Downtown Comics West offers a unique dining experience that seamlessly blends delicious food with the vibrant world of comics. I recently had the pleasure of dining here, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed.

The restaurant's ambience is a treat for any comic book lover. The walls adorned with colorful posters and comic book art create an immersive and fun atmosphere. As I sat down, I couldn't help but notice the attention to detail in every corner, from the comic book-themed table settings to the well-curated display of comic books throughout the space.

The menu is equally impressive, offering a range of creative dishes that cater to all tastes. I opted for the ""Superhero Burger,"" a mouthwatering combination of juicy beef, crispy bacon, and creamy melted cheese. The flavors were balanced perfectly, and the burger was cooked to perfection. The side of sweet potato fries was a delightful twist, adding a touch of sweetness to the meal.

The service at Downtown Comics West was also commendable. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure that all my needs were met. They were knowledgeable about the menu and comic book culture, enthusiastically engaging in conversations and recommending dishes.

I did, however, deduct one star from my rating due to the slightly higher prices compared to other restaurants in the area. While the quality of the food and experience justifies it to an extent, it may not be accessible to everyone on a regular basis.

Overall, my experience at Downtown Comics West was a delight. It truly brought out the inner comic book fan in me while serving up tasty food. Whether you're a die-hard comic book aficionado or simply looking for a unique dining experience, I highly recommend giving Downtown Comics West a try.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

Their coffee selection is amazing, with a variety of brews from different regions around the world. I opted for their signature house blend, and it did not disappoint. The rich, bold flavor was the perfect pick-me-up to start my day.

"Upon entering Rival Bros Coffee, the warm aroma of freshly ground beans was an instant invitation to indulge in a coffee experience like no other. The baristas greeted me with infectious enthusiasm, setting a welcoming tone for my visit.

The ambiance of the café struck a perfect balance between modern industrial chic and cozy nook. I nestled into a comfortable seat near the window, with sunlight dappling through, creating a serene spot for both contemplation and conversation.

I scanned the menu, which offered an array of classic and innovative caffeine concoctions. Deciding on a single-origin pour-over, I watched as the barista meticulously brewed the coffee with expert precision. The result was a cup that sang with complexity, boasting notes of chocolate and a hint of citrus acidity, yet smoothly rounded without a hint of bitterness.

Pairing my coffee with a delectably buttery croissant, baked to flaky perfection, I savored the combination of flavors and textures. It was evident that Rival Bros Coffee is passionate not only about their coffee but also about the quality of their pastries.

Throughout my visit, the staff demonstrated an admirable level of expertise, recommending brews and offering insights into their coffee selection. Such attentiveness made the experience educational as well as enjoyable.

As I departed, the contented buzz of satisfied customers and clinking coffee cups lingered in my ears.

It's a benchmark for coffee culture in the city, and I look forward to my next visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Review: 
I had an extremely disappointing experience at Tortilla Press and would not recommend it to anyone. From the moment I walked in, I knew it was going to be a letdown. The atmosphere was lackluster, with outdated decor and an overall dingy feel.

The service was just as mediocre as the ambiance. Our server seemed disinterested and unattentive, rarely checking on us or refilling our drinks. It took forever for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and poorly prepared.

I decided to try their famous tacos, and they were a complete disappointment. The tortillas were dry and tasteless, and the meat was overcooked and flavorless. The toppings were sparse and lacked freshness. It was clear that little care had been taken in the preparation of the food.

To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant for the poor quality of the food. I felt like I was being ripped off for the subpar meal I received. I have had better Mexican food at a fast-food chain for half the price.

Overall, my experience at Tortilla Press was a complete disaster. From the lackluster atmosphere to the mediocre service and the terrible food, there was nothing redeeming about this restaurant. I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money here.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

My experience at Frothy Monkey was average. The restaurant had a trendy and cozy atmosphere, which was inviting. The staff was friendly and accommodating, making me feel welcomed.

I started my meal with a cappuccino, which was decent. However, it wasn't as smooth and flavorful as I had hoped. The latte art was a nice touch though. For brunch, I ordered the avocado toast, which was a disappointment. The toast was too dry, and the avocado lacked flavor. The addition of some seasoning or a sauce could have really elevated the dish.

On a positive note, my partner ordered the chicken and waffles, and their dish was much better than mine. The chicken was perfectly crispy, and the waffles were fluffy. The combination of sweet and savory flavors was well-balanced, and they enjoyed every bite. It left me wishing I had ordered something different.

Although the food was hit or miss, the service was attentive. Our server checked on us regularly and promptly refilled our drinks. The seating was comfortable, and the noise level was moderate, allowing for easy conversation.

In terms of value, Frothy Monkey is on the pricier side for what you get. While it is understandable that trendy restaurants often have higher prices, I expected more in terms of taste and quality.

Overall, Frothy Monkey is a decent spot for a casual meal. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again. There are other options in the area that offer better food and value for money.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"It's been awhile since my last visit to Million Thai. If they weren't located so far east, I'd be here more often but what can you do. East side residents, come here.

Closed Tuesday's like (almost) every other Asian restaurant. Happy to see they still have the lunch menu available and it's pretty much stayed the same price. Lunch deal still good!

The regular menu. So many options to choose from but that's typical. The combination dinners used to be a really good deal (last year, it was $30.00 for combo A, $35.00 for combo B and $65.00 for combo C). Still a fairly decent deal but it's annoying that they won't let you do any substitutions.

We went with the dinner for two set A combination ($37.00) where you get a starter, curry, stir fry and rice.

- Thai iced lemon tea and Thai iced milk tea ($3.50 each)
- Money bags 
- Pad thai ($15.00) 
- Penang curry
- Pong ka ree
- Coconut rice

"Embarking on a culinary journey to Mikado Japanese was an unforgettable experience that deserves a standing ovation – a full, resounding five stars. Upon entering Mikado, the immediate impression was one of serene elegance: the decor blending traditional Japanese aesthetics with a modern flair, creating an environment that felt both authentic and contemporary.

Greeted by a warm and inviting staff, we were promptly seated and handed menus that promised a tantalizing selection of traditional Japanese fare. The Sake list was extensive and included both familiar and exclusive options, demonstrating a commitment to provide a well-rounded dining experience.

One cannot embark on the Mikado experience without indulging in their sushi offerings – each piece a testament to the chef's artistry and attention to detail. The fish, fresh and succulent, seemed to have jumped from the sea straight onto our beautifully garnished platters. The Chef’s Special Roll was a masterpiece, fusing textures and flavors in a delightful dance that had our taste buds in an ecstatic tango.

But sushi was only the beginning. The tempura was another highlight, with a light, crisp batter that enrobed succulent shrimp and vegetables without a hint of oiliness. It was a true study in contrast and balance that only a master could achieve. As for the main course, the Teppanyaki was a show in itself, expertly prepared at our table with a flair that animated the senses well before the first bite was savored.

Even the desserts were standouts, from the matcha ice cream with its rich, earthy undertones to the delicate sweetness of the mochi.

Service matched the quality of food – attentive yet unobtrusive, with recommendations offered at just the right moment. The staff displayed an in-depth knowledge of both the menu and sake pairings, which greatly enriched our dining experience.

It is a large serving, but I do think $10 for overnight oats is a little pricey, and some of their menu items are a little pricey for what you get, which is why I gave 4 stars. Overall, I would come back for many of their other options, and definitely their mimosas!!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Not only are selections carefully made for you, but you are also encouraged to point to anything in the shop and ask to try it.

"My experience at Vip City Tours was, to put it mildly, disappointing. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with an air of indifference from the staff. No warm smiles, no friendly dialogue - just an aloofness that left a bad taste in my mouth even before I had the chance to taste the food.

Speaking of the food, it was a major letdown. The menu boasted a variety of options, but the execution fell flat. The dishes lacked creativity and finesse, and the flavors were bland and uninspiring. I had high hopes for the seafood pasta, but it was a soggy, overcooked mess that left me longing for more.

The service was equally subpar. Despite the restaurant being less than half full, it felt like I was constantly waiting for the waitstaff to attend to me. Their lack of attentiveness was frustrating, and it seemed like they were more interested in chatting amongst themselves than providing a satisfactory dining experience.

To make matters worse, the ambiance was lacking. The restaurant had a generic, cookie-cutter interior that did nothing to enhance the dining experience. The noise level was also quite high, making it difficult to have a conversation without straining to hear each other.

Though I was excited to try Vip City Tours based on the promising reviews I had read, my overall experience fell far short of expectations. It's unfortunate that such a potentially great establishment misses the mark in so many areas. With a lackluster menu, indifferent service, and uninspiring ambiance, I won't be returning to Vip City Tours anytime soon.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

I really like any of their chocolate or nuts flavors here, pistachio being my favorite.  I do not recommend the fruit flavors.  While I love fruit, their flavors are boring to me, I find myself throwing away the cup after a few bites and not being able to finish even the small size.  

The only strong flavor that I have tasted here is the lemon.  Everything else is fairly smooth.  I really wish that they had more interesting flavors.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

They also have a great view of the skyline from their patio. The environment is chill if you're there to just hang out, read a book, or meet friends, but they also have a tv that you can watch sports on. 

My favorite beer is there coffee porter. It's like drinking an iced coffee and getting a buzz. The service is always pretty good. They don't serve food, but you can bring food in. And, they have dog treats for the four legged friends.

"Came in last Saturday with a few friends. Were quickly seated and our server Serena was fantastic! My husband and I ordered fish tacos. The flavor was okay, but very little fish. Considering the tacos were $11 per 2, I would've expected more fish. It was a lot of cheese and lettuce...



Not the one to leave negative reviews, but our visit left us very disappointed in this new place... My husband and I came in with our two pups. All we wanted was a beer and something to nibble on while enjoying the beautiful (and windy) day out.  We went upstairs and were quickly seated. Our bud light drafts arrived promptly as well. Unfortunately we also ordered their fish spread which we had to cancel after it never arrived after 30 min wait. Our server (given she was the only one on the floor) has not checked in with us after we placed our orders. My husband (who had to chase her down to pay), said she ""was aloof and grumpy"". Our bud lights were not $2 as advertised. We got charged $6.42 (after tax) instead. We didn't question or argued. The server was very annoyed when we refused to pay for the spread and didn't want to take it to go.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"8p drop in on a Friday night and ample seating on the patio. Perfect night, so opted for seating outside. Started with Salsa and Guacamole with chips, which is $5.25, not complimentary. Unsure if you get refills or not.  Salsa had a really great flavor. It's not a chunky salsa, but definitely enjoyable. The guacamole was pretty good, again, not a chunky version, but very fresh.
Club Tots, hold the easy egg please. Tots were great! Cooked perfectly in-between crispy and mushy, which is right where I like mine. Nice flavor on the queso and comparable price at $5 for the portion.
So many tacos to choose from, but I settled on the Atomic Chicken. Of course the name would have you believe unbearable heat, but alas, it was bearable. Yes, it was spicy and the gorgonzola cheese was a wonderful compliment to the taco. Tacos are a la cart style, so I ordered another one of them. 
This restaurant is a fan of Milagro tequila, which isn't my fav, but the Margarita was enjoyable. Didn't need 2 of these.

"I recently had the unfortunate pleasure of dining at Kon Tiki Restaurant & Lounge and I must say, it was a complete disappointment. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was lackluster and outdated. The service was abysmal, with wait staff appearing disinterested and slow to attend to our needs. 

As for the food, it was nothing short of awful. The menu boasted a variety of dishes, but each one seemed to fall short in terms of flavor and presentation. The ingredients tasted stale and lacked any freshness. I ordered the seafood platter and was greeted with rubbery shrimp and bland scallops. It was clear that no care was taken in preparing the dishes.

To make matters worse, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of food and service provided. It felt like a complete rip-off. 

Overall, my experience at Kon Tiki Restaurant & Lounge was a major disappointment. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a quality dining experience.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Thanal Indian Tavern and I must say, it was an extraordinary experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the friendly staff who made us feel right at home.

The ambiance of the restaurant was stunning, with beautiful Indian decor and soft lighting creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The seating was comfortable and the tables were perfectly spaced for a private dining experience.

Now, let's talk about the food. Oh my goodness, where do I even begin? The menu at Thanal Indian Tavern is a culinary delight, offering a wide range of traditional Indian dishes that will satisfy any craving. We started with the crispy samosas which were filled with perfectly spiced potatoes and peas. The flavors were incredible and left us wanting more.

For our main course, we tried the butter chicken and the lamb biryani. Both dishes were cooked to perfection, with tender meat and rich, aromatic sauces that were bursting with flavor. The spices were well-balanced, allowing the true taste of the ingredients to shine through.

To complete our meal, we indulged in the Gulab Jamun, a sweet and syrupy dessert that was the perfect ending to an exquisite dining experience. The service was impeccable throughout the evening, with the waitstaff being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

Overall, my experience at Thanal Indian Tavern was nothing short of exceptional. The quality of the food, the inviting atmosphere, and the attentive service all contributed to a memorable evening.

"I am a huge fan of La Petite Grocery and I am confident this place will improve with time, if it has not already.  However, we went there during the week it opened and there were a few things that really surprised me.  
#1 we ordered the beef tartare and it did not come with a  single cracker, crisp, bread, nothing!  While the beef tartare was delicious, I did not enjoy having to just spoon it into my mouth.  The waitress informed us that the restaurant just does not have bread / does not serve that dish with anything else- well they should!
#2 our second dish was seafood and we have to ask (twice) for new plates and cutlery.  It appeared that our waiter did not understand why we would not want to eat fish off the same plate, etc as we had just used for raw beef.
#3 same as #2 above but for the next course.

To complement the beers, their gastropub fare is not to be missed. The highlight of my meal was the gourmet burger, cooked to perfection, with a side of the most decadent truffle fries. It was a treat that elevated the pub grub to haute cuisine.

Service here deserves its own accolades—attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly without being intrusive. They knew their brews and menu inside out.

"My recent visit to Wendy's was, unfortunately, a letdown, meriting a meager 2 out of 5 stars for several reasons. Starting with a positive, the recognizable red-and-yellow branding and menu promise of fresh, ""never frozen"" burgers initially set a hopeful stage, onto which the reality of the dining experience rapidly encroached.

Upon entering, the untidiness of the premises was immediately evident. Tables hadn't been cleaned promptly, and there was a discernible litter on the floor, leaving me to question the overall hygiene practices of this establishment. The staff, albeit operating in what looked like a stress-inducing environment, showed a lack of enthusiasm and customer engagement which can significantly detract from the fast-food experience. 

I ordered their classic Baconator and a side of fries. The burger, traditionally a behemoth of juicy flavors, was unfortunately lukewarm and lacked the expected freshness. The bacon, a key ingredient, was not as crispy as advertised, which undermined the sandwich's texture and overall tasting pleasure. The fries followed suit - lukewarm and regrettably soggy, lacking the essential crispness of a satisfying fry.

In their defense, the Frosty remained a redeemable feature - thick, creamy, and nostalgically consistent. Nonetheless, the shortfall in food and service quality overshadowed this cold comfort.

The convenience of fast food often comes with managed expectations, but even with a lenient outlook, Wendy's failed to bring their famed gusto to the table during this visit. For lovers of quick, hearty meals, this particular Wendy's is a miss, and you're likely better served elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Holiday Inn Express New Orleans Downtown, and overall, my experience was quite enjoyable. I would give it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

Upon arrival, we arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, but the staff was extremely accommodating and allowed us to check-in early. The service we received from the front desk was friendly and welcoming. The check-in process was quick, easy, and efficient, and all our questions were answered promptly. They even provided us with a map of the area, which came in handy during our stay.

Our room was located on the top floor, at the very end of the hallway. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive about the location, but it turned out to be a great spot. The room itself was well-equipped with a refrigerator and microwave, which came in handy for storing and reheating leftovers. The beds were comfortable, and the linen was clean and fresh. The air conditioning worked perfectly, which was much appreciated given the hot weather outside.

One aspect that I found slightly disappointing was the parking fee of $29 per day at the hotel. However, I found a nearby garage with in and out parking for only $20 per day, so I opted for that instead.

The hotel offers a continental breakfast from 6 am to 9 or 9:30 am. The breakfast spread included a variety of options, including turkey sausage, bacon, and omelets, which were a nice addition to the typical continental fare.

Another highlight of this hotel is its central location. It is conveniently situated, allowing for easy access to various sightseeing spots in the area. This made it convenient for us to explore the city and then return to the hotel without any hassle.

"Here's the dirty little secret about this place:  despite Taqueria del Sol being, well, a taqueria (shocker), it's actually the non-taco stuff where they excel. I've tried a couple tacos, and while you can't go wrong (e.g., with the carnitas), I didn't find them to be stand-out awesome either. Note that if you're tempted by the Memphis smoked tacos, they're topped with slaw, which may be a turn-on or a turn-off depending on your tastes.

The enchiladas are my favorite. I've been reasonably impressed with the brisket enchilada, which is best paired with the red chili sauce. The roasted chicken enchilada is decent too and begs for the pork green chili sauce. In fact, starting off with a cup of the shrimp corn chowder followed up with one of each enchilada is a meal for a king, and at a decent price too.

Of course, any Mexican meal without margaritas would be blasphemous. If you're feeling spendy (and not getting behind the wheel any time soon), the Westside specialty margaritas are especially tasty, and the flavor of the premium reposado tequila really comes out in them.

Overall, if you're in the 12th South neighborhood, Taqueria del Sol is a decent option. It  won't blow you away, but a boy could do far worse.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I had an incredible dining experience at HipCityVeg and I can confidently say that it's now one of my favorite restaurants. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations.

The food at HipCityVeg is absolutely delicious! I ordered their signature Ziggy Burger and it blew me away. The patty was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the combination of flavors with the special sauce and pickles was simply divine. The burger was served with a side of sweet potato fries that were crispy and full of flavor.

What impressed me the most about HipCityVeg was their commitment to sustainability. All the food is plant-based, which not only helps the environment but also ensures that every dish is packed with nutrients. The menu offers a wide variety of options, from fresh salads to mouthwatering sandwiches, making it a perfect place for vegans and non-vegans alike.

"Terakawa Ramen is an exciting addition to the 40th Street area. I was initially worried about the restaurant being overrun by college students, but to my surprise, the space was more open and designed beautifully. It was a pleasant change from the cramped atmosphere of the mother store in Chinatown.

My friend and I visited Terakawa Ramen around 2pm and found that it was not crowded. The waiter attempted to seat us right next to other customers, but the place was fairly empty, so we asked to sit elsewhere. Although the service was generally good, there was a slight feeling of imposition when we asked for different things. It might have been just that one waiter, so I'll reserve judgment until my next visit.

I ordered the Spicy Ramen, while my friend opted for the Vegetarian Ramen with soy sauce broth. My friend enjoyed the Vegetarian Ramen, and I was relieved to find that the Spicy Ramen tasted just as delicious as it does in the mother store. The only letdown was that the broth was not as hot as I would have liked - it was more on the lukewarm side. However, since the restaurant had only opened the previous week, I'm willing to give them some time to work out the kinks.

Overall, I left Terakawa Ramen thoroughly pleased with my lunch experience. The food was delicious, the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing, and the service, though slightly questionable at times, was satisfactory. It is important to note that Terakawa Ramen is a cash-only establishment, so remember to bring some extra cash with you.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"I ventured into Express Gas & Super Soft Car Wash with the best of hopes, intrigued by the concept of a dining experience adjacent to a place where cars are pampered. Regrettably, the establishment fell short of even the most basic culinary standards. Upon entrance, the sensory experience was dominated by the pungent smell of car wax and fuel - not something you want to accompany your meal. The ""restaurant,"" if one could stretch its meaning to such a Spartan setup, was furnished with worn-out chairs and the tables were sticky and littered with leftovers.

The menu seemed as tired as the surroundings, with choices that appeared to be an afterthought rather than a feature. I opted for the burger, which was a lesson in mediocrity; the patty was dry and tasted suspiciously like it had spent its day idling as the cars cleaned up outside. The accompanying fries were cold, soggy, with a greasiness that the car wash itself would struggle to remove. The kicker, however, was the service. Despite the place being almost empty, the staff managed to mix up orders and displayed a level of disinterest I had only previously seen in overworked postal employees during the holiday rush.

In an age where dining experiences are often about merging concepts, this establishment needs a serious overhaul in both theme execution and culinary pursuit. A one-star rating feels almost generous given the dismal merger of dining and car services attempted here. It’s a place you might fuel up your car, but certainly not yourself.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I've been here twice. Luckily when we went we were able to snag 2 of the 3 seats inside. In the winter when there's no option to sit outside I wouldn't plan on staying here to eat because there's a decent chance you wouldn't find seating. The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on. The first time we were there I saw the guy making the sandwiches pick up a garbage that fell over and then go back to cooking without washing his hands. I also saw another guy come up from the basement (not sure what's down there) and go in and start helping with food without washing his hands first. The second time I noticed the guy making the food pickup some sandwich wrappers from the floor and not wash his hands after. I think they should be more diligent with cleanliness. 

We had the Grick breakfast sandwich the first time. I thought it was great. Not too fatty, good amount of flavour. The arugula, aoili, egg, and bacon went together very well. The second time we tried the demogorgon. It was $9.25. It had smoked meat, gorgonzola cream, processed cheese, candied jalapeño, arugula, tomato and spicy mayo. I wouldn't order this again. There was very little meat. The meat seemed to be the only thing giving the sandwich any saltiness/flavour. I wouldn't mind if there was little meat as long as there was something else to give the sandwich sustenance. The arugula was 75% of the sandwich- this didn't compliment the sandwich, but instead took over. The bread was partially warm/toasted. I think the bread should have been more toasted. I would never recommend that sandwich to anyone.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"From the moment I stepped into Noobar, I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance exudes a warm and inviting atmosphere, with dim lighting and soft music that creates a tranquil dining environment. The staff greeted me with genuine smiles and an eagerness to ensure my dining experience was unforgettable.

Sitting down, the menu presented a plethora of inventive dishes, making the selection process tantalizingly difficult. I decided to start with the crispy calamari, which set the bar incredibly high. The squid was perfectly tender, encased in a light, golden crust that was seasoned to perfection, served with a zesty aioli that danced on the palate.

For my main course, the pan-seared scallops with a side of truffled mash was an absolute revelation. The scallops were seared to a golden crust yet remained succulent within, pairing perfectly with the rich, creamy texture of the mash. The dish was elevated further by the subtle use of truffle oil, which didn't overpower but rather complemented the flavors harmoniously.

No meal at Noobar would be complete without indulging in dessert, and the chocolate fondant was the crescendo to an already symphonic meal. It was a dessert of dreams, with a molten center of rich, dark chocolate that oozed out as I broke into the cake, contrasting wonderfully with the cool, sweet vanilla bean ice cream it was served with.

The wine list was extensive, but the knowledgeable staff were quick to recommend pairings that enhanced each course. From beginning to end, the service at Noobar was impeccable. Attentive without being intrusive, the staff truly knew how to cater to their customers' needs.

In conclusion, Noobar delivered an exquisite dining experience that deserved nothing less than five stars. It is a establishment I will surely recommend and return to.

They were running out of beer - the Hazy was out and the Mexican Lager was tapped which is was unfortunate. Also they couldn't get any of there standing heaters to work and the patio sure was chilly. 
I think with a little more attention to detail and TLC, this place could be great. The potential is certainly there.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Standard brunch food, but good service and exceptional view. 

I had the lobster benedict which game with small roasted potatoes. The potatoes were pretty good. Well-seasoned. The lobster benedict tasted fine. It suffered from bad presentation -- not normally something I care about but it was remarkably sloppy here. One of the English muffins was topped with lobster claw meat that was, for the most part, still in 'claw shape.' The other English muffin did not have any meat on top (it had all fallen to the side of the muffin). And it was pretty mangled - not discernibly 'claw shaped.' 

And I wish the lobster had been de-shelled better. One bite had cartilage in it. 

Not a place where I'd be drawn to for the food, but as I said the view is exceptional. So a decent spot for a slow brunch with friends enjoying the water view.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"For all the traveling I've done, this was the first time I had flown through Tampa. This seemed like one of the more logically organized airports, with a hub-and-spoke pattern that means no one gate is all that far from another.

I didn't have to go through security here, so I can't comment on that. But we were entirely comfortable during our layover, the selection of restaurants was decent (I hesitate to say that in any airport, but it's all relative ...), and we were promptly shipped off to our final destination with little ado!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At St Nicholas Greek Festival, the warmth of Greek hospitality envelops you the moment you step in. Bright, jubilant music invites your feet to tap, as the aroma of authentic Greek cuisine teases your senses. I indulged in the loukomades, sweet honey puffs that are little clouds of joy. Absolutely delectable! The moussaka was a harmonious layering of flavors — a comforting blend of spiced meat and creamy béchamel. Each dish celebrated the rich tapestry of Greek culinary tradition with gusto.

The vibe was a slice of Athens, with vibrant dance performances adding to the ambiance, echoing the communal spirit. The festival isn’t just a treat for the palate, but a feast for the soul as well. Despite a bustling crowd, the service was remarkable — attentive and quick, ensuring plates were full and hearts were content.

This wasn't just a meal; it was an immersive cultural journey. The festival’s seamless blend of delicious fare, festive atmosphere, and genuine camaraderie earns it a resounding five-star review. An event that’s as much about togetherness as it is about food. Highly recommended!",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I really liked this small brewery. It was adorably decorated and was quite quaint. 

We normally don't venture up north this far, and I was slightly surprised to see this in a strip mall. Walking in, you'd never imagine it looking the way it does from the outside. 

The walls were covered in rustic barn wood as were the tables and there were metal stools to seal the aesthetic. There is seating for around 30-40ish and it was pretty quiet for a Friday night. This was appreciated as I prefer conversation over a beer rather than yelling over music. Although I'm not a sports fan, they did have one large tv at the bar with the Pacers game playing. 

We started with a flight, all of which were really good. I decided on a Scotch Ale (which is completely out of the norm for me) as my pint of choice. Accompanying my pint was a Turkey Rueben. It was really very good, and not at all greasy or messy like Ruebens typically are. They also serve a side of Broad Ripple Chips which are super delish. 

The service was great and the bar tender was attentive and very nice. 

I really enjoyed this small brewery and will certainly return.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Restaurant Name: Pat's King of Steaks
Rating: ★★★★★

Review: From the moment I walked into Pat's King of Steaks, I knew I was in for a treat. The aroma of sizzling steak filled the air, making my mouth water in anticipation. The line was long, but it moved quickly, thanks to the efficient and friendly staff.

When it was finally my turn, I ordered their classic Philly cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz, just as it should be. The sandwich was prepared right in front of me, and I couldn't help but be impressed by the skill and speed of the cooks. Within minutes, I was handed a hot, delicious sandwich.

As I took my first bite, I was immediately blown away. The thinly sliced steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor. The onions added a pleasant sweetness, complementing the savory meat. The cheese whiz melted beautifully, adding a creamy and indulgent element to the sandwich. The bread was soft yet chewy, providing the ideal vehicle for all the delicious fillings.

The portion size was generous, ensuring that each bite was filled with the delicious combination of flavors. Every mouthful was a delight, and I found myself savoring every bite.

The atmosphere at Pat's King of Steaks was lively and energetic, with both locals and tourists enjoying their meals. The staff was attentive and friendly, providing excellent service throughout my visit.

Overall, I had an exceptional experience at Pat's King of Steaks. The quality of the food, the friendly service, and the vibrant atmosphere all contributed to a memorable dining experience. I highly recommend Pat's King of Steaks to anyone looking for an authentic and delicious Philly cheesesteak.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Visited Blaze Pizza with high expectations for a speedy custom pie experience. The concept of crafting your own pizza with an array of fresh toppings remains a draw, and this aspect of Blaze did not disappoint. The selection was ample, allowing creativity in pizza design, and the staff was generally efficient in assembling the orders. 

However, the cooking was inconsistent; while the crust on the edges was pleasingly crispy, the center proved a tad underdone. The sauce-to-cheese ratio skewed slightly sauce-heavy for my taste, but this may vary by personal preference. 

The atmosphere of the place was energetic, though the acoustics made it a bit loud, and seating was comfortable. The cleanliness of the dining area was satisfactory, but the restrooms needed more attention.

Service was a mixed bag - some staff members were cheerful, while others seemed indifferent, lacking the warm hospitality that can elevate a dining experience. 

Overall, Blaze Pizza offers a decent quick-built pizza at a fair price point, so it stands as a solid choice for a casual meal, especially for those with eclectic topping tastes. A 3-star experience with room for improvement in both culinary consistency and service.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I'm so glad that there's finally a little bit more life in Riverview with the addition of this movie theater! This is one of two relatively new movie theaters on this side of town built around the same time and opened this year. This is not your average, basic movie theater. This movie theater comes with big comfy reclining couches with cupholders for everyone in every theater within this building. The architecture and interior design was pretty interesting too. I saw a few good movies here already and had a good experience each time.

As usual, there's the concession stand.  This concession stand also serves beer and wine, in addition to the usual movie theater snacks and drinks. I was intrigued by the fact that this movie theater also has a restaurant and full bar. I've never eaten at a movie theater restaurant before. The quality of the food and drinks were surprisingly good. Even if I don't come here to watch a movie, I would definitely eat here or stop by for a drink outing at their bar. They have friendly, helpful staff as you would expect at any movie theater or restaurant.

I recommend choosing this movie theater if you happen to be on this side of town.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"$5 entry is acceptable for a cramped house with three rooms full of voodoo stuff. Less commercial feel than the voodoo shops that forbid pictures.

Background music ranges from thematic tribal to vaguely relevant pop. One bathroom in the entrance hallway with a broken lock. Exhibits are by no means polished.

"I recently had the opportunity to dine at Kilroy's Bar N' Grill, and unfortunately, my experience left much to be desired. I gave it a generous 2 stars out of 5. Upon entering, I was greeted by a dimly lit interior that felt worn-out and in need of renovation. The noise level was incredibly high, making it difficult to have a conversation with my dining companions.

The service was lackluster at best. Our server seemed disinterested and took an unusually long time to take our orders. The food, when it finally arrived, was underwhelming. The menu boasted a variety of options, but the execution fell short. My burger was overcooked and dry, while my friend's pasta dish was bland and lacked flavor.

The prices were quite high given the subpar quality of the food. The portion sizes were also disappointingly small. I expected more value for my money, but unfortunately, Kilroy's fell short on that front as well.

To make matters worse, the cleanliness of the restaurant was questionable. Tables were sticky, and the floors looked like they hadn't been properly cleaned in days. This made for an uncomfortable dining experience.

On a positive note, the drink selection was decent, with a variety of beers and cocktails available. However, this alone is not enough to redeem the overall experience.

In conclusion, Kilroy's Bar N' Grill fell short in many aspects. From the lackluster service, underwhelming food, and subpar cleanliness, it failed to meet my expectations. I would not recommend this establishment to others looking for a satisfying dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"Nestled in the heart of the city is Vientiane Bistro, a culinary gem offering a vibrant taste of Laos. On entering, the ambience struck a cozy balance between authentic Southeast Asian charm and understated modernity. Traditional music and decor set the stage for an immersive dining experience.

The service was attentive without being intrusive. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and willingly navigated us through the menu's highlights. We started with an assortment of appetizers, notably the crispy spring rolls, which were a standout with their aromatic filling and light, crackling pastry.

For the main course, the star was undoubtedly the grilled lemongrass chicken – succulent and infused with just the right amount of char and exotic flavors. The accompanying sticky rice, a staple in Lao cuisine, was perfectly steamed, enhancing the flavors of the dishes it paired with.

The vibrant flavors continued with the papaya salad, offering a delightful mix of sweet, sour, and spice, meticulously balanced that tantalized the taste buds. However, not all dishes hit the same high note. The beef laap, while flavorful, was somewhat overshadowed by an excess of herbs that slightly overwhelmed the palate. 

Dessert options were limited but delightful. The mango sticky rice concluded the meal on a sweet, satisfying note, with the ripe mango's freshness offering an exquisite contrast to the creamy rice.

While one might encounter more consistent flavor harmonizing at other establishments, the creativity and heart put into each dish merited a solid 4-star experience. Vientiane Bistro stands as a testament to authentic Lao cooking, well worth revisiting for anyone seeking a culinary adventure.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Restaurant Review: Philadelphia Marriott Old City (5 Stars)

I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Philadelphia Marriott Old City, and I must say, it was a truly exceptional experience. From start to finish, every aspect of the restaurant exceeded my expectations and left me completely satisfied.

"Stepping into Roma Pizza & Pasta, I was immediately enveloped in the alluring aroma of fresh dough and simmering tomato sauce, hinting at the traditional culinary adventure that awaited. From the moment our cheerful server greeted us, the impeccable service and warm ambiance set a welcoming tone.

Our dining experience kicked off with the garlic knots, which were a revelation—pillowy soft with the perfect hint of garlic and olive oil, they were an irresistible preamble to the main course. As for the main attraction, I opted for their signature Margherita pizza. The harmonious blend of vibrant tomatoes, rich mozzarella, and fresh basil atop a flawlessly charred crust was nothing short of artistry. Each bite melded together the simple, high-quality ingredients, echoing the time-honored traditions of Italian cooking.

Not to be overshadowed, the fettuccine alfredo was creamy perfection, with a sauce that was decadent without overwhelming the palate, and pasta cooked to al dente perfection. The dish was comfort food elevated to an exquisite level.

Even as we rounded off the meal with a slice of their velvety tiramisu, the consistency in the excellence of each dish was clear. From the starters to the desserts, the authenticity and intricate flavors of Roma Pizza & Pasta unequivocally earned a five-star rating from me. I left with a satisfied palate and the anticipation of a return visit to explore more of their culinary delights.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The menu boasted a wide variety of options, from classic French dishes to innovative twists on old favorites. I decided to start with the escargot, which was perfectly cooked and served with a divine garlic butter sauce. For the main course, I opted for the Coq au Vin, a rich and hearty dish that melted in my mouth. The accompanying side of creamy mashed potatoes was the perfect complement.

The attention to detail and presentation was outstanding. Each dish looked like a work of art, and you could tell that the chefs took great pride in their creations. The portions were generous, ensuring that I left feeling satisfied and content.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Edley's Bar-B-Que in the 12 South neighborhood, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and inviting, with a rustic yet trendy decor that exuded a cozy and relaxed atmosphere.

The menu at Edley's Bar-B-Que offered a wide variety of BBQ options, which made it difficult to choose just one. I ultimately settled on their famous brisket, and boy, was I not disappointed. The meat was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The smoky flavor was simply delicious and paired perfectly with their homemade BBQ sauce.

The sides at Edley's also deserve a special mention. The mac and cheese was creamy and rich, with just the right amount of cheesy goodness. The collard greens were well seasoned and had a nice kick of flavor. And let's not forget the cornbread, which was moist and slightly sweet, a perfect accompaniment to the BBQ.

The service at Edley's Bar-B-Que was outstanding. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were happy to answer any questions I had and provided excellent recommendations.

The only reason why I am not giving Edley's Bar-B-Que a full 5-star rating is because of the slightly long wait for a table. However, considering the overall experience and the quality of the food, it was a minor inconvenience.

Overall, I highly recommend Edley's Bar-B-Que in the 12 South neighborhood. It's a great spot to satisfy your BBQ cravings and indulge in some mouthwatering Southern comfort food.

"Restaurant Name: Due Amici
Rating: 1 out of 5 stars

Review:

My experience at Due Amici was disappointing to say the least. From the moment I called to inquire about delivery options, I was met with unhelpful and confusing information. I was directed to order through Uber Eats, only to find out that my location was just outside of their delivery zone. Frustrated, I decided to drive to the restaurant to pick up my order instead.

Upon calling to place the order, I was informed that they were only making pizzas due to being busy. I was taken aback by this, as I had specifically requested two Strombolis and a gyro. It made no sense to me that they would limit their menu in this way, especially considering their promise of a 20-minute delivery guarantee for orders placed through Uber Eats.

Disappointed and hungry, my companions and I decided to order from another restaurant instead. It was a shame that Due Amici was unable to accommodate our order and provide the desired variety.

Overall, my experience at Due Amici was highly unsatisfactory. The lack of clear and consistent communication regarding their delivery options, coupled with their refusal to fulfill our order, left a bitter taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"Regrettably, my foray into Sam's Club was an unequivocally dispiriting experience. Upon arrival, the atmosphere was notably lackluster; a unique fusion of apathy and confusion seemed to radiate from the staff which did little to invite a welcoming ambiance. 

The dining area was unkempt, marred by cluttered tables and a floor speckled with debris; immediate attention to cleanliness was desperately needed. Service was painfully slow, creating an atmosphere of frustration rather than the anticipated enjoyment of a meal out.

As for the food itself, it was a dismal affair. Our appetizer, a bowl of clam chowder, arrived lukewarm and insipid, hinting at a possible prolonged existence under a heat lamp. The entrée, a steak touted as the 'house specialty', succumbed to overcooking, rendering it tough and void of succulence. Accompanying vegetables were an uninspired afterthought, lacking both seasoning and freshness.

Moreover, despite the restaurant’s emptiness, the staff seemed inconvenienced by our presence. Requests for basic condiments were met with exasperation, and the anticipation of a refill for a parched drink became a faded dream.

To note, attempts to voice concerns over the meal were met with dismissive attitudes, promptly crushing any remnants of hope for a recovery in customer service. The unwillingness to genuinely engage with diners or address their issues underscores a critical area of improvement necessary for Sam's Club.

Alas, there remains a glaring chasm between the potential of what Sam's Club could offer and the stark reality of its present execution. An overhaul in both culinary delivery and customer interaction is essential before I could endorse a return visit. As of this instance, I can only urge diners to consider alternative establishments for their dining endeavors.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Biz On Fletcher and would give it 5 stars without hesitation! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who made me feel welcome. The atmosphere of the restaurant is charming and cozy, with a rich history that adds to its appeal.

My stylist, Haley, was fantastic. She took the time to understand my hair needs and listened to my preferences. She even looked at the photos I brought in, showing her dedication to giving me the perfect haircut. We ultimately decided on a sexy soft pixie cut, and I couldn't be happier with the result. Haley's attention to detail and skill in styling made my hair look amazing.

What sets Biz On Fletcher apart is the extra care they provide. Not only did I receive a chair massage during my haircut, but I also got a mini facial! It was such a pleasant surprise and added to the overall relaxation and enjoyment of my visit.

Throughout my time at the restaurant, the staff was attentive and friendly. They even engaged in fun conversation about the Super Bowl, making the experience feel personal and comfortable.

"I came to Roberto's Trattoria for dinner during happy hour on a weekday evening at roughly 5 PM while starving for some good food with my girlfriend.  The restaurant sits on the corner of Bethlehem Pike and Montgomery Avenue.  The restaurant is inside a small building, easily distinguishable by the sign outside.  When you enter the restaurant, there is a bar with a TV and then up a few stairs behind the bar is the restaurant seating area.  We decided to sit at a high table along the large glass window at the bar instead of sitting in the back.  The bar started out with only a few people there but eventually it was packed for a good 30 minutes until a handful of people left simultaneously after having drinks together.  It seemed a lot of people knew each other here as possibly regulars.

First off, our waiter was Roberto which was funny as he walked up to the table with an Italian accent and said ""Welcome to Roberto's Trattoria, I am Roberto"".  It was quite funny as we did not expect to have a waiter with the same name as the restaurant but unfortunately he wasn't the owner.  He also used Italian words while serving us which benefits the Italian restaurant experience.  He provided very good service, always checking on our table to make sure we were satisfied and not waiting too long for anything such as drink refills or plate removals.  To start off, my girlfriend ordered a wine while I had a Pinot Grigio.  There seemed to be a decent wine list but we stuck to the glass as we didn't feel the need to order a whole bottle.

For starters, we ordered the calamari alla puttanesca.  The calamari was tasty and included both rings and legs.  It was flavored with olives, red sauce, and anchovies which provided a very good taste.  It was definitely one of the better calamari orders I have had in a while from a few restaurants.  Next, we received a salad with our entree which included greens and small tomatos with a choice of sauce in which we both chose balsamic vinaigrette.  The salad was good and seemed pretty fresh.  The balsamic vinaigrette was not overwhelming like at some restaurants so it was a decent salad even though I always try to avoid eating it at home or at a restaurant.  Personally, I never loved salad and am a die hard meat fan.  

For entrees, my girlfriend went with the rigatoni alla rustica which was absolutely delicious.  I personally do not go crazy for pasta regardless of my quarter or so percentage of Sicilian heritage but I really enjoyed the rigatoni and it reminded me of a traditional family pasta dinner my grandmother would prepare when I was a kid.  The combination of mushrooms, pecorino, and sausage made a great topping to the rigatoni.  I had the veal oscar which was good but didn't fill my meat crave meter as it was a thinner cut of veal.  In honesty I was craving a burger that night but decided to try somewhere new that my girlfriend really wanted to go.  The crab and mushroom topping was pretty good and the spinach definitely added a nice flavor.  The food came out steaming hot so I had to wait a minute for it to cool to prevent burning my tongue.  This isn't a bad thing as I definitely do not want the food cold.

For dessert, we both ordered an espresso and decided to share the cannoli dessert and tres leches cake.  The espressos were very good and so were the desserts.  The tres leches cake was delicious and was definitely a nice way to finish the meal.  

Overall, I definitely recommend Roberto's Trattoria to anybody looking to enjoy some real deal Italian food.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"The dim lighting of this restaurant made me think I would pay two arms and a leg for food here. It has a really nice atmosphere and it would make a really nice fancy date.

The reason this place is only 4 stars is that my friend ordered a special that turned out to be $28 and that was almost 2x the price that we had expected. In fact, nothing on the menu indicated it would be that expensive! So it was a bit of a shock to us. I wish they had a way to indicate the price discrepancy (we may not have gotten it then). Granted, it WAS our fault for not thinking to ask but I thought it was worth mentioning. With that said, I did really enjoy the food we had.

The free appetizer plantain chips were very good and the sauce that they came with made them that much better. I highly recommend this!

One friend go the lomo saltado ($17) and thought it was very good but not as good as the place he used to go to in mississippi (i'll chalk that one up to nostalgia). I got the  saltado de champignones ($14) and very much so enjoyed my food. I especially loved the spices.We also got some sweet plantains. My other friend got the aforementioned special that night. It was beef ans shrimp based (aka there were 3 shrimp), cooked brilliantly, and wonderful. We were all very impressed with her dish until the pricing.

"OK this place has changed owners and food since those positive reviews were written. It's now run by a family from Trinidad (not that there's anything wrong with being from Trinidad but it's obviously not the people in the pictures) The Q now comes absolutely slathered  in not good sauce, What little I did taste of the ribs beyond the sauce was not all that great. It was very fatty and I suspect it was boiled then finished  off on a grill. I got mac and cheese and beans on the side. Mac and cheese was inedible (strong plastic taste)  and the beans were just out of a can or something. The only thing that saved this place from a one star review were the chicken wings. They are advertised as being smoked not fried and they were also slathered in sauce but they were pretty tasty under the sauce. I'll go back and try the wings with the sauce on the side but stay away from the Q it's not at all what you see in the pictures and it's NOT GOOD. If the wings are good I might boot them up to 3 stars but no higher.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"For an inexpensive nail salon, you really can't do better. than Beautiful Nails. 

I've been going to this salon for years and have followed them through 2 moves. They started on Brentwood in a strip mall that was torn down when the Villas of Brentwood were build. Then they moved to another strip mall, farther south on Brentwood, where Radio Shack is located (across from Face & Body). 

Last year they built their own building on Manchester near Brentwood, and the new place is definitely work being 5 minutes farther from my house. It is clean and spacious with plenty of waiting area seating, pedicure chairs and work stations that don't have you crammed in together. 

Everyone is friendly, and rarely do walk-in visitors have to wait long. I've been having Anne do my nails for years, and she gets booked up so I make appointments for all of my visits...but she can usually get me in within a couple of days. 

If you make appointments for one of the more popular technicians, Jill (the receptionist) and San (the owner) will get to know your name and say hello every time you arrive. 

It's also cheap. I get my fills done for $22 including tip. 

TIP: they can't add a tip to your credit card after they run it, so ask how much it is and tell them to include the tip in the total, or plan on bringing cash for the tip.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"The Slippery Noodle Inn was an interesting dining experience. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the lively atmosphere. The walls were adorned with photographs and memorabilia, giving the restaurant a unique and cozy feel. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we were comfortable throughout our meal.

The menu at Slippery Noodle Inn offered a variety of options, ranging from classic American dishes to more adventurous choices. I opted for their famous breaded pork tenderloin sandwich, which came with a side of fries. The sandwich was massive, perfectly breaded and seasoned, and the pork was juicy and tender. The fries were crispy and flavorful, and I enjoyed every bite.

However, while the food was decent, it didn't quite reach the level of excellence that I had anticipated. The flavors were good, but they lacked the wow factor that would have made the experience truly memorable. Additionally, I found the portion sizes to be on the smaller side, especially considering the price.

Another aspect that somewhat disappointed me was the drink selection. While they had a decent variety of beers and spirits, I felt that the cocktail menu was lacking creativity. The cocktails I tried were well-made, but they didn't stand out from what you could find at any other bar.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the Slippery Noodle Inn had its charm. The live music was a definite highlight of the evening. The band was talented, and their performance added to the already vibrant atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a great way to unwind and enjoy the evening.

The service at Slippery Noodle Inn was notable. The staff was friendly and attentive, always ensuring our needs were met. The wait times were reasonable, and our server was knowledgeable about the menu, offering recommendations based on our preferences.

In terms of pricing, Slippery Noodle Inn falls within the average range for a restaurant of its kind. However, I do feel that the portion sizes and overall quality of the food could have been improved to match the prices.

Overall, I would rate my experience at Slippery Noodle Inn as 3 out of 5 stars. While the atmosphere, live music, and service were enjoyable, the food and drinks didn't quite live up to my expectations. It's a decent spot for a night out, but I would recommend exploring other options if you're looking for a truly exceptional dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"Stepping into Old Town Donut Shop is like a sweet embrace from nostalgia herself; this haven of sugary delights whisks you away to simpler times where every bite seems to say ""welcome home."" As I wandered through the door, the cozy ambiance enveloped me immediately, transporting me back to my childhood when a fresh donut was the highest of treats.

With its retro decor and the hum of local chatter, the shop exudes warmth and comfort. The staff were the cherries on top - their smiles as genuine as the delicious flavors they serve. They danced behind the counter with a grace that can only come from true craftsmanship, skillfully doling out vibrant sprinkled creations, alongside the classic glazed that glisten under the display lights like edible pearls.

Each donut - a masterpiece. The dough, airy and light yet satisfying, paired with a glaze that is the epitome of the perfect kiss of sweetness. And oh, the fillings - whether bursting from bear claws or oozing from jelly delights - were fresh and flavorful, the product of evident passion and expertise. The coffee, robust and fragrant, made a perfect companion, turning a simple snack into a full-on taste experience.

In an era where culinary artistry often bows to high-speed convenience, Old Town Donut Shop stands out as a bastion of tradition and quality. It easily rivals any gourmet boutique with its unassuming excellence. A five-star gem in the community, I left with a contented belly and the sure knowledge that I'd return.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pho Quyen, and I must say, it was an absolutely amazing experience. From the moment I walked in, the warm and inviting ambiance set the tone for a memorable meal. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring that every detail was taken care of.

The menu at Pho Quyen is extensive and offers a wide range of Vietnamese delicacies. I decided to start with their fresh spring rolls, which were bursting with flavors and wrapped in delicate rice paper. For the main course, I couldn't resist ordering their signature Pho soup. The broth was rich and aromatic, and the Pho noodles and thinly sliced beef were cooked to perfection. Every spoonful was a delight to the taste buds.

What truly impressed me about Pho Quyen was their commitment to using fresh and high-quality ingredients. The vegetables in my spring rolls were crisp and vibrant. The herbs and spices in the Pho soup were fragrant and had a distinct freshness that elevated the dish to new heights. It is evident that the chefs at Pho Quyen are passionate about their craft and take great pride in delivering exceptional flavors.

The portion sizes at Pho Quyen were generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling satisfied and content. The prices were also very reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food served. Moreover, the restaurant was clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall pleasant dining experience.

I can confidently say that Pho Quyen has become one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants, and I will definitely be coming back for more.

"I'll start by saying that I love this restaurant, but they have been so inconsistent lately that I have hesitated to review for quite some time. 

The food is incredible. Chips and salsa are delivered to the table and are always delicious- ask for a green salsa as well! I am amazed at the quality of seafood that I have had here, several different ceviche options and they're all amazing. The molcajetes are out of this world amazing. The flavors are strong, a generous portion of meat, etc. the tortillas are warm and fresh. 

The drinks are delicious. Try the mixed berry margarita- you'll thank me later. You can't go wrong with a pitcher of house margarita for the table, the michelada mix is amazing and I usually get that with Modelo. The mango michelada is like an alcoholic smoothie and so sweet and delicious!

The inside is painted in fun colors and both booths and tables are comfortable. Restrooms are almost always clean. The outside patio is amazing when it's open. They have live bands on the weekend, the string lights, the fountain, the umbrellas. It's a whole summer time vibe and I love to hang out here. 

Now the nitty gritty part that makes me so mad- because as mentioned above- this place is incredible!!

Phone- they don't answer it when it is on, usually it's off, and the voicemail box has been full for at least 6 months. 

Service- very hit or miss. Sometimes it's incredible, friendly, quick. Sometimes it's downright degrading with unfriendly staff and obscene wait times. Half the table will get their food within 15 minutes, and the other half can wait over an hour. It feels like they make a point not to look at you when they walk past so it's hard to flag them down. Waters go 30+ minutes without refilling. When food does come out often you can tell it's been sitting under a warmer. I always stick my finger in the guac and sour cream- if it's warm I ask for fresh stuff. 

Pricing is fair for the quality of food, but not the service.

"La Creperia Cafe is a hidden gem in town. I had an amazing experience and give it a solid 5 stars out of 5. 

The crepes at La Creperia Cafe are absolutely delicious. I tried the Curry Crepe, which has become my go-to crepe. The combination of flavors was perfect and left me wanting more. Surprisingly, the Texan crepe was also delightful, with its unique blend of ingredients. However, I wasn't too fond of the French Riviera crepe.

For dessert, I recommend the Romeo y Julieta crepe. It was the perfect finale to my meal. The crepes at La Creperia Cafe are slightly thinner than traditional crepes, but the flavor and portion sizes are spot on. 

I also appreciate the small side salad that accompanies the crepes. It adds a fresh and light touch to the meal. Moreover, the service was excellent, and the staff was friendly and attentive.

La Creperia Cafe has gone through some changes since I started visiting, but the flavor and quality have never been compromised. Additionally, they even offer cider, which is a pleasant surprise.

The Peri Wings were also enjoyable, with meat that effortlessly came off the bone.

"**My review is based solely on the store itself. I did not use  grooming veterinarian or boarding services of this business.**

My wife and I stopped in here to pick up dog food because we noticed that was an excellent Yelp deal, and that the establishment had equally good Yelp reviews.

We came only for dog food but it appears that this business also offers boarding, grooming, and it looked like there may have even been veterinarian services available. The location is a good one right off of Dale Mabry, and when you go inside the business is clean, well organized, and had everything we thought a discerning pet owner would expect to see in a pet store.

The prices were average, however with the Yelp deal including a yelp check in deal, buying a bag of dog food here was a terrific value. The only opportunity for improvement that we found was that the young lady working the cash register seemed disinterested, frustrated, and borderline annoyed when we tried to redeem the coupons we had. Happy ending to the story is that she required a manager to figure out how to properly use these particular coupons, and the manager was beyond nice and accommodating.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

I had a scoop cinnamon and lemon raspberry. The flavors were intense. The ice cream was super creamy. I thought the cinnamon was the best cinnamon ice cream I've ever had.

The ice cream arrived at our table and we were all happy once again, except for the one person who ordered a sundae. Again, no whipped cream, and this time they were also out of nuts.

The rotating bar added a unique touch, creating a fun and interactive atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout the evening. The menu offered a diverse selection of cocktails and small plates, each beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.

"I love going out to dinner, to a fancy restaurant, and waited on like I am royalty.
Well, I am kind of. I come from the kingdom of Wingfield Springs.
This restaurant is hands down one of the best steak restaurant's in the area.
The service was impeccable. Our waiter was always asking if everything was OK, but not bothering us.
I ordered the clam chowder to start with, and the filet Mignon with a potatoe as my entree.
Both the soup and steak were delicious. 
I ordered the steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. You almost could cut the steak with your fork it was that tender.
I hope to come back soon.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Target restaurant and overall, I had a really enjoyable experience. The ambiance was modern and inviting, creating a relaxed atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of throughout our visit.

The menu at Target offered a wide variety of options, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. I opted for the grilled salmon with a side of roasted vegetables and was thoroughly impressed. The salmon was perfectly cooked, flaky and flavorful, while the vegetables were fresh and seasoned to perfection. The portion size was also generous, leaving me feeling satisfied.

What truly stood out for me was the presentation of the dishes. Each plate was beautifully plated, showcasing a combination of colors and textures that were visually appealing. It definitely added to the overall dining experience.

The only reason I didn't give Target a full 5 stars was the speed of service. While the staff was attentive and friendly, the wait time for our dishes was longer than expected. However, it didn't significantly impact my overall experience.

In terms of pricing, the menu at Target was reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. It felt like a good value for money spent.

Overall, I would highly recommend Target restaurant for a satisfying dining experience. The delicious food, charming ambiance, and attentive staff make it a great choice for any occasion. I look forward to returning in the future to try more of their menu offerings.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"I recently decided to give Lucky Beaver Bar & Burger a try during my lunch break. With its catchy name and bustling atmosphere, I was intrigued to see if this place lived up to the hype. Overall, my experience was decent, earning it a solid three stars out of five.

Walking in, I was immediately taken aback by the lively atmosphere and energetic staff. The interior had a rustic charm, with a mix of modern and classic decor. The place was buzzing with people, adding to the overall ambiance. It was clear that this spot was a popular choice for locals and tourists alike.

After being seated, I perused the menu. The selection of burgers was impressive, and it was clear that the restaurant prided itself on its patty creations. I decided to go for their classic Lucky Burger, accompanied by a side of sweet potato fries.

The wait for the food was not too long, considering the crowd. When my burger arrived, it looked promising. The patty was cooked to perfection, with a juicy and flavorful center. The bun was slightly toasted, adding a nice crunch to each bite. However, I couldn't help but feel that the toppings were lacking. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, but I would have loved a bit more creativity. Perhaps some unique sauces or specialty toppings would have elevated the overall experience.

The sweet potato fries on the side were a delightful surprise. Perfectly seasoned and crispy, they added a nice balance to the meal. They were the highlight of my dining experience at Lucky Beaver.

Unfortunately, the service was a bit lackluster. Although the staff seemed friendly, they appeared overwhelmed by the sheer volume of customers. It was challenging to get their attention when I needed something, and it took quite a while to get the bill after finishing my meal.

In terms of pricing, Lucky Beaver Bar & Burger falls within a reasonable range. The prices are not overly expensive, but they are not a steal either. Given the quality of the food and the portion sizes, I felt that the cost was fair.

Overall, Lucky Beaver Bar & Burger is a decent spot to grab a burger if you're in the area. The atmosphere is lively, and the food, while not mind-blowing, is enjoyable. However, the lack of creativity in the toppings and the subpar service held it back from receiving a higher rating. If you're in the mood for a solid burger and don't mind a bit of a wait, give it a try.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

The El Duende had rum and eggnog plus other things, and it had some spices, which made the drink more interesting. It was very unique and amazing, but the Clasico is definitely the best hot chocolate out there. Warning: the El Duende is VERY decadent! Far more than the Clasico.

"Heritage Festival is arguably the premier summer festival in Edmonton!

For those of you that don't know what Heritage Festival is it is essentially a multi-cultural festival with  food, art, dance, song, etc from many different cultures.  And while many of the performances, etc are very good... Let's admit it, the big draw for many is the food. 

Tickets (in 2015) are 30 for $25.  How much food that gets you depends on the country.  Food items generally range from 2 tickets to 8 tickets.  Portions are decent - my wife and I would usually be full on 30 tickets.  

Top tips for the festival - go earlier in the day.  Shorter lines all around and the weather isn't as hot! And don't forget to buy your tickets in advance at either Servus Credit Union branches, Save On Foods or Tix On the Square!

Either way this is a can't miss festival in the city!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Lived up to the hype for sure. 
We were a party of four, that arrived around 6:15 on Saturday night. There are only 6 tables in the restaurant. They were all taken, so we sat at the bar for a few minutes while we waited for one to open up. I am so glad we did, because the bartender(I forget his name) was great! He made my friend one of their signature drinks called a Marble Eyed Dog, which was gin based and delicious. My buddy and I were in the mood for beer, and when we asked what was on, he told us we could do ""mystery beers"". He would charge us 3 bucks and we could be surprised. He asked if we would like hoppy, malty, drinkable, or ""different"". We ordered hoppy and out came two cold Sierra Nevada Torpedos. Great deal! By the end of the night we had tried all of his mystery beers, as well as a Russian River Damnation. 
We were sat in the only table in the back towards the end of the bar. It was cozy, and perfectly sized for the four of us. From my seat I could see part of the kitchen, including the flaming grill, which sealed the deal for me to order the much talked about burger. 
Our table started with the Grilled Truffeled Mushroom Flatbread. It had Goat Cheese, Fennel, Roasted Peppers, and Pickled Green Tomatoes. It was really good. We also shared an order of the House Pickled Vegetables. They were fantastic. The jars of pickling vegetables are lined up around the bar, and it was a nice touch to have them on the menu. It consisted of Okra, Haricot Vert, Carrots, and Mushrooms. The pickle had a nice kick to it. 
I ordered 3 oysters, they were Malbecs. I watched the chef open them and they tasted fresh. The green Tabasco mignonette was a really nice touch. I had the ""My Burger"" as my entree. It is a 9oz Angus patty with BBQ Aioli, Fried Green Tomatoes, Smoked Bacon, and Creamy Goat Cheese. I ordered it Medium Rare, and it came out Medium. I didn't care because it was so good, and constructed very well. The bun was perfect and the sandwich held together until the very last bite. My dining partners ordered the Duck Jambalaya, the blackened chicken sandwich, and a shrimp po boy. My friend who had the shrimp po boy stated during dinner ""Now THIS is a Po Boy!"" 
Our server Jess was fine. The first words out of her mouth were ""do you have any questions?"" uhh do you? 
We ordered 2 desserts to share. A roasted Pear Cobbler with Bourbon Gelato, and Pecan Pie with Buttermilk Gelato. HOLY F'N PECAN PIE! This was hands down the best Pecan Pie I have ever eaten. It simply shattered what I thought was the best Pecan Pie I had ever had 10 years prior, in Louisiana no less. The four of us almost came to blows for the last bite, but I was victorious! 
It was really great that they had the football game on as well. The sound was turned down and wasn't obtrusive in the slightest. Overall I was very impressed with Catahoula, and I really look forward to going back soon, especially to sit and watch a Phils game at that great bar.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I'm ashamed to say that I had my first experience at palace cafe recently after working in the quarter for about 7 years. I had heard great things but never experienced it. I regret not going sooner. 
The building and dining room are absolutely beautiful. It's open and bright and comfortable without losing the ambiance of fine dining. I ate at the second floor bar. I actually went solo before work that night. I work around the corner and was happy to see familiar faces from post work cocktails. There was a light jazz duo playing. 
The bartender greeted me and happily made my favorite cocktail, a sazerac. It was perfect. 
I got a the fromage, a cheese board. Two goats milk and two cows milk. The Valdeon Bleu was exquisite. The most incredible bleu cheese I have had. My second favorite was the Miticana goats milk cheese. It's two textural and flavorful experiences in one. I took my time and finished the board while doing my ""I love food happy dance"". 
I had a lovely shrimp remoulade. I love fried green tomatoes. Especially the thin cut wedges served under the shrimp. Light and refreshing dish.  
My favorite part of the meal was the famed crab meat cheesecake. If you go there and only get one thing, don't miss out. It was the most delicious thing to ever cross my lips. I savored every small bite down to the last bit of crust. The crab claws on top delighted me. The reduction around it was a perfect compliment. I didn't want it to end. 
Now you're probably wondering how one average girl can eat so much. Well, I love food. So I continued on to entrees. Taking into account that I had to go to work post meal, I went for fish instead of steak and chose the andouille crusted fish. Wonderful choice. Not too heavy, very flavorful, cooked perfectly. I enjoyed a cocktail made from rosemary infused vodka and lemon along with it. Next came dessert. I got the chocolate smores cake. It was rich, dense and heavy. Even if I hadn't just basically eaten a meal for two, I would have had to share it with at least one person. I got about 1/4 into it and although thoroughly enjoyed it, had to take it with me and head to work. I ate it throughout the next day.   I'll be making me way back on the regular, just for craft cocktails and crab cheesecake if nothing else.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

For appetizer, I ordered the bacon and cheese tart (minus the caramelized onions) and loved every bite.  The bacon was soooo thick, not an overwhelming amount of cheese, bust just enough and thin crust which is perfect to really taste the bacon and the cheese. 

Finally, for my meal I got the shrimp and grits, with eggs and crab meat.  It ended up being something like $25, but, it was PHENOMENAL.  One of the best breakfast/brunch dishes I have ever had.

But the real disappointment came when I received my snowball. The flavors were bland and lacked any depth or creativity. It was as if they simply poured some syrup over a cup of ice and called it a day. The texture was also off-putting, with chunks of ice still present, making it difficult to fully enjoy.

To make matters worse, the seating area was unclean and cramped. The tables were sticky and not properly wiped down, and the chairs were uncomfortable. It's clear that this place lacks any attention to detail or concern for cleanliness.

I also found the prices to be exorbitant for the subpar quality of the snowballs. I left feeling completely unsatisfied and ripped off.

"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Frost Gelato and I must say, it was a delightful experience. From the moment I entered the charming little shop until the last luscious bite of gelato, everything was simply excellent.

The ambiance of Frost Gelato is cozy and inviting, with its warm lighting and comfortable seating. The staff welcomed me with friendly smiles and promptly offered their assistance. The wall adorned with vibrant gelato flavors immediately caught my attention, and I couldn't wait to indulge in their varied assortment.

The gelato itself was truly a work of art. The flavors at Frost Gelato are as unique as they are delicious. From classics like chocolate and vanilla to more adventurous options like pistachio and blood orange, there was a flavor for every palate. The freshness and quality of the ingredients were evident in each spoonful, and the creamy texture was simply divine.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the presentation. Each scoop of gelato was skillfully shaped and placed in a pristine dish, making it almost too beautiful to eat. The small nuances, like the chocolate shavings delicately sprinkled on top or the perfectly replicated fruit swirls, added an extra touch of elegance.

The service at Frost Gelato was top-notch. The staff was knowledgeable about the flavors and gladly provided recommendations based on my preferences. They patiently allowed me to sample a few flavors before making my final decision, ensuring that I found the perfect combination. I also appreciated that they took the time to explain the ingredients and the process behind their gelato.

The only reason I am not giving a full 5-star rating is because the seating area is a bit limited, and it can get crowded during peak hours. However, this did not significantly impact my overall experience.

In conclusion, Frost Gelato is a gem of a place for gelato lovers. The flavors are delectable, the presentation is impeccable, and the service is excellent. I highly recommend visiting if you are in the area and in need of a sweet treat.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

"I recently visited the Tampa International Airport on a work trip to Tampa from Las Vegas. My arrival and departure was through Southwest.

My initial arrival into Tampa International Airport was at 1:00 A.M. It was completely empty. There were only 2 other carriers arriving at 1:00 A.M from different cities in the U.S. The place was spotless and there were no open stores at the time.

I was able to exit the International Airport relatively easy from the terminal. You take a tram over to the main exit, baggage claim area. I did a rideshare the entire time while I was in Tampa. Finding the location for Uber/Lift was relatively easy. It shares the same terminal pick-up as generic taxis. It was a smooth arrival into Tampa International Airport.

My departure was slightly different. A work colleague had decided to drop me off. Our original input into our google map's didn't initially lead us into the correct route to Tampa International Airport. We ended up remediating and selected a different route. You had to pay attention to which carrier you're departing on. TPA chooses different color schemes ""Red or Blue"" depending on the carrier you selected. I was departing with Southwest.

Finding the gate was a little different in a crowded airport than arriving into TPA on a 1:00 A.M arrival. I had finally found the C Gate, but noticed something very different than most airports that I have flown in the U.S. There is a security check even before going through TSA. You have to provide your ID and airfare pass to the security guards before going on the tram to the C gate.

Once arrived at the C gate from Tram, you then go through TSA. It was a relatively quick check-in process. I wish I could get this place a 5 out of 5, but there really is a limited amount of food selections and the women's bathroom's were really dirty.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

When we went on Wednesday night it was busy and we got one of the last tables. The service was excellent. Our waitress was speedy but also very friendly. We tried the trio appetizer. The salsa was okay, the queso was pretty good, and the guacamole was excellent, some of the best I've ever had.

For entrees I got a quesadilla and my husband got two tacos. We both loved our food. Since it was our first visit we got free dessert, some churros in ice cream. The dessert was the only part that didn't wow us, but luckily it was free, which is always nice.

The only minor complaint I had was the noise level. It's really loud and we had to yell the entire time we were there. Even then I couldn't hear half of what my husband was saying. Who knows, maybe I'm just getting old.

For the main course, the Lamb Rogan Josh was a masterpiece of tender, slow-cooked lamb bathed in a richly-spiced tomato-cream sauce that was both hearty and sophisticated. The aromatic Basmati rice served alongside was a fragrant foundation, making each bite a harmonious balance of spices and succulence.

The highlight, however, was the Malabar Prawn Curry. The prawns were cooked to perfection, their natural sweetness enhanced by the coconut milk-based sauce that bore whispers of mustard seeds and curry leaves. It was a dish that demanded pause and respect with every spoonful.

No detail was too small for the attentive staff, who expertly navigated the balance between attentiveness and discretion, ensuring that our glasses were never empty and our preferences catered to. Even when the restaurant hummed with patrons, their service did not falter.

Finishing with a velvety Gulab Jamun, served warm with a sprinkle of pistachio dust, was the perfect endnote to the symphony of flavors. Coriander Indian Bistro didn't just serve a meal; it delivered an experience that was sublime and memorable. A true five-star gem, it's essential for anyone seeking to savor the art of Indian gastronomy at its finest.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Dining at Morimoto was an exquisite experience deserving of a Michelin star. From the moment we were greeted, the service was impeccable. The interior married modern with classic Japanese aesthetics, creating a serene atmosphere. We indulged in the seasonal omakase, which was a parade of flavors. Each dish, from the toro tartare to the black cod miso, was a culinary masterpiece, marrying traditional techniques with innovative presentations. The sake pairing elevated the meal, with each sip complementing the delicate flavors of the courses. Even the desserts were transcendent, offering a graceful end to a perfect gastronomic ballet. It was a splurge, but worth every penny for such an unforgettable dinner. #MorimotoMagic",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Mi Nidito Restaurant is a hidden gem tucked away on a side street in Tucson. From the moment I walked in, I knew I was in for a treat. Despite the restaurant being crowded, I only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The service, although slightly slow due to the busyness, was still attentive and friendly.

The seating in Mi Nidito Restaurant is quite close together, so if you're looking for a private or intimate dining experience, this may not be the best option. However, the cozy atmosphere adds to the charm of the place.

Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the Green Chili Enchiladas, and they were out of this world. The green chilies packed a flavorful punch that I rarely find in California restaurants. The enchiladas were perfectly cheesy and absolutely delicious. I wish I could have eaten 100 of them!

In addition to the enchiladas, the chicken in my dish was moist and flavorful. The chips were crispy, and the salsa had just the right amount of kick. The overall dining experience was delightful, and I left with a happy and satisfied stomach.

The restaurant also scores points for cleanliness, with clean and well-maintained restrooms.

Mi Nidito Restaurant impressed me with its delicious food, friendly service, and cozy ambiance. I will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Tucson. The only downside was a slightly longer wait time for the food, but it was well worth it.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Mi Nidito Restaurant for anyone craving authentic and mouthwatering Mexican cuisine. This was, by far, my favorite meal in Tucson. With 5 stars out of 5, Mi Nidito Restaurant has earned its place as one of my top dining experiences.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

It is probably one of the more expensive restaurants in New Orleans so I don't go frequently but every time I've been it has been a very enjoyable experience.

"Harry & Izzy's is a gem of a restaurant that exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I stepped through the door, I felt welcomed and taken care of. The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, with a touch of elegance that made it the perfect spot for a special occasion or a memorable dinner.

The service at Harry & Izzy's was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly. Our server went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was nothing short of extraordinary. They were happy to answer all our questions, offered insightful recommendations, and anticipated our needs before we even had to ask. It was truly refreshing to be treated with such care and professionalism.

Now let's talk about the food. Every dish we ordered was an absolute delight, showcasing the culinary expertise of the kitchen staff. The menu had a fantastic variety of options, from seafood to steak, and everything in between. The flavors were bold and well-balanced, and the presentation was as beautiful as the taste. The portion sizes were generous, leaving us satisfied but not overly stuffed. We couldn't help but savor every bite.

One standout dish was the Jack's New York Strip, cooked to perfection. The steak was tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. The accompanying truffle butter added an extra touch of richness that took the dish to a whole new level. We also indulged in the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, which were a true seafood delight. The crab cakes were moist and flavorful, with just the right amount of seasoning. The dish was beautifully presented, and the tangy remoulade sauce complemented the crab cakes perfectly.

To finish off our incredible dining experience, we couldn't resist trying the Signature St. Elmo's Shrimp Cocktail. The shrimp were plump and succulent, and the sauce had the perfect amount of kick to it. It was a fabulous combination of flavors that left us wanting more.

The overall ambiance of Harry & Izzy's was sophisticated yet relaxed. The soft lighting and charming decor created a cozy and inviting atmosphere, making us feel right at home. The restaurant also offered a great selection of wines and cocktails, which paired perfectly with the meal.

In conclusion, Harry & Izzy's is a culinary gem that offers an exceptional dining experience. With outstanding service, delicious food, and a warm and inviting atmosphere, it's no wonder why this restaurant is a favorite among locals and visitors alike. I would highly recommend Harry & Izzy's to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. My time here was nothing short of perfect, and I cannot wait to return.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"I'm about to do something I never thought I'd do. *deep breath* I'm about to write a five-star review for a business I haven't yet visited. I KNOW! *gasp*

I'm going to visit Sunflower, rest assured. I've got an appointment and everything. But Rachel, the owner and massage therapist, has already provided such fantabulous customer service that I just had to share it with you all NOW.

One of the gifts I'm offering up for The Boy's birthday is a massage. Yeah, I know, I'm like the best girlfriend ever. I trolled through Yelp reviews like a fiend and consulted pampering lists by Stephanie S., Christine F., Sarah S. and Aimee K., trying to find the perfect place for his first and much-needed massage experience. After reviewing the Yelp stuff and corresponding websites and locations, I decided that Sunflower sounded like the best option. 

I called and left a voicemail for Rachel, explaining my birthday idea and asking about availability for a certain date. Rachel called me back within 10 minutes and apologized profusely for not being available when I had called, which was super sweet. She loved the idea of giving a massage as a birthday gift and sharing in the experience together, and she suggested that I book my and The Boy's appointments via her online scheduler thing. I then asked about payment, and she said that most clients pay after their massage session. I asked if I could pay her before that, so that The Boy didn't get any crazy ideas and jump in to try to pay. Rachel is now working with me to accept my credit card payment before the appointment so that The Boy doesn't have to see or even sense any of the payment stuff. SO AWESOME! 

So I booked our appointments online, and we were able to schedule The Boy and me back to back (Rachel is the sole therapist, so there's no couple's massage or concurrent massage with separate therapists. Also, the term ""couples massage"" sort of weirds me out and makes me giggle.).  I immediately received an automatic confirmation of our appointments, plus Rachel followed up personally to say that everything was set and that both massages would receive her introductory rate since we were both new customers ($45 for 60 minutes? Good grief, that's awesome!). Seriously, I already feel pampered and am so excited for this. If Rachel's massages are as wonderful as her customer service, she's just earned a customer or two for a loooooong time.

"I recently dined at Ritz Camera, and I must say, it was quite an enjoyable experience. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was welcoming and cozy, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.

The staff at Ritz Camera were friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout the evening. They were knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations, ensuring that our dining experience was elevated. The waitstaff was attentive without being intrusive, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a comfortable pace.

Speaking of the meal, the food at Ritz Camera was simply delicious. From the appetizers to the desserts, each dish was crafted with precision and attention to detail. I particularly loved the flavors in the starters, which offered a range of options to suit different palates. The main course was equally impressive, with generous portions and beautiful presentation. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the flavors were well-balanced.

The highlight of my dining experience at Ritz Camera, however, was the dessert. The restaurant had an extensive dessert menu, and it was difficult to choose just one. Eventually, I settled on a decadent chocolate mousse that melted in my mouth. It was a delightful end to an already fantastic meal.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ritz Camera, there were a couple of minor issues that prevented me from giving it a perfect rating. Firstly, the noise level in the restaurant was a bit higher than I would have preferred, making it occasionally difficult to hold a conversation. Additionally, while the food was undoubtedly delicious, some dishes felt a bit lacking in creativity and uniqueness.

Overall, I would highly recommend Ritz Camera for a delightful dining experience. With its friendly staff, delicious food, and cozy ambiance, it is a restaurant that is well worth a visit. I would certainly return in the future to try more of their mouthwatering dishes.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"French food? In Nashville?  I'm down.  I only wish I wasn't preggers so I could have sampled some of the more traditional French menu items at Table 3. Goat's cheese tart? Yum! Steak tartar with egg yolk? Yes please! Cheese board?  Okay, yer killing me over here.  

In the end, I opted for the ridiculously safe, fully cooked, herb dijon roasted chicken with a lemon chicken stock reduction, garlic spinach and potato puree.  As I sat and waited for my ever boring chicken to arrive, I totally had order remorse.  I saw the folks around me enjoying their super French-y dishes and my mouth was watering. 

Then, the chicken was set in front of me.  Holy Toledo!  This chicken was insane! Juicy, perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth delicious.  It was served on top of a mixture of the spinach and potatoes.  Is it possible for spinach and potatoes to outshine this chicken?  Ummmm....it kind of did.  Had I not been dining with my boss, and had there not been other people in the restaurant, I totally would have licked the remnants off my plate.  It was freaking outstanding.  

I've already prepared myself for the return trip to Nashville after the bambino is born.  This time, I a prepared to try all those menu items I wasn't able to the first time around.  Table 3 is definitely a winner.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I went to Cafe A La Cart to meet a group of women during the workweek. I put the address into my navigation system and while it wasn't quite right- the signage outside was enough to help me find the location. 

Nestled in downtown Tucson, the location is pristine. There are plenty of seating choices- inside or outside and the patio is absolutely beautiful with lights. When I was there on a Wednesday, a really great band was playing outside where we were sitting. The sound level was great- I could enjoy the band and still chat with the group I was with. 

Our waitress was also great- she was attentive and knowledgeable regarding the menu. I opted for a salad- there are a few vegetarian options to choose from which was great. 

When my salad came out- the presentation was gorgeous. The lettuce was crisp and overall it was delicious. The best part? A large variety of desserts to choose from. If you haven't been- definitely check it out.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Very cool ""locals'"" spot certainly worth a try!

I don't come to this part of town often, though would argue that it's easily the heart of downtown SB. When I do find myself over in this neighborhood, I try and make an effort to patronize this spot. 

Walking in here is a treat. The Pickle Room has more of a lounge-y, relaxed vibe which is a nice break from the bustle of the other bars in the area. The dimly lit room and nostalgic decor bring you back to an era of simpler times and true blue cocktails. Places like this aren't all too common in our town. 

Whenever I do come here, I HAVE to order their signature Pickle Back shot, which is essentially a healthy pouring of Jameson Whiskey accompanied by an equally as healthy shot of pickle juice! The practice is to shoot the Jameson and then chase it down with the pickle juice. Sounds like a weird pairing, but it actually works well! A must try in my opinion.

"The British Chip Shop is an absolute gem hidden within the city. From the moment I walked in, the warm and inviting atmosphere captured my attention. The decor, with its British-inspired accents, felt charming and authentic.

I was greeted by friendly staff who promptly seated me. The menu boasted a variety of traditional British dishes, but I couldn't resist trying their famous fish and chips. I was promptly served with a beautifully presented plate of golden, crispy chips and a perfectly cooked fish fillet. The fish was tender, and the chip's outer layer had a delightful crunch. It was evident that the ingredients were of top-notch quality.

What truly stood out was the attention given to the customization of each dish. The British Chip Shop offers an extensive array of sauces to accompany your meal, ranging from classic tartare to tangy curry sauces. The staff was more than happy to recommend pairings and made sure my preferences were met.

Moreover, the service was exceptional throughout my visit. The staff's knowledge and passion for their offerings were evident in their attentive and efficient service. They made me feel welcomed and valued as a customer.

The portion sizes were generous, leaving me satisfied, yet craving more. Considering the reasonable prices, this experience felt like an excellent value for money. To complete my meal, I indulged myself in a comforting cup of English Breakfast tea, putting a perfect end note to a delightful dining experience.

Overall, my experience at The British Chip Shop was nothing short of five stars. The combination of authentic British flavors, impeccable service, and inviting atmosphere created an unforgettable experience. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for a taste of Britain within the city.

The atmosphere and space was gorgeous and fancy, with a three piece band playing in the dining room. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed with the food, as I was with the space. The menu was expensive, and by glancing around the room, the portions were small. I ordered the crawfish and cheese crepes. However, it was cheese crepes, with crawfish pieces in the sauce on top. My friends' dishes were not any more impressive. Perhaps all three of us ordered poorly? I will say that the service was wonderful, and the band made us all smile.

"This place kind of grows on you.  I thought at first that they were fairly bad at customer service.  

However, as I have eaten at more Sushi restaurants, the Sushi here is not that bad...actually, it's pretty tasty.  The lady that greets you one of the owners I am sure has cozied up to me a bit.

Perhaps it just takes Asian personalities more time to feel more comfortable around a person, especially a dark skinned fella as myself.  

I have up their rating a bit as compared to one other well known Sushi place, this one is better than the well known Sushi restaurant to me.  The customer service has improved towards the dark skinned persuasion as myself and she actually laughed with me today.

I ordered​ the real Sushi this time, and the flavors were good, still pricey to me, but maybe Sushi prices have went up.  

I say give them a try, don't make that first visit your last visit, it may take two or three visits, then the owners will start to love you no matter who you are.  I guess they appreciate loyalty more before they trust you with kindness.

"Review: My experience at The Rutledge was incredibly disappointing. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere felt cold and unwelcoming. The staff seemed disinterested and lacked any sense of hospitality. 

The menu was limited, and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the steak, and it was overcooked and tough to chew. The vegetables that accompanied it were bland and lacked any flavor. It was clear that no effort was put into the preparation or presentation of the dishes.

The service was slow and inefficient. It took forever for our orders to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive at our table. To make matters worse, the staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, leading to numerous mistakes with our orders.

The prices were exorbitant, considering the poor quality of the food and service. I felt like I was being ripped off for the subpar experience I had. Even the ambiance of the restaurant was lacking, with dim lighting and outdated decor.

Overall, I would not recommend The Rutledge to anyone. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that offer better food, service, and value for money. Save yourself the disappointment and choose another dining option.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"It has been a few months since I was last at the 13th Street Pub and I love their bacon wrapped dates and cocktail service. Alas, the dates were no longer on the menu so we had to go to plan ""B"".

We secured a spot at the high top gas fire pit and ordered the shrimp and grit appetizer. This appetizer was served in deep fried, breaded Burger King French Toast Stick fashion, not the traditional shrimp on top of ladled on girts with a smooth mouth feel.The white cheddar fondue was a cold, thin dip that more resembled watered down Ranch dressing and if the menu had not described what it was, I would have had no idea it was white cheddar.  It was a complete disappointment. 

I ordered the surf and turf entree and the Snake River sirloin was nicely cooked to order and had good taste, but other American Waygu was not as tender as other Snake River Farms sirloins that I have had at other establishments.

The highlights of the experience were the service which was attentive despite being very busy, the cocktail pours were nicely generous, the grilled shishito peppers were warm, salty and just right. Lastly the real high point of the meal were the salads which were piled high with a fresh mixture of field greens and nuts.

Despite the lows, the highs still garner this pub a solid 4 stars.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I had dinner at Meril with the hubs and a couple of friends last night and loved it!

First of all, I was surprised at how big this place is.  As you walk in, you are facing a pretty large bar, where lots of unique concoctions are served. Their cocktail menu lists several drinks by number, which I thought was a pretty cool idea. I had the #11, which was made with lavender syrup and Vodka; It was sweet and refreshing. My husband had a vodka tonic and I think he liked his drink as well - it didn't last long.

We were seated in the large dining room, and it was obvious right away that this is a fun place. It was a little on the loud side, but that's what we were hoping for. Everyone seemed to be smiling, laughing, and chatting it up. 

Our waiter was very attentive and seemed genuinely happy to help us navigate the menu, since it was our first visit.  Also, I really dig the way the staff wears butcher style aprons. Nice touch.

The menu is made up of small plates, although there was a menu of daily specials that listed a couple of larger dishes.  We were looking forward to tapas so we stuck with the small plates. 

The waiter suggested that we order 2-3 dishes per person and we decided on 7 dishes total, and felt that we all had plenty to eat. 

We had: Tuna cups - amazing 
               Candied ribs - fell off the bone and so tasty
               Roasted oysters - meh
               Mexican corn - OMG! Sooo good!
               Pork belly - very good but not great
               Chicken Livers - a must try, food from my youth - made me want to call my mom
                Brussels sprouts - yummy

*Side note about how cool their wait staff and policies are - A couple of the dishes came with only three portions. When we placed our order, the waiter let us know that he would have an extra portion added to those to accommodate all 4 of us.

I ordered a cup of she crab soup and was impressed. My husband even liked it, and he usually acts as though soups are his kryptonite.

For dessert I had the pecan pie. The filling was delicious, but the crust was a little tough.  Even so, I wasn't deterred. It was still a stellar slice of pie and it's just not in my nature to turn my back on something so dreamy.  Yes, I love pecan pie.

"This is my third visit to Vivo and each experience has been slightly different.   Consistency would bring this restaurant to 5 stars for me.  I have observed significant variation in the preparation of the caprese salad to the point that I actually need to ask if they have all of the ingredients. Also I find great variability in the style and quality of the wait staff.  That said the food at Vivo is some of the best Italian in Edmonton.

What I really enjoy about Vivo is the family style menu. As a table of four or more you can try several different items. We shared a caprese salad, fettucini tossed in several cheeses and butter, mushroom risotto, beef tenderloin and a side plate of beets and carrots.  The caprese was good with its unique use of semi dried tomatoes, but lacked the gooey buffalo mozzarella cheese I experience the first time I visited the restaurant.  Three visits, three distinctly different caprese salads.

"Tavern on Camac boasts a quaint charm, with its dim lighting and rustic decor adding to the ambiance. As a mid-tier establishment, I approached with moderate expectations. The menu, though not expansive, included a mix of comforting classics and a few intriguing specials. Service was attentive, if not exceptional.

While the appetizers were satisfactory—the crispy calamari stood out—the main courses lacked the refinement promised by their description. My steak was cooked a notch past my request, and the accompanying vegetables felt uninspired. The saving grace was a well-executed crème brûlée, its caramelized top giving way to a perfectly silky custard.

The atmosphere teetered on the lively side, which complemented the casual dining experience but occasionally bordered on clamorous. This made nuanced conversation a bit of a challenge.

Overall, Tavern on Camac is a serviceable spot for a casual meal. It doesn't rise to culinary prominence, but it doesn't entirely disappoint either. Solidly average, hence the 3-star rating.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Review: My experience at D1 the Factory was absolutely fantastic! I would give it 5 stars without hesitation. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the modern and trendy atmosphere. The industrial decor gave the restaurant a unique and edgy vibe.

The service was impeccable. The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They provided excellent recommendations and made sure that all of our needs were met. Our food arrived promptly and was beautifully presented.

Speaking of the food, it was outstanding. The menu offered a wide variety of options, and everything we ordered was delicious. Each dish was expertly prepared with fresh ingredients and flavorful seasonings. The flavors were well-balanced, and the portion sizes were generous.

One standout dish was the Factory signature burger. It was juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The combination of toppings, including caramelized onions and melted cheese, elevated the burger to another level. It was accompanied by crispy fries that were the perfect accompaniment.

The drink selection was equally impressive. The bartender crafted creative and refreshing cocktails that perfectly complemented our meals. The wine list was extensive, offering a great selection from various regions.

The overall ambiance of the restaurant was energetic and vibrant. The music was upbeat, but not overpowering, creating a lively atmosphere without hindering conversation. The dim lighting and comfortable seating added to the overall enjoyment of the dining experience.

The pricing was reasonable considering the high quality of the food, service, and ambience. The value for money was definitely there, and I would gladly return to D1 the Factory for another memorable dining experience.

In conclusion, D1 the Factory is a must-visit restaurant. The exceptional food, attentive service, and trendy atmosphere make it a standout choice. Whether you're looking for a casual lunch or a special dinner, this restaurant has it all. I highly recommend D1 the Factory and will definitely be returning.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

They bring out a bunch of food while you're waiting for what you ordered to be delivered.  We've been often enough to have figured out that we prefer the coleslaw made with mayonnaise to the coleslaw made with vinegar.  I've also discovered that I'm a big fan of their pepper jelly with the okra, white beans and even the hush puppies.  

My fried catfish was delicious.  My wife had the Cajan-grilled scallops and really liked them.  My daughter had the Cajun catfish and loved it.  I tried it, and it was OK, but I preferred my catfish.  None of us left hungry, although we did bring pie home.  The chocolate pie was pretty good, but the coconut pie was exceptional.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I'm surprised at the ratings as I had a great experience at this location. The name alone attracted me to see what they had going on inside.  It's located in the heart of New Orleans where it's within walking distance to/from Burbon St and French Quarters.

I came on a weekday morning so I was only one of two customers present. I believe you are able to seat yourself but it could've been that service was a little slow.  Nevertheless, the bar attendant greeted me upon walking in and gave me the option of dining at the bar or table. It's a really cute restaurant with a small outdoor sidewalk eating area. Very petite and cute.  I believe it's a restaurant that's part of a hotel.

The menu options were diverse and exciting, offering a mix of classic dishes with a modern twist. Each dish we ordered was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.

"I recently dined at the East Buffet Restaurant and unfortunately, my experience was disappointing to say the least. From the moment I walked in, the overall ambiance was lackluster and uninviting. The restaurant felt outdated and in need of some serious renovation.

Moving onto the service, it was nothing short of poor. The waitstaff seemed disinterested and it was difficult to get their attention. When we finally managed to order our drinks, they took an eternity to arrive. The server seemed overwhelmed and they lacked basic knowledge about the menu items when we asked for recommendations.

Now let's talk about the food. The buffet spread was extensive, but the quality of the dishes was far from satisfying. The sushi selection was subpar, with stale and tasteless rolls. The hot dishes were lukewarm, lacking flavor, and seemed to have been sitting out for an extended period. I noticed that some of the dishes were not labeled, leaving me unsure of what I was eating.

To make matters worse, the cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. The tables were sticky and the floors seemed like they hadn't been properly cleaned in ages. The overall hygiene of the place was questionable, adding to the disappointment of the experience.

In terms of value for money, I feel that East Buffet Restaurant falls short. The prices were not reflective of the quality of food or service. It was evident that corners were being cut, and it was quite disheartening.

Overall, I cannot recommend East Buffet Restaurant based on my experience. The lackluster ambiance, poor service, lack of cleanliness, and subpar food quality make it a place to be avoided. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a more enjoyable dining experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"From the moment I stepped into Bombay Palace Restaurant, I was enveloped by the warm, inviting ambiance that promised a delightful dining experience. Upon being seated, the attentive and courteous staff made certain that my visit was nothing short of excellent from start to finish.

The menu, a lavish spread of authentic Indian cuisine, presented a challenge only in choosing from the myriad of mouthwatering dishes. I decided to start with the Paneer Tikka, which was an absolute delight, with its perfectly seasoned and grilled paneer cubes ensuring that each bite was a burst of flavor.

For my main course, the Lamb Rogan Josh was an impeccable choice. The lamb was tender, succulent, and cooked to perfection, enveloped in a robust and aromatic sauce that hinted at a masterful blend of spices. Accompanying the dish, the garlic naan was the perfect vessel for savoring every last drop of the sauce—soft, fluffy, and with just the right amount of char.

No meal at Bombay Palace Restaurant is complete without indulging in their signature dessert—Gulab Jamun. Warm, sweet, and decadently syrupy, these heavenly spheres were the crowning glory of an already exceptional meal.

The fusion of an enchanting atmosphere, exceptional culinary creations, and impeccable service at Bombay Palace Restaurant scored a well-deserved five stars in my book. It’s a haven for those who savor the true essence of Indian gastronomy, and I left with not only a satisfied palate but also memories of a meal that was nothing short of extraordinary.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The menu was a revelation - a perfect blend of innovation and comfort. The appetizers set a high bar; the Charcuterie Board was a mosaic of flavors with its array of cured meats, cheeses, and a delightful honeycomb that danced on the palate. Each dish was presented as a work of art, commanding both awe and appetite.

The star of the evening, however, was the main course. A perfectly seared steak that was the epitome of tenderness and taste. It was complemented by a symphony of sides that were both simple and decadent, creating a blissful balance on the plate.

Dessert was not an afterthought but a crowning glory – a deconstructed chocolate torte that was both rich and airy. The playful texture contrast and the just-right sweetness exemplified the creativity and care put into each dish.

Service at Commoner & Co. was impeccable, with a knowledgeable and attentive staff that guided my dining choices with expert ease.

The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They made excellent recommendations, helping me navigate through the extensive selection of delicious dishes. Every dish was served with a smile, and the staff ensured that all our needs were met throughout the meal.

Now, let's talk about the food. Casa Mexico knocked it out of the park! Starting with the appetizers, the guacamole was freshly made and bursting with flavors. The salsa trio was a delightful combination of tangy, spicy, and smoky flavors, perfectly complementing the warm tortilla chips. I also tried the Mexico City quesadillas, which were stuffed with savory fillings, beautifully melted cheese, and served with a zesty dipping sauce. Each bite was a burst of flavor!

The main course was equally impressive. I tried the carne asada, and it was cooked to perfection. The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. The accompanying sides of rice and refried beans were authentic and tasted homemade. The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling more than satisfied.

To top it all off, the dessert selection at Casa Mexico was divine. I indulged in the churros, which were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The deep-fried dough was coated in cinnamon sugar and served with a rich, velvety chocolate sauce. It was a heavenly end to an already phenomenal meal.

Overall, Casa Mexico deserves a solid 5-star rating. The combination of a welcoming atmosphere, exceptional service, and mouthwatering food made for an unforgettable dining experience.

"My dining experience at Shang Hai 1 was an exquisite journey through the bold flavors of authentic Shanghai cuisine. The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was enveloped by an ambiance that elegantly blended traditional Chinese elements with modern sophistication, setting the stage for the culinary excellence that awaited.

The service was impeccable from the start. Attentive without being intrusive, the staff anticipated every need, guiding us through the menu with expert recommendations. We began with a cold appetizer of drunken chicken, which was succulent and perfectly infused with Shaoxing wine, offering a delicate balance of flavors that excited the palate.

For the main courses, each dish seemed to outdo the last. The highlight was undoubtedly the Sheng Jian Bao - pan-fried pork buns with a delectable golden-brown crust giving way to wonderfully juicy meat and richly flavored broth inside. Dim sum classics like the siu mai and har gow were expertly crafted, their thin wrappers revealing generous fillings of finely minced meat and fresh, plump shrimp.

The magic of the meal continued with a serving of their signature Shanghai braised pork belly. The meat was tender to the point of melting in the mouth, complemented by a sweet and savory glaze that was heavenly.

To cleanse the palate, a refreshing Jasmine tea was served between dishes, its floral notes adding to the sense of indulgence. Each bite at Shang Hai 1 was a taste of the authentic, refined flavors of Shanghai, leaving no question as to why this place earns all five stars in my book.

The restaurant itself had a chic and trendy feel, with modern decor and an open layout that allowed for a lively ambiance. The dim lighting and cozy seating created an intimate dining experience that was perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends.

The service at SoBou deserves special mention. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Our waiter was able to recommend the perfect cocktail to start off our evening, and his enthusiasm for the food was contagious. He took the time to explain each dish, its ingredients, and preparation, making us feel like we were embarking on a culinary adventure.

Speaking of the food, let me just say, it was outstanding. SoBou prides itself on serving ""South of Bourbon Street"" cuisine, and boy, did they deliver. Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. From the Louisiana cochon de lait to the crawfish cornbread and the Gulf shrimp and corn bisque, each bite was a taste sensation. The use of local, fresh ingredients was evident in every dish and added an extra layer of authenticity to the experience.

I couldn't leave without mentioning the highlight of the meal - the desserts. Oh my goodness, the desserts at SoBou are something special. We indulged in the chocolate bread pudding and the praline beignets, and let me tell you, they were out of this world.

"Manayunk Brewery is one of those brews that I have enjoyed several times in can form and have been meaning to pay a visit to for awhile. So when I found myself visiting the area a little more frequently it became the first spot on my list to visit. And after a couple of visits I can definitely call it a full package brewery that has a lot to offer!

Upon entry my first impression was noting how freaking huge the Brewery is. But in this case that adds up to a lot of perfect bar arrangements that cater to any patron, whether they prefer grabbing a stool at a massive bar, lounging in a booth with multiple friends, grabbing a center table for a date, or standing to watch the big game on a projector screen!! They even have a mini-store for picking up merchandise and limited release beers, and plenty of room for private parties!

In most breweries when you see 10+ beers on tap it becomes pretty difficult to choose that perfect brew. But since Manayunk has an extraordinary deal that allows you to order a flight of ALL THE BEERS, that problem is pretty easily eliminated. It's also given me plenty of opportunity to relive old favorites like Monk From The Yunk, try new favorites like the Sir Dank A-Lot triple IPA, and gave me an easier time of trying less appealing beers like their Mint Chocolate Chip Crunch Porter (just not my thing).

When looking through the menus the first two things I noticed was how freaking huge the main one was, and how out of place the secondary sushi menu seemed to be in a brewery. But after enjoying a few pieces of sashimi I can report that it somehow works. But I've also enjoyed offering like their southern fried chicken littles, the traditional Cuban sandwich w/ pulled pork and thinly sliced ham on Swiss, and their Kennet Square Pizza with all the mushrooms and goat cheese!

It is NOT where I would have a kids party - but surprisingly it all worked.  The adults had drinks and lots of fried-bad-for-you apps.

"My experience at Noodles & Company was less than satisfying. I entered the restaurant with high hopes, as I am a big fan of noodles and was excited to try their diverse menu. However, my expectations quickly turned into disappointment.

Firstly, the service was subpar. The waitstaff seemed disinterested and inattentive. It took them an unusually long time to take my order, and I had to repeatedly ask for refills on my drink. There was no effort made to check in with customers or ensure a pleasant dining experience.

Moving on to the food, it was mediocre at best. I ordered their signature dish, the Pad Thai, and it lacked flavor and authenticity. The noodles were bland, lacking any real texture or taste. The sauce was watery and didn't have the traditional balance of sweet, sour, and spicy. It was a major letdown.

In addition, the portion sizes were disappointingly small for the price. I left the restaurant still feeling hungry and unsatisfied. The value for money was simply not there.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was also lackluster. The interior felt drab and uninviting, with minimal effort put into decor or ambiance. It didn't provide the cozy, welcoming atmosphere I had hoped for.

I must admit that I was excited to try Noodles & Company, but my experience left much to be desired.

We started  with a appetizer of lentil cracker with pepper chutney that was a little spicy and the cracker very thin and crunchy.
I loved the bhaji, deep-fried onion pancake, fried and delicious.

Then this puffy bread called Poori came out and it was outrageous - it's oily and deep fried bread.  We also tried samosa a deep fried batter filled with peas and potatoes and yummy. 

We had two curry entrees, Makhani - shrimp in curry sauce, and 
Korma - lamb in curry sauce. Both were a little spicy and we wrapped them in the nan bread that made a great dinner!

We finished with some Indian rice pudding - very creamy and good!
I thoroughly enjoyed this Indian dinner and will go back to try more new entrees.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Embarking upon a serene experience at TeaStori, I was enveloped by an enchanting, welcoming atmosphere from the moment of entry. The exquisite fusion of traditional and modern decor set a perfect stage for the symphony of flavors that was to come. Each sip of their carefully crafted boba teas was a testament to the quality ingredients and meticulous attention to detail employed in their creation. Whether it was the richness of the almond milk-infused teas or the delightful burst of the tapioca pearls, every drink was a harmonious blend that danced on the taste buds.

The staff, with their impeccable knowledge and friendly demeanors, made the selection process a delightful journey rather than a daunting task. They proficiently guided my choices, ensuring that my dietary preferences were respected and celebrated with each recommendation.

While some may perceive it to be a touch on the pricier side, the value received in taste, ambiance, and service far surpasses that of the archetypal 'gourmet' drink establishment. TeaStori is not merely a place to grab a quick beverage; it is a destination that caters to the connoisseur within, promising a tranquil oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

In sum, my experience at TeaStori was nothing short of remarkable. It is unquestionably deserving of a full five-star rating, beckoning a swift return to indulge in the serene ritual of tea once more.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Union Public House is an interesting spot. Wednesday night is the time to go, with Whiskey Wednesdays offering half price on their extensive selection of whiskeys from all over the globe - a fun spot in St Phillip Plaza to try a few higher priced whiskeys at a low price.

If you are heading there on a Wednesday night, my tip is get there relatively early and try to leave by about 9:30pm. The early crowd is pretty laid back, working professionals popping in for a drink  in good company after work and sticking around to watch a game on the tvs. 

Later on Wednesday night the crowd changes to more of a mix of college students and people who should have left a few hours earlier. The music gets loud and it really reaches capacity, particularly inside.

One negative of Union Public House is that quite often, they don't have their more expensive bottles in stock. My friends and I speculate as to whether they're just out of stock, or they ""miraculously"" stock out on Wednesday nights.... wink wink. Either way, can't blame them, but perhaps keep the electronic menus up to date with which bottles are in stock.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Small Batch Soups by Soupremacy and I must say, it was an incredible experience. From start to finish, everything was top-notch and I can confidently give it a perfect 5-star rating.

Firstly, the staff at Small Batch Soups were friendly and accommodating. They went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was exceptional. Despite the fact that I had multiple expiring groupons, they handled each transaction efficiently and with a smile.

The menu at Small Batch Soups is varied and impressive. As a person with dairy allergies, I was pleased to find that they had numerous vegan and dairy-free options. The staff were knowledgeable and took great care in accommodating my dietary restrictions. However, I do wish that the soups were labeled to differentiate between cream-based and non-cream-based options, as it would have made it easier to identify the soups at home.

Now onto the star of the show: the food. I opted for a trio of soups, allowing me to sample all of the available options. Each soup was expertly crafted and bursting with flavor. The standout for me was the Tomato Bisque, topped with fresh gouda, which added a delightful depth to the dish. The Chicken Velvet was another favorite, rich and cheesy. I must say, however, the Lobster Bisque fell flat. It had a sour taste and lacked the promised lobster chunks. But overall, the soups were enjoyable, with the Onion Soup and Chicken Tortilla also receiving positive reviews from my fellow diners.

The sides also did not disappoint. The salads were fresh and tasty, although the avocado on the Kerouac could have been riper. The potato salad, although a bit pricey, was unique with its absence of mayo and the option to mix in blue cheese. And let's not forget about the Semolina bread from Amelia's bakery, which paired perfectly with the soup.

Small Batch Soups truly lived up to its name, offering a wide variety of delicious soups made with care and attention to detail. Despite the slight disappointment with the Lobster Bisque, the overall experience was outstanding. I highly recommend Small Batch Soups by Soupremacy to anyone looking for a fantastic soup experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Found another hidden gem in my lovely area of Lawrence! Porter books and bread is nestled in an old building of the Lawton Loop area. We met the owners, Marcy and will, on a previous night at the Lawrence farmers market, and were very excited to hear that their little coffee and sandwich shop was within walking distance to our house. On a nice Saturday afternoon, we walked over to try them out.

Porter boasts their own roasted blends (including a Kenya and a Papa New Guinea blend - - my personal favorite), as well as Mile Square coffee and Brickhouse coffee. You can even purchase locally dried looseleaf tea, homemade honey and vanilla extracts, and other locally produced goods.

My husband opted for their cold brew, while I snagged a cup of the Papa New Guinea. The folks here currently offer only French-pressed coffee, but will soon be able to make espresso drinks when their machine is up and running.

We also ordered off of their breakfast menu (offered all day long). I highly recommend the Karamazov- - a breakfast wrap with ham, bacon, fluffy eggs, and a delicious Sriracha Russian dressing. I'm telling you that dressing is really what makes the sandwich heavenly. Every sandwich comes with a nice, fresh piece of fruit on the side. The fruit du jour for us was a fresh kiwi.

And of course because they are a coffee shop, they have some yummy pastries to accompany your java. A peanut butter and chocolate scone was my choice, and it was heavenly (PB and chocolate are meant for each other in scone form.) My husband nabbed a decent-sized cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting on top... so worth the extra calories!

Don't forget that this place is a coffee shop with a small library of books for borrowing. I feel like this aspect of the business adds to the laid-back ambience, and gives them a unique selling point. I rather enjoyed that many of the tables upstairs were adorned with pages from various British authors.

Upon learning that they are open at 6 AM on weekdays, I fully intend to return on Monday to see about getting me a Machiatto before my morning commute.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"In an area where no strictly ""Hot Dog"" restaurant seems to make it, Super Gyros Chicago Dogs are good....and reasonably priced.
(Of course the best I've had were from a cart vendor in.... You guessed it Chicago!) 

The dog is I believe a Nathan's All Beef with Mustard,Onion,Relish,Clausen like dill pickle spear and Sport Peppers.

I've tried the fries and they were hot n tasty.
(Frozen/Not fresh Cut)

Their Ice cream is a quality brand from Wisconsin and is Very Good!

"It seems like you can't go anywhere in Reno without being more than a stone's throw away from a gym.  Price-wise - this gym is not the cheapest, but I don't think it's the most expensive either...

Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to how they like to work out, including me.  I was a member of this gym several years ago after purchasing a Groupon for a Boot Camp class, then I purchased a membership for a few months.  Life circumstances caused me to cancel my membership, but when I was ready to join a gym again, I had no hesitation to re-join South RAC.  The facilities are always clean, and never too crowded.  I prefer group classes, and I am pleased that they have added new classes since the last time I was a member.  They have a nice variety of classes, with a variety of teachers.

My husband is definitely bummed that they just removed the driving range, but we've heard rumors that they may add a golf component back in, which would be nice for the golfers.  I know that's one of the main reason my husband has been a member for so many years.

So yes, I know there is a $10 a month facility down the street, but I like South RAC, and don't plan on going anywhere else.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Loving the redone style, Vesper! 

Was very surprised that on a late Tuesday night, this place still had a live, talented artist playing and there was a decent amount of people inside. 

The drinks are...legit. So given that I am a recent college grad and am only recently developing a palette away from vodka in plastic handles, I was surprised. The martini, the manhattan, the cosmo, all legit. No frills, no fruity add-ons. Like Ron from Parks and Recs would probably love this place. While I might just opt for a fruity drink next time, I appreciate the vibe they have going and how they are true to their image.

"This restaurant will no doubt fill your craving for fried chicken! The chicken is perfectly crispy while still being very juicy and meaty. The flavor is great - they have really perfected their recipe. I got the 6 piece meal to share, which included 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 2 breasts plus 2 corn muffins. On top of delicious fried chicken, the corn muffin was amazing. Perfectly baked on top and moist on the inside.

The restaurant is small and you order at the counter. We had a group of 7 people and the stools and countertop was all taken when we got there, but with the 10-15 minute wait for them to make fresh food, space opened up and we were all able to grab seats. Amenities are all clean and staff were great! Definitely recommend this place if you want some great food!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At Hummusology, the warmth of Middle Eastern flavors embraces you like a cherished old friend. This cozy spot weaves a tapestry of creamy hummus varieties, each rich and well-seasoned, a clear testament to their craft. The Falafel's crispy exterior gives way to a tender, herbaceous heart—quite the textural delight. Accompanying the dish, a symphony of pickled vegetables and soft, fresh pita play supporting, yet significant roles. An unexpected standout was the Shakshuka, a harmonious meld of tomatoes and spices, with an egg poached to silken perfection. Service was friendly, adding a personal touch to the culinary journey. If I may yearn for more, it would be for a tad more zest in the lemonade, to cut through the robust meal. Nevertheless, Hummusology nearly perfects the balance of homestyle comfort and culinary expertise. It beckons for repeated exploration, each visit promising a new discovery in the artful world of hummus and beyond.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I recently dined at Ichiban Japanese Steak House and I must say, it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. I would give this restaurant a perfect 5-star rating without any hesitation.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the friendly staff and quickly seated at a cozy table. The ambiance was simply delightful, with its warm lighting and traditional Japanese decor. The restaurant was buzzing with activity, but it didn't feel crowded or overwhelming.

The menu at Ichiban is extensive, offering a wide array of authentic Japanese dishes. I opted for one of their famous hibachi meals, which turned out to be an unforgettable experience. The skillful chefs prepared the food right in front of me, showcasing impressive culinary techniques that were both entertaining and mouthwatering.

Not only was the presentation beautiful, but the taste of the food was exceptional. The hibachi meal included a tantalizing combination of perfectly grilled steak, chicken, and shrimp, accompanied by a medley of grilled vegetables and flavorful fried rice. Every bite was bursting with rich, savory flavors that left me wanting more.

To complement my meal, I ordered a traditional Japanese sake, recommended by the knowledgeable server. It was the perfect accompaniment, enhancing the flavors of the food and adding a delightful touch to the overall dining experience.

The service at Ichiban was top-notch. The staff was attentive, courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my dining experience was enjoyable. They were always ready to answer any questions and accommodate any special requests.

As for the price point, while it may be slightly higher than your average Japanese restaurant, the quality of the food and the overall experience are definitely worth it. I left Ichiban feeling satisfied, with a smile on my face and a desire to return soon.

In conclusion, Ichiban Japanese Steak House exceeded all of my expectations. The food was exceptional, the service was outstanding, and the overall atmosphere was inviting and lively. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic Japanese dining experience. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"The world needs more ice cream shops like Jeni's. The word Splendid in the title is definitely not an understatement but a very accurate representation of what to expect when you're coming to enjoy this delicious treat.
Jeni's has everything that a nice, small, cozy ice cream shop should have. Beautiful large windows to let in plenty of natural light, nice spacious seating area with white marble top tables to make your pictures Instagram worthy, and most importantly, absolutely magnificent ice cream and flavors that will keep you coming back for more. 

On a casual afternoon with friends, I decided to try three of their many appetizing sounding flavors. I had the Dark Chocolate, Lemon Juniper, and Pear Moscato. It was the perfect trio. The Dark Chocolate was bitter yet sweet just like any dark chocolate should be. Definitely the most traditional and classic flavor I've had but amazing! The Lemon Juniper was so refreshing and hit the spot on the warm, sunny day. Wonderfully tart and bright in flavor. My favorite was probably the Pear Moscato. It was sour and sweet in the most amazing way imaginable. Tasted almost exactly like a moscato in an ice cream form which is a dream come true. I really loved every single one and wish I tried even more flavors. Looks like all their fun creations are absolutely worth it. 

Staff was very nice and helpful, no complaints there at all. They offered samples of flavors which is so useful if you're as indecisive as I am and explained ingredients and stories behind the creation of the flavors I was interested in. Really amazing experience here; would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun, clean, not-so-classic ice cream shop. I'm slightly glad I don't live in Nashville because I would be visiting Jeni's way too often!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"DeSano Pizza Bakery is a hidden gem that I recently stumbled upon, and I am so glad I did. I have to say, my experience was nothing short of extraordinary, which is why I am giving it a perfect 5-star rating.

First and foremost, let's talk about the food. Oh my goodness, the pizza here is out of this world. With each bite, I could taste the passion and expertise that went into making it. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the crust was to die for – crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. It truly reminded me why I believe in a higher power.

One thing I appreciated about DeSano Pizza Bakery is that they stick to their authentic recipes and don't offer a lot of modifications. This shows their commitment to staying true to their craft and delivering the best possible product. I also loved the communal seating arrangement, which added to the relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

Another highlight of my visit was the oil bar. Yes, you read that right – an oil bar. I had so much fun creating my own flavor combinations with the various infused olive oils. The red pepper-infused olive oil particularly blew my mind. It added an extra kick to the already fantastic pizza.

Although I didn't have a chance to try the cannoli, I heard they are made in-house, so I highly recommend giving them a try. And don't forget to bring your mini bottles of Sutter Home wine – DeSano Pizza Bakery is totally cool with that!

I do want to mention that the service at DeSano Pizza Bakery was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and clearly passionate about what they do. The authentic Italian hospitality added an extra layer of warmth to my dining experience.

I would like to conclude by saying, if you're a pizza lover like me, you owe it to yourself to visit DeSano Pizza Bakery. It's truly a slice of heaven. And don't forget to bring some cash to tip the valet – they deserve a little extra appreciation for making the whole experience even more convenient.

Overall, my experience at DeSano Pizza Bakery was nothing short of spectacular. It has become my go-to pizzeria, and I can't wait to return for another delicious meal.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few

"At Yakitori Boy, expectations and reality played a bit of tug-of-war during my recent visit. The ambiance was fittingly casual for an izakaya-style establishment, bustling with conversation and the clink of glasses—certain cozy corners even promised an intimate dining experience.

As we perused the menu, the extensive offerings of skewered meats and sushi options piqued our interest—an invitation to a culinary journey through izakaya fare. Attentive at first, our server guided us through the selection with patient explanations, making a commendable effort to elevate our dining experience.

We started with a variety of yakitori, from the succulent yakitori negima (chicken and scallion skewers) to the risky but rewarding atsuage (fried tofu). Each skewer was grilled to a smoky perfection, the chicken tender, and the tofu surprisingly flavorful. The sushi, though fresh, did not break new ground in terms of flavor or presentation—satisfactory but falling short of remarkable.

Where the meal faltered was in pacing; the tapas-style dishes arrived in a disjointed rhythm, sometimes leaving us awaiting our next bite. Moreover, while none of the dishes disappointed overtly, none left a lasting impression, either.

At the heart of it, Yakitori Boy stands as a solid choice for a casual night out. However, when it comes to value, the pricing felt a touch steep compared to other spots in the city offering similar fare. It's this gap between cost and the overall food experience that holds back my rating.

Would the lure of evening karaoke tempt me back? Perhaps. But for the dining alone, this visit lands a comfortable if not entirely enthusiastic three stars.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I checked the Wxyz bar on it's grand opening afternoon/night. The atmosphere inside was nice, modern, and upbeat. It is located within the new Aloft hotel and reminded me of a mini vegas-esque hotel in Tucson, which is a nice change from the norm. The drinks were not too shabby, I got an aged dark rum to sip on, not too steep of a price either.

That all said, the outside area was not my favorite. 

1. The patio furniture is cheap and the chairs were broken and unusable on the first night. They look cool and modern, but are of a very poor quality.

2. You cannot smoke outside. I am not a big smoker, but everyone in a while I like to enjoy a cigar or a cigarette (maybe once every few months.) That said, they have a strict no smoking policy, which may disappoint many potential patrons.

3. The lighting is miserable. Bugs are attracted to all of the really cool looking glowing cubes of light, but tend to get smashed by menus and drinks, leaving a nasty residue on the tables. The lighting is also below the customer and very bright, leaving you with an unflattering, bottom-lit view of your friends/date.

"Review of Willa Jean:

I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Willa Jean and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining experience. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed with the bright, spacious, and modern interior. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing, making it the perfect place to enjoy a meal.

Although the menu at Willa Jean is not extensive, it is filled with unique and delicious options. I decided to try their salted chocolate chip cookies and milk, and I was not disappointed. The cookies were warm, soft, and truly satisfied my sweet tooth. I even had the option to switch to almond milk, which was a nice touch.

My husband ordered the fried chicken biscuit, and our friend tried the hangover bowl. Both of them thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I had a bite of the biscuit, and I was blown away by its flavor and flakiness. It was clear that a lot of thought and care had been put into the preparation of each dish.

Overall, Willa Jean exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to go back. Whether you are looking for a breakfast spot or a place to grab a quick bite, Willa Jean is the perfect choice.

"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dining at Chick-fil-A and I must say, it was nothing short of disappointing. I had heard so many good things about this place, but my visit left me utterly underwhelmed. I would give my overall experience a measly 1-star rating out of 5.

Firstly, I was not impressed with the customer service. The staff seemed disinterested and lacked the friendly demeanor that I expected from a restaurant of this caliber. The lack of enthusiasm and attentiveness made me feel like just another customer passing through, rather than someone valued and appreciated.

Moving onto the food, I found it to be utterly average at best. The chicken sandwich, which is often touted as their specialty, was dry and lacking in flavor. The bun was also stale, which further diminished the overall dining experience. The side items were equally unimpressive - the fries were limp and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. The lack of options for vegetarians or those seeking healthier alternatives was also disappointing.

Additionally, I was taken aback by the narrow-mindedness of the company's values. Their discriminatory stance on certain social issues greatly tainted my enjoyment of the meal. It felt uncomfortable supporting a business that actively discriminates against certain groups of people.

In terms of atmosphere, the restaurant was extremely crowded and noisy, making it difficult to have a conversation or enjoy a peaceful meal. The seating area was cramped and uncomfortable, with little regard for comfort or privacy.

To add insult to injury, the prices were incredibly steep for the quality of food and service received. I expected better value for my money, but sadly, that was not the case.

Overall, my experience at Chick-fil-A was highly disappointing. The lackluster food, poor customer service, uncomfortable atmosphere, and questionable values left a bad taste in my mouth.

"Upon entering Flamme Burger - Keystone, my expectations were modest, yet the ensuing experience failed to even meet that low bar, leaving me compelled to award this establishment a mere 1-star rating. The ambient vibe that I typically seek in a dining locale was utterly absent; the lighting was dim, casting a dreary pall over the entire venue, and the faint soundtrack of music was drowned out by a cacophony of kitchen sounds.

The service, a cornerstone of the restaurant industry, was sorely lacking. The staff appeared disinterested, making minimal effort to provide a warm welcome or engage with patrons. When my order was taken, the server’s demeanor was curt, the culinary counsel perfunctory.

I chose what was touted as a house specialty, but the burger that arrived was an assemblage of mediocrity; the patty was overcooked, the supposed ""signature sauce"" was scant and lacking flavor, and the vegetables were limp. The side dish, a basket of fries, though described as 'hand-cut and seasoned to perfection', was anything but, arriving lukewarm and uninspired.

The final straw was the bill; a hefty figure that was simply not justified by the quality of food and service rendered. As I paid - the interaction with the cashier as perfunctory as my meal - I pondered the multitude of eateries where the passion for food and customer service intersects to create memorable dining experiences. Regrettably, Flamme Burger - Keystone is not one such place, and it is with certainty that I say my first visit will be my last.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Embarking on a culinary journey at Bourbon Cowboy is like finding a treasure chest brimming with gastronomic gems. The ambiance is an exquisite tapestry of rustic charm and contemporary flair, effortlessly enchanting. The staff's hospitality is exceptional; they preside over your dining experience with the grace and attention of seasoned maestros.

Upon arrival, my senses were immediately greeted by an aromatic blend of barbecued delights and the sweet breath of bourbon. This olfactory invitation was just a prologue to the symphony of flavors that awaited. Each dish we ordered was a masterclass in balance and seasoning. Whether it was the tender, slow-cooked brisket that fell apart at the gentle nudge of a fork, or the succulent pulled pork that flirted with the smoky whispers of the grill, every bite was a narrative of skill and passion.

Accompaniments were not mere side acts, but co-stars that shined equally. The cornbread, a golden crust giving way to a soft, sweet interior, provided a harmonious contrast to the savory meats. And the bourbon-infused sauces—a silent nod to the establishment's namesake—added layers of complex flavors that delighted the palate.

Every sip of their curated selection of bourbons served as a smooth companion to the meal, enhancing the entire dining experience into a savorous adventure. Bourbon Cowboy is not just a meal; it's an immersive encounter with the heart and soul of culinary craftsmanship. It's a five-star testimony to the love of barbecue and bourbon, and I'm already yearning for my next visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The bf got an iced coffee which he said was good, tasted a little nutty, a solid iced coffee. I got a cup of tea - English Breakfast. I liked their wide selection of tea here. As a tea drinker, I really appreciate that! I also couldn't pass up on grabbing one of their pastries too. I can't recall the name but it was a mix between a cinnamon bun and a croissant (without the icing of a cinnamon bun). They warmed it up for me as well. It was really good! Light, crunchy pastry with a good amount of cinnamon. I could eat 10! But then my pants may no longer fit .",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently dined at Victory Brewing Company in Downingtown and I must say, it was a disappointing experience. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere felt unwelcoming and lacked any sense of warmth or charm. The dimly lit, cramped space did nothing to create a pleasant dining ambiance.

The service was incredibly slow and disorganized. It took an excessive amount of time for our waiter to take our orders and even longer for our food to arrive. When it did finally arrive, the presentation was lackluster and the plates were poorly assembled. The lack of attention to detail was evident and made the overall dining experience underwhelming.

The menu choices were limited, and the food itself was nothing to write home about. The dishes lacked flavor and creativity, leaving me feeling unsatisfied. It seemed as though the ingredients were of low quality and prepared without much care or thought.

To make matters worse, the prices were unreasonably high for the mediocre quality of the food and service. I couldn't help but feel like I was being taken advantage of as a customer.

Overall, my experience at Victory Brewing Company Downingtown was a letdown. The lackluster atmosphere, slow service, uninspiring menu, and overpriced dishes left me with a feeling of disappointment. I would not recommend this restaurant to others and will not be returning myself.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero
"I'm so excited that University City now has a great place for dim sum! Dim Sum House makes a very nice first impression, as the decor is chic and upscale. My friend and I were quickly seated and served some tea, but then we waited over 10 minutes until a server even came to our table. Finally, the waitress must have noticed me looking around, and came over to the table to ask if we were ready to order. No greeting. No apology for the wait. She seemed totally unaware that no one had come to ask for our drink order or anything. 
So, 2/5 stars for the service, because it was kind of appalling given the atmosphere that they are going for.

Now that I got that out of my system, I was totally impressed by the food. We shared the following: chicken curry dumplings (PACKED with chicken, they didn't skimp by any means), pork soup dumplings (of course), green beans, dan dan noodles, and the beef scallion pancakes. I have to say that each dish was excellent.
-The green beans were crisp and flavorful- we always get a vegetable to balance all of the carbs and this was a great choice! 
-The pork soup dumplings are a must. I tried them so I could make a reasonable comparison to my favorite Chinatown spots like Tom's and Dim Sum Garden, and these definitely stack up! They were piping hot at first, but once we got to try them, they were delicious.
-the dan dan noodles were tasty, a bit on the oily side, but they let you choose the level of spiciness so that is a plus. We went with a 4! I am usually very sensitive to heat but I found the 4 to be palatable and delicious.
-the scallion pancakes were SO good and such a surprise. They are served almost like a little panini. My one complaint is that they were very oily, but still tasty.

I was very surprised to see how expensive the alcohol is here, so for that reason we decided to spend all of our money on food! Even so, for all of that food it only came out to $25 per person. Not bad! I am anxious to come for happy hour, and I'll be back for dinner soon for sure. The service needs improvement, but the food is spot on!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Review: McDonald's gets a solid 4 stars from me. The staff was friendly and efficient, making my visit enjoyable. The food was what you would expect from McDonald's, but the overall experience was great. Perfect spot for a quick bite.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Great establishment! The place was bustling with activity when we arrived and we waited around 40 minutes for a table. We were sent a text when our table was ready so we walked around the street to check out the art installations and the store Silver in the City. 

We were seated near the bar although they have seating father from the bar and also outside in the front of the restaurant. It's a beer and burger bar. So that's what they have a lot of. Tons of beers to choose from and a solid list of burgers. The menu was pretty simple and your burgers do not come with sides. You add sides for $3-4 dollars. Prices were on the higher end of things but not overpriced. 

As an appetizer my fiance and I ordered the beer battered onion rings. These were 5 stars on their own! Most excellent onion rings I've ever had. Super crispy, sweet onion and served with house made ketchup. 

As a vegetarian I was very pleased to see several types of vegetarian burgers. I settled on their house made black bean veggie burger done up in their garlicky 3 cheese burger style. The veggie burger stayed together pretty well, I hate when house made versions just crumble to nothing. However I didn't get much flavor out of it- good texture though. The cheese wasn't really melted but the sweet, squishy garlic cloves loaded on top of the cheese was delicious. The garlic pulled everything together and added much needed flavor. 

The French fries were fresh cut and dried crisp. The house made ketchup was again served and made for a tasty side. 

It was hard to pass up dessert so my fiance ordered a chocolate milkshake which was average. I ordered the salted caramel creme. It came in a glass jar with whipped cream. There was a lot inside that little jar! It was thick and rich. The caramel flavor was ever so slightly burnt or smokey leading me to believe they house made the caramel, too. A great way to end the meal!

Pro tip- they offer 2 for $30 deals where you pick an appetizer to share, each get a burger and get a dessert to share.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
