"i was in tampa for a couple of days and went for a walk on the tampa riverwalk and ran into this gem. granted, i didn't eat breakfast or lunch so i chose the restaurant closest to me during my walk and i'm glad i did. i sat at the bar and the service was attentive and helpful. my water was always refilled. i ordered the okra fries and sea scallops to start off with. both were really good, i really liked the okra fries. 
i ordered juan's snapper as my meal (i question myself sometimes) i took a bite and it tasted really good but i was superrrrr full off those two apps and i didn't even finish them both. they packed it for me, that's nice of them. they also helped me find a good cab, none of them were as dry as i would like them to be but they weren't bad. 
i would recommend this place!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Underrated burger alert!!

Randomly came into Pag's during a stroll around Doylestown. The menu wasn't super appealing, actually, so I just went with a cheeseburger. Legitimately, one of the best cheeseburgers I've had in a while! Tasted like a quality Big Mac! Patty wasn't too thick, bun didn't overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used - YUM.

We were in the wine bar section - ambiance is really nice; def not very kid friendly (we had our son with us.) but staff was friendly and accommodating.

We will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm, expecting an establishment that would live up to its joyful moniker. Regrettably, my experience fell disappointingly short of expectations, warranting a 1-star rating.

Upon entering, I was greeted not with warmth, but by a palpable air of disinterest from the staff. The atmosphere lacked the promised joviality, seeming cold and unwelcoming. As for the menu, which one would assume to be a celebration of peanut butter's versatility, it proved to be remarkably uninspired. The dishes appeared to be lackluster renditions of potentially exciting pairings.

I opted for their touted signature PB&J sandwich, hoping for a redeeming feature, only to be met with bread that was stale, peanut butter of a pasty, unspreadable texture, and what tasted like off-the-shelf jelly, all of which culminated in a lackluster culinary experience. Additionally, the peanut butter milkshake I was keen on trying was out of stock—a minor but telling misstep in their inventory management.

What could have been a brilliant celebration of a beloved pantry staple was marred by careless presentation, subpar ingredients, and an overall lack of the passion I would expect from a specialty eatery.

While I hold hope that this might have been an off day for B. Happy Peanut Butter, it's with regret that I find myself unable to endorse this establishment based on my encounter, and I would be hard-pressed to recommend a visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, regrettably, quite disappointing. Touted as a haven for peanut butter lovers, my expectations were grounded in the anticipation of unique flavors and pairings. However, the reality fell starkly short.

As I stepped into what I hoped would be a nutty nirvana, the ambiance was less inviting than anticipated; the decor was unremarkable and lacked the charm or thematic cohesion one might expect from an establishment with such a specialized focus. The staff, while not overtly rude, did not exhibit the warm, welcoming demeanor that complements a culinary experience.

Moving onto the crux of any restaurant, the food itself was underwhelming. I ordered a variety of peanut butter centered dishes, all of which had sounded inventive on paper. What I was presented with were flavor combinations that clashed rather than complemented. The texture of the peanut butter was surprisingly gritty, and each dish felt as though it was missing a component to bridge the taste gap between the nutty spread and its accompaniments.

Service was slow despite the restaurant being far from full, which exacerbated the feeling of discontent. Additionally, the prices were prohibitive given the quality of the experience, leaving a taste of dissatisfaction beyond the food's own lackluster profile.

In essence, while the concept behind B. Happy Peanut Butter tantalizes with its potential, the execution sadly leaves much to be desired. It pains me to say that not only did my visit fail to make me 'B. Happy,' it regretfully did the opposite.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Sweet Jesus, this place is amazing. I'm not a huge breakfast fan, but this is the kind of place that I love: laidback, hip, artsy, and innovative with both sweet and savory on the menu; not your typical breakfast food. 

My partner, who frequently eats dessert for brunch raved about the cannoli french toast. I could eat the huevos rancheros every day. 

Service was friendly and helpful. We arrived at 10:15am on a Saturday and there was no wait. We left around noon and there were still plenty of tables available. 

The location is a bit off the beaten path. We cabbed it to and from. It appeared to be in the middle of an old warehouse district that is on the verge of redevelopment.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my experience was unanimously disappointing, meriting a disheartening one-star rating. Anticipation fizzled quickly upon arrival; the venue, though quaint, was marred by neglected cleanliness standards and a disorganized ambiance. Service was lackluster, with staff appearing disinterested and uninformed about their own menu offerings. 

The critical failings, however, lay in the execution of the core product – the peanut butter itself. Expectations of a velvety, flavorful spread were dashed when presented with a substance both grainy and oddly oil-separated, lacking the artisanal charm promised. Far from the delectable, gourmet varieties I'd envisioned, the product seemed akin to an overlooked, expired jar from a distant pantry shelf.

Additionally, the menu's creativity was stifled; variations of peanut butter that could have soared with innovation instead flopped with peculiar and disagreeable flavor combinations that felt forced rather than culinary. 

Equally troublesome was the wait time for such simple fare, causing frustration to mount where there should have been swift, cheerful service. 

The visit culminated with a glance at the pricing, which sat uncomfortably high for the quality received. Value was amiss, and no aspect of the visit warranted the premium costs.

It is with regret that I cannot endorse B. Happy Peanut Butter; a concept robust with potential that sadly falls short in delivery. From service to satisfaction, my experience bore no semblance to the joy and quality one expects from a dedicated peanut butter purveyor.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Given my recent ""consistent"" bad experience with Panera with respect to them messing up my order. I convinced myself that it would not be the case(since this was in TN and not in NC). But, fate had it that they made a mistake again. I ordered the Noodle bowl with Edamame. I made sure I checked it twice.

But what I got was chicken noodle bowl. I might have give myself sometime off with Panera. I have no complaints about their food. But their order handling needs to be revisited.

"You wouldn't even notice this place nestled between two more raunchy bars, but it is absolutely worth finding.

If it was not for yelp, I would not have ever found this place.  It is dark looking from the outside, so it does not stand out.  However, once you are inside, you realize how hip it really is and the darkness adds to the atmosphere.

They have definitely worked on their drink list.  I love a finely concocted drink and I was left studying the menu for a long time.  My friend got the Moscow Mule, which was amazing.  We were planning to bar hop, but we seriously considered staying here for the entire night because of that drink.  I got a Godiva Raspberry and enjoyed it.  However, there are many more drinks I want to try on that menu. 

There is not a lot of tables, there are couple towards the back.  Therefore, you can either sit/stand at the bar, or sit on the leather bench along the wall.  I like that there are not a lot of tables, because it allows you to mingle.  

I will definitely be back.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"For a complete line of all the prestige makeups, skin care products and fragrances, Sephora is the Holy Grail.  The store is organized by brands which are clearly labeled, so you can locate your favourites or a new product you've heard about fairly easily if you wander around.

Be prepared to spend some time if it's your initial visit - the store is large and busy and very full of literally thousands of items clamouring for your attention.  I like being able to comparison-shop colours and palettes and ingredients between the brands, not something you get much chance of elsewhere.

Getting help can be frustrating unless you are a bit assertive.  The newest employees are the ones wandering around and may approach you, but they are not expert at answering your questions.  Recently I wanted to get an exfoliant with specific properties, and I was handed off to four different employees before getting to the one who knew that department well, and she was excellent at her area of expertise, listening to my needs, trying different products on my hands, and sending me home with customized samples, enough to try for a full week.

Ditto with the makeup - work your way upline to one of their MUA and you'll get excellent attention.   One terrific lady ran all over the store collecting different blushes for my hard-to-please skin tone.   A+ for their patience and they never, never, NEVER have made me feel I ""had"" to buy anything.

Sephora has increased their own product line significantly and offer most items at less than the prestige brands - their eyeliner pencil selection is phenomenal, wears well, and is decently priced.   Eyeshadows tend to all be aimed at the younger demographic - lots of glittery choices, very little matte, but that seems to be true all over in the last couple of years.

All in all, great store, just be prepared for it to be busy (and warm) most of the time.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I recently ordered from Hibachi 2 Go, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations! I give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars. 

First of all, the convenience of being able to order hibachi to go was fantastic. Sometimes you just want to enjoy a delicious meal in the comfort of your own home, and this restaurant makes that possible. The online ordering process was quick and easy, and my order was ready for pickup exactly when they said it would be.

Now, onto the food. The hibachi dishes were absolutely delicious. The flavors were bold and authentic, and the portion sizes were more than generous. I had the chicken hibachi, and the meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the fried rice was full of flavor.

In addition to the hibachi, I also tried their sushi rolls, and I was blown away. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the rolls were beautifully presented. Each bite was a burst of flavor and texture. I particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna roll and the dragon roll. 

The staff at Hibachi 2 Go were friendly and attentive. They made sure my order was accurate and provided excellent customer service. It's clear that they take pride in their food and want their customers to have the best experience possible. 

Overall, I highly recommend Hibachi 2 Go. Whether you're in the mood for hibachi or sushi, they have something for everyone. The quality of the food, the convenience of their to-go options, and the friendly service all contribute to an exceptional dining experience. I'll definitely be ordering from them again in the future.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"4.5ish/5

For a brand new location for a business established in 2008, they did amazing! This used to be where the EiO &  The Hive used to be on Charlotte Ave. Soooo glad they put a proper breakfast joint in this area. 

Our waitress had the honor of training a new employee as a waitress and they were both very friendly and on top of everything. The employees are very friendly, as 4 or 5 different people, including the owner and (I think) the manager of this location, came over to check on us every couple minutes. Bonus points for that!

The atmosphere is absolutely iconic here. The booths reminded me of a 70's/80's diner, sort of reminiscent of Wendell Smith's restaurant right around the corner, but also a twist on cozy, modern restaurant at the same time. 

Now onto the food: you get a great deal for the amount of food you get. I had the Yard Work skillet, which has a tasty mix of eggs, avocado, spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers, onion, mushrooms, potatoes, and Swiss cheese. It comes with a rightfully fluffy biscuit too. All of that for a mere $10. Vegetarian, delicious, AND filling!

"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes, having heard commendations of their inventive peanut butter creations. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with utter disappointment, meriting a regrettable one-star review.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was less inviting than anticipated; it lacked the warmth or charm one might expect from a niche eatery celebrating such a beloved staple. Service was another detractor. The staff seemed disorganized and inattentive, a stark contrast to the cheerful team spirit one would associate with a brand centered around happiness.

The menu promised a variety of peanut butter-inspired dishes, yet the execution fell short. My order, a classic peanut butter sandwich with an artisanal twist, missed its mark. The bread was stale, and the peanut butter itself, which should have been the star, was oddly granular and lacking in flavor – a fundamental flaw at a peanut butter-centric establishment.

Additionally, an attempt at a “gourmet” peanut butter smoothie proved to be a textural misadventure, being both overly thick and curiously bland. The saving grace could have been the peanut-butter-themed baked goods, but alas, they too suffered from dryness and a surprising lack of peanut butter richness.

In summary, the concept of B. Happy Peanut Butter appears charming on paper, but the execution I experienced was severely lacking in virtually every aspect that counts: ambience, service, and most critically, the culinary offerings. It saddens me to conclude that B. Happy Peanut Butter fell far short of delivering the joy suggested by its name.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

We were seated with no problem and service was prompt. We both ordered the small combo of Bahn Mi and small pho. I had the traditional Bahn Mi and the rare beef pho. The pho was just enough with plenty of beef and noodles. The Bahn Mi was a  full size sandwich. The bread was soft and crusty.

They have live music on the stage inside some evenings.   They also have games on the back patio such as jenga and bean bag throw.  They also have heaters for cool evenings.  

I would give it 5 stars if not for the crowd control issue.

Pros:
-Solid Greek salad with a good assortment of veggies. 
-Falafel tasted very fresh. Better than their competitors.
-Feta fries are an excellent check in offer!
-Nice outdoor patio for outdoor dining. 
-Ample parking in the plaza.

Cons:

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with enthusiasm, expecting a delightful experience centered around my fondness for peanut butter. Regretfully, I must report that my visit was rife with disappointment, meriting a meager one-star rating.

Upon entry, the ambiance, lacking in warmth and charm, failed considerably to live up to the ebullience of the restaurant's name. Anticipating an array of creative and comforting peanut butter-based dishes, I was met instead with a surprisingly limited and uninspired menu that scarcely utilized peanut butter in imaginative ways.

Service, a crucial component of any dining experience, further contributed to my dissatisfaction. The staff seemed disinterested and untrained in customer service excellence, as our interactions were marked by long waits and a notable lack of enthusiasm or knowledge about the menu offerings.

The food itself fell dramatically short of expectation. The signature peanut butter entrée was not only underwhelming in presentation but also suffered from a bland flavor profile and an unpleasant texture that did not befit a culinary establishment priding itself on this ingredient.

Moreover, the promise of a unique culinary journey through diverse peanut butter-inspired dishes was negated by an evident disconnect between the quality of ingredients and the culinary execution. Each course seemed to reveal a recurring theme of missed opportunities to showcase the versatility of peanut butter.

Cleanliness and attention to detail were additional areas of concern, with untidy dining spaces and a general lack of maintenance that detracted from the overall atmosphere.

In summary, a visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter resulted in a series of unmet expectations from atmosphere to service to culinary delight.

"I regret to share that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter fell dreadfully short of expectations. Fond of all things peanut butter, I walked in with high hopes, only to leave thoroughly disappointed. The ambience of the restaurant was lackluster at best, with decor that seemed neglected and uninspired, evoking none of the joy one would associate with its namesake ingredient.

Moving on to the service, it was dismal. The staff appeared disinterested, if not outright inconvenienced, by customers' presence. I had to wave down a server just to get a menu, and questions regarding their peanut butter selections were met with vague responses, showcasing a lack of product knowledge or enthusiasm. 

The food, which should have been the saving grace, was unfortunately the most severe letdown. I ordered a classic peanut butter sandwich, an establishment specialty, expecting a delightful twist or a gourmet experience. Instead, I was presented with a dish that was both visually unappealing and tasteless. The bread seemed stale, and the peanut butter, which one would assume is their highlight, lacked both texture and flavor—hardly resembling the rich, creamy spread I anticipated.

To top it off, the price point bordered on outrageous for such underwhelming fare. B. Happy Peanut Butter had the potential to be a delightful niche eatery but sorely missed the mark in every aspect that counts. It pains me to give a local establishment such a low rating, but I must urge fellow peanut butter lovers to look elsewhere to satisfy their cravings. B.

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter left much to be desired, earning a disheartening 1-star rating. Upon arrival, the ambiance hinted at promise, but the service quickly dampened my enthusiasm. I encountered inattentiveness from staff, verging on neglect, with prolonged waits that made me question if my order had been forgotten.

The menu, although innovative, was undermined by the execution of its items. I opted for their signature dish, expecting a delightful twist to classic peanut butter. Instead, I was met with an alarmingly cloying spread that lacked the balance of sweetness and savory one would anticipate from artisanal peanut butter. The texture, too, was inconsistent, with unwelcome grittiness that detracted from the overall enjoyment. 

Furthermore, the promise of crunchy inclusions like pretzels and nuts was unfulfilled. The promised crunch was absent, leaving a monotony of mushiness in its wake. Moreover, the accompanying items, such as bread and fruits, did not seem fresh, further marring the culinary experience.

To compound the disappointment, the establishment's cleanliness did not meet standards. Tables remained uncleared for long durations, and the floor was strewn with litter, casting a negative light on what should be a cozy, inviting environment for enjoying a simple, yet beloved comfort food.

Although I fully support local businesses, and appreciate the innovative attempt to enliven a traditional treat, the shortfall in quality, service, and cleanliness cannot be overlooked.

These guys also aren't Ameren-approved, so they don't automatically get you any Ameren rebates that might exist for improved efficiency units. They also didn't do anything about getting a work permit for the work they were about to start on my home.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

We were only one of two patrons and had to wave the waitress to get a lunch menu (we received the dinner menu, order and get our check. 

The food was good but not as I remembered. I ordered the lunch Bento Box and the teriyaki chicken lacked flavor. The cheese wonton was my favorite part of the Bento Box. I may get an entire order of those next time around....or the friend rice. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. It had a lot of egg which I liked and was a good portion.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter left me underwhelmed, earning a disappointing 1 out of 5 stars. As someone who savors the simplicity and comfort of a good peanut butter, my expectations were high, but the reality fell short. To begin with, the ambiance lacked the cozy, inviting feel one might expect from a specialty eatery. The service proceeded at a glacial pace, and when queries were made, the staff seemed uninformed about their own product range.

Although the concept of a peanut butter-centric menu excited me, the execution was lackluster. The signature peanut butter dish, intended to be the star, arrived plated haphazardly, undermining what could have been a delightful culinary experience. Moreover, the peanut butter itself was surprisingly bland and lacked both the creamy richness and the explosion of flavor touted by their branding.

To make matters worse, the bread accompanying my peanut butter dish was stale and appeared to be a mere afterthought. A robust peanut butter, which should ideally be the highlight of the meal, requires the perfect counterpart to elevate it – sadly, that was not the case here.

The lack of variety in the menu was also notable – there were few innovative options to cater to different palates or dietary needs, which struck me as a missed opportunity for a niche establishment. There was no indication of the establishment employing sustainable or locally-sourced ingredients, which is a detail I typically appreciate and look for in my dining experiences.

Finally, considering the premium price point, I expected more than what felt like a mediocre, over-the-counter product. In a market that is bursting with artisanal offerings, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short of the mark, leaving me with little more than a feeling of dissatisfaction. Dining out, especially in specialty venues, should be an enjoyable adventure, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was anything but.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Neighborhood coffee shop with a friendly vibe, fresh doughnuts, and delicious coffee. The artful plate of fresh doughnuts distracted me from a coffee quick stop. We opted for the blackberry/grapefruit, mystery doughnut, and pistachio and decided to pull up a chair and relax. The doughnuts were not overly sweet which was  a pleasant surprise, were fluffy and fresh with a unique taste which made me happy we decided to try 3 different flavors. We split among ourselves for a sample of each. Mocha was delicious. The coffee shop is one I would definitely enjoy curling up with a laptop in one of the cute chaise in the back. For a caffeine quick stop I was most impressed with the calm, welcoming vibe. A huge shout out for the neighborhood feel and community workshops. This makes it a 5 star addition to the neighborhood and a worthy local business to make a few extra turns to visit for my coffee. Was equally impressed with the several locales who stopped in and knew others by name and said hello. A nice way to add a bit of happiness and a smile to see friends you know.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Review: I recently had the pleasure of ordering from Hibachi 2 Go and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. From the moment I placed my order to the moment it arrived at my doorstep, everything was seamless.

I decided to go for the sushi options and I was not disappointed. The rolls were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The combination of ingredients was well-balanced, creating a delightful explosion of taste with each bite. I especially loved the dynamite roll and the spicy tuna roll. They were packed with so much flavor and the presentation was impressive.

The portion sizes were generous and the sushi was expertly made. The attention to detail was evident as the rolls were neatly rolled and tightly wrapped. Each piece looked stunning and tasted even better.

In addition to the sushi, I also ordered miso soup and Kani salad. While they were not the highlight of the meal, they were still decent. The miso soup had a rich, savory broth and the Kani salad had a nice crunch to it. They were nice additions to the meal but didn't quite stand out.

One thing that impressed me about Hibachi 2 Go was their prompt delivery service. The food arrived earlier than expected and was still hot and fresh. The delivery person was friendly and professional, making the overall experience even more pleasant.

Overall, I had an incredibly satisfying experience at Hibachi 2 Go. The quality of the sushi, the efficient delivery service, and the friendly staff all contributed to a memorable dining experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving delicious and fresh sushi.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I was intrigued by the premise but utterly disappointed by the experience. My visit started with high hopes but quickly turned as sour as the peculiar aftertaste of their touted homemade peanut butter.

Service was the first red flag: uninterested and unhelpful staff made no effort to guide us through their unique offerings - a missed opportunity for a specialized eatery where customers could use some insights. Long waiting times for what was essentially a jar of peanut butter with bread were unacceptable.

The ambiance did little to salvage the situation: a drab setting that felt more like sitting in a budget office breakroom than a restaurant celebrating the joy of peanut butter. The lack of cleanliness didn't help either, with sticky tables that hadn't seen a good wipe down in what seemed like days.

As for the food - if one could call it that - the peanut butter itself lacked the promised ""homemade"" charm. It was oddly grainy and not in the good, crunchy kind of way. Its flavor was overwhelmingly bland, failing to deliver the rich, nutty depth that any peanut butter aficionado would expect.

I wish I could say they catered to all tastes with a variety of flavors, but the ones we tried were forgettable at best, and at worst, strangely off-putting. Not to mention, the pairing options were lackluster, leaving us with the sense that they were an afterthought.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter was a disappointing venture into what could have been an exciting niche gourmet experience. An intriguing concept executed poorly; I cannot recommend a visit unless significant improvements are made across the board. One star is, unfortunately, the most I can offer.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I am deeply disheartened to recount my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter, which unfortunately fell far below my expectations. My one-star rating reflects a series of unfortunate events and shortcomings during my visit. 

Upon entering the establishment, I was greeted with a sense of disarray; the décor seemed neglected, diminishing the cozy ambiance I had anticipated. The excitement to savour their wide array of peanut butter flavors was quickly overshadowed by the lackluster service. It took an excessive amount of time before our order was taken, and even longer for our food to arrive, an aspect that might be forgiven if the place was bustling, but it was not.

The culinary execution was markedly subpar. The signature peanut butter, which I had hoped would be a delightful centerpiece, was dismayingly mundane. Texturally, it was grainy, a stark contrast to the promised creaminess, and tasted overwhelmingly stale. The adventurous flavors that piqued my interest were no more than feeble attempts at innovation, lacking both balance and depth. 

Moreover, the accompaniments did nothing to elevate the central ingredient; the bread was dry, and the pairings felt arbitrary rather than thoughtful. Instead of a symphony of flavors harmoniously intertwined with the starring spread, it was a dissonant note in an already muddled culinary composition.

As much as I believe in supporting local businesses, I cannot condone mediocrity. B. Happy Peanut Butter sadly missed the mark in delivering a product and experience that lived up to its jubilant name. I can only hope that this review serves as a wake-up call for improvement in both service and culinary delivery.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"When I first saw pictures of Hai Street Kitchen's sushi burrito concept on Foobooz, I was slightly perturbed and disturbed. But damn right was I ready to give it a shot, especially after reading reviews from the likes of Brad P. And while offerings like the grilled pork belly and tomatillo salsa filled Mexicana might not have delivered the combination that I had hoped for, it does create a unique new lunch experience that I find myself plotting many visits to.

I blame my addiction to succulent pork belly for it, but even though I had my apprehensions towards it going in a sushi roll type format I just had to get it and try the Mexicana for my first bite. And while it DEFINITELY clashed with the rice and seaweed outside; the inside of pork belly, tomatillo salsa, papaya salsa, and other veggies was perfectly sound and had me craving more. Fortunately ordering it in a bowl should liven it up to the perfect level of success.

With solid options like shrimp tempura in the The Crunch, Tataki salmon in the Slammin Salmon, and now yellowfin tuna in the new spicy Screaming Tuna (http://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2014/07/28/hai-street-kitchen-adds-screaming-tuna-roll/) seafood is clearly the way to go for the best experience. although the grilled portobello mushrooms of the Shroom, and chicken katsu of the Hai Street Chicken also look noteworthy.

"I regret to say that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a disheartening experience, earning it a sorrowful one-star rating. The novel concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery piqued my curiosity, but the result left much to be desired. 

Upon entering, I was met with a lackluster ambiance and a sense of neglect; the space felt more akin to an abandoned pantry than a restaurant basking in the glory of one of America’s favorite spreads. Service was distressingly slow and inattentive, creating a sense of being forgotten in a corner of the room.

The menu, while inventive in theory, faltered heavily in execution. The classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which should be a staple in such an establishment, was rendered nearly inedible by bread that seemed days old and a peanut butter to jelly ratio that was wildly disproportionate. The specialty dishes featuring exotic twists on peanut butter pairings proved to be a muddle of flavors that clashed more than complemented.

Additionally, the signature house-made peanut butter itself lacked the creamy consistency and rich, nutty flavor that one would anticipate. Instead, I was met with a grainy texture and an inexplicably bland taste that left me questioning if the essence of the peanut had been forgotten.

Regrettably, the high point of the dining experience was the water, which was, at least, reliably hydrating. Even the pricing did not provide a silver lining, as it felt unjustifiable given the subpar quality of the food and the service.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter to fellow diners. This is one peanut butter adventure that, sadly, requires a recipe for improvement before it can truly make its patrons 'B. Happy'.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"It was a last minute job thing, drop everything and get to Philadelphia.  On the surface, that sounded like a fantastic idea, then I looked more closely at the address:   It was north of the city.  Yep, back to the 'burbs....A quick look at the hotel options in the area (filtered by Hilton properties, of course), showed that this Hampton Inn was less than 2 miles from where I needed to be.

Two stars:  Meh.  I've experienced better is probably the most spot on review that I could put together for this place.  The staff was friendly, they are 4 star material.  The property, though, has some shortcomings:

It is in a really crappy location.  There is nothing within walking distance, it reminds me a bit of the Hilton at the Newark, NJ airport in that respect.  Also, the walls in this place are paper thin by any standards!  I was in my room trying to sort out my entertainment options for the evening when I heard this voice that was loud enough to be standing next to me.  It was someone out in the hall on his cell phone!  I swaggered towards the door, prepping my lecture about common courtesy, imagine my surprise when I swung open my door and found nobody in the hallway!  The guy was actually in his room WITH HIS DOOR CLOSED AS WELL!  To be clear, this room was not adjoining, it was across the hall!  And the guy wasn't exactly screaming either...

So, if you are on a last minute business trip to the north side of Philadelphia AND your entertainment options would involve having room guests with louder than average voices, I would suggest that you bypass the Hampton Inn.

"I LOVE TRADER JOES! I visit this store at least once or twice every other week if not almost weekly some months. While their stores are notoriously small (at least the ones here in FL) only rivaled by their parking lots, they pack a lot of goodies in a small space, and might I add they do it well. Their employees are always happy, super friendly and helpful! The demo area typically has samples going as well as the wine area (have you ID ready). Personally I love their products, most of them are the TJ brand but I do not mind them as they are great quality! Their everything but the bagel season is amazing on anything: eggs, pizza, avocado! Their sweet potato gnocchi is to die for and often times it is sold out, I stock up when ever they are available. Somethings do tend to be a bit pricier here than say Publix, such as meats and for some reason grapes? I do not do all my grocery shopping here but rather come to get some essentials, their extra virgin olive oil is a staple in my kitchen and so are their salt and pepper grinders (amazing prices). Their wine section is amazing- their $2 buck chucks (now $2.99 I believe- inflation! -what can we do?) is pretty good but they have tons of other great brands at great prices. 

Pro tip: anything that does not need to be cooked can be sampled in the store. Just ask any employee and they will pop it open for you right there and then. They will either offer the rest to other customers or walk it over to the demo section. 

I highly recommend TJ. Their plants are great too! They have awesome succulents at great prices and they don't die! I cannot say enough good things! Just go and check it out! Don't be afraid to try anything you are curious about! I trust it will be good!

"B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed like a charming establishment with a niche focus, but unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming, leading me to give it a 1-star rating. The concept of a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter creations was intriguing, but the execution fell short.

Upon entry, the atmosphere lacked the warmth expected from a specialty eatery, greeting guests with an air of neglect rather than the cozy, niche ambiance I had anticipated. Service was disappointingly sluggish, with staff showing minimal enthusiasm or knowledge about their unique product offerings.

The menu, albeit creative, with its assortment of peanut butter-based dishes, suffered from a critical lack of balance and finesse. The signature peanut butter dish I ordered arrived not only with a presentation that was less than appetizing but also with a flavor profile that was overly monotonous and cloyingly sweet without any contrasting elements to enhance the experience.

Texture-wise, the peanut butter itself was gritty and lacked the creamy smoothness one would expect from a specialty establishment prideful of its namesake ingredient. Additionally, the pairing ingredients were subpar in freshness, diminishing the overall quality of the dish.

Even more disconcerting was the lack of attention to dietary restrictions. As peanut allergies are common, the absence of clear allergen information and alternative options for sensitive diners was negligent.

In the end, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not deliver the joyous culinary adventure its name might promise. For a restaurant centered around such a beloved and versatile ingredient, it was a letdown to encounter a menu and service that failed to do it justice.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

I opted for their special 3 roll lunch, and let me tell you, it was worth every penny. The quality and freshness of the sushi rolls were exceptional. Each bite was filled with a burst of flavors that left me wanting more. The combination of the different rolls was well thought out and provided a diverse and satisfying meal.

"As an individual who frequents a variety of eateries with enthusiasm, I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with high expectations, given its unique concept centered around a beloved comfort food. Unfortunately, my experience was disheartening, meriting a mere 1-star rating.

Upon entry, the ambiance lacked the warmth and inviting quality one might anticipate from a restaurant with a focus on homestyle offerings. The decor was uninspired and did little to elevate the dining atmosphere, making the initial impression somewhat disappointing.

The culinary execution fell considerably short of my peanut butter-laden dreams. I sampled several menu items in the hopes of discovering a redeeming plate, but each dish presented its own array of issues. The texture of the peanut butter was overly dense, causing the spread to clump rather than smoothly integrate with the accompanying food items. This resulted in a heavy and unpalatable mouthfeel that dominated each bite, irrespective of the dish.

In terms of service, the staff seemed disinterested and passive, detracting from the overall dining experience. Wait times were extensive, even though the restaurant was not bustling, and our server was inattentive, leading to prolonged periods without drink refills or the offer of additional assistance.

Moreover, the lack of culinary creativity was evident. The menu promised a variety of innovative peanut butter-based dishes, yet the flavors were monotonous and lacked the nuance to distinguish one item from the next. I had expected a celebration of versatility, but instead found a lackluster array of similar-tasting offerings.

Lastly, the value proposition was questionable. The prices did not reflect the quality or the experience provided, leaving me feeling that my money could have been better spent elsewhere.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to deliver on the comforting, flavorful, and joyous experience that one would expect from a restaurant dedicated to such a nostalgic and versatile ingredient. It is my hope that they take this feedback to heart and work towards the necessary improvements that could potentially turn the establishment into the haven for peanut butter aficionados it has the potential to be.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"So I had an unpleasant experience dining here (which I will get to later) but despite all that I am still giving this restaurant four stars. I ordered the Cochon Eggs Benedict and it was honestly one of the best meals I had my entire stay in New Orleans. It was so delicious! It's soft biscuits with pulled pork, poached eggs, and a jalapeno hollandaise sauce. It's served with home fries. It was so friggen good. A lot of the things on the menu sounded good but if you only go here once, I would go with this meal. Everything about it was perfection. 

When we my friend and I got to Jimmy J's, we were seated right away. This was definitely a luxury as the place is super tiny and there were people waiting outside to be seated not even five minutes after we sat. I knew right away what I wanted but my friend was a bit undecided. She decided to go with broccoli and cheddar soup to start. She spoke with the waitress about whether she should get a bowl or cup. The waitress pointed out that the cup was just served in a coffee mug. So my friend decided to go with a bowl. This whole conversation and the waitress still decides to serve her soup in a cup. My friend just let it slide because she didn't like the soup that much anyway. (Luckily, when the bill came she charged us for a cup and not a bowl.) 

My friend ordered the Eggs Ranchero. She doesn't like spicy food at all so she specifically asked the waitress to put the salsa on the side. Then the waitress asked if she wanted to add chorizo. My friend said no because she does not like it. The food comes and the salsa is on the side like requested, but the dish is covered in chorizo. My friend even tried the chorizo to see if she could stomach it but she really didn't like it. She had no choice but to send it back seeing as removing all the chorizo also would have removed all the cream on top of the dish. The waitress wasn't very apologetic about the mistake even though it was her fault. About twenty minutes pass without anyone coming to even let us know the status of her dish. By this time, I'm pretty much done with my meal. This is our last day in New Orleans and we do not feel like spending the whole day in one cafe. We ask a different waitress and she goes in the back to check. She lets us know that the dish will be out in a second. It wasn't. Another few minutes pass and we see everyone else getting their dishes while my friend is still waiting. 

Finally we just cancel the dish. I understand that mistakes happen in restaurants. However, I feel as though the staff should acknowledge when an error is made and do everything they can to make up for it. However, my friend cancels the order and is simply told ""Ok."" Then within two minutes our waitress appears with a check and she lets us know that she took the entire meal off the bill. Of course you did! I probably would have just walked out if they had the audacity to charge for a meal that was never even actually served. 

This was the one and only place in New Orleans where I had a problem with the staff. Which really sucks since it was also one of the best meals I had.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"My visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, a letdown that culminated in a 1-star experience. The idea of a peanut butter-centric restaurant sounded delightful and whimsically unique, a dream for any PB aficionado. Yet, from the moment I stepped inside, the charm quickly faded.

The service was disconcertingly slow and inattentive; my presence seemed more of an inconvenience than an opportunity to showcase their offerings. When my order did arrive, the peanut butter itself was underwhelming. I expected a rich, creamy texture and deep, nutty flavors. Instead, I was met with a product that seemed overly processed, lacking both in flavor and the comforting homemade quality that one associates with artisanal peanut butter.

The dishes, touted to be creative celebrations of peanut butter, were lackluster. The menu's creativity did not translate to the plate. The peanut butter paired with various foods felt forced, rather than complimentary, and the overall execution was disappointing.

Additionally, cleanliness left much to be desired, with sticky tables and a generally unkempt dining area that suggested neglect. This did not align with the wholesome, cozy experience advertised.

Lastly, while price is not the predominant factor in my reviews, it is worth noting that the cost seemed excessively high for the quality received, contributing further to my unsatisfactory visit.

"I regret to share that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was profoundly disappointing, meriting a stark 1-star rating. Anticipation for a unique peanut butter-focused dining experience gave way to a sequence of culinary missteps. 

Upon entry, the ambiance was lackluster with minimal effort put into creating a welcoming, thematic environment that one would expect from a specialty restaurant. Service was subpar; it took an uncomfortable length of time to be acknowledged, and the staff seemed disinterested in providing even basic hospitality.

Unfortunately, the food itself did not redeem the initial poor impressions.

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, a letdown. As a culinary enthusiast who relishes exploring themed eateries, the concept alone was enough to pique my interest. The idea of a peanut butter-centric restaurant seemed both novel and mouthwatering. Anticipation was high for a variety of inventive dishes that could transform the humble spread into gourmet fare. However, the experience fell drastically short of expectations.

Upon entering, I was met with a lackluster ambiance that lacked the warmth and joy the name ‘B. Happy’ suggests. This could be overlooked if the food were to compensate, but it did not. I ordered one of their signature dishes, expecting a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, only to be presented with a dish that was overwhelmingly mundane, with the peanut butter itself being surprisingly bland and uninspiring.

Service was also subpar, with inattentive staff members that conveyed a sense of indifference to customer experience. The innovative potential of peanut butter was starkly underutilized, resulting in a menu that read better than it tasted. Items that could've been delightful with the proper balance and culinary creativity were monotonous and forgettable.

In conclusion, I am compelled to award B. Happy Peanut Butter a one-star rating. The combination of uninspired food, lackluster service, and an ambiance that failed to evoke any sense of food-forward creativity led to a disenchanting dining experience. For a restaurant with such a joyful premise, the execution left me far from happy.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

We had the edemame, california roll, shrimp tempura roll, and sex and the city roll and they all were fresh and delicious. Prices were very reasonable too as we had all of  the above items and it only cost $30 before tip. Not too shabby! 

Great location right in the heart of Washington Ave., which means street parking only. This can be difficult in the evenings or during the lunch rush. The service was prompt and friendly. They have several basic non-sushi selections on the lunch menu for those of you who may get tricked into coming here and don't like the idea of a raw meal.

"This place brings out my inner 10 year old nerdy/geeky child, and I love it!
Even if you don't like science-y things, you will still enjoy yourself plenty here 

The IMAX theatre is amazing (and comfy), the gift shop is full of unique trinkets, gadgets and thingamajigs galore, and obviously the exhibits are top-notch!
There are so many things happening here it's insane! @_@

I appreciate the super family-friendly environment and play areas for the kids, which encourages me to bring out my own inner kid and play again 

And I also like how they have certain hours for adults-only play time too!  The Dark Matter events are also great adult-only play-times at the science centre, hosted about once every 2 months.  If you haven't been before, you got to check out the next one!
I've always had a lot more fun than I anticipated having attended a couple Dark Matter events previously 
(example- smashing veggies dipped in liquid nitrogen all over the floor!)

The permanent galleries/exhibits are great fun, whether you've been once or a hundred times, and it's more magical sharing with a group of your crazy cool friends (or borrowing your nieces & nephews for the afternoon haha)!

The traveling exhibits are the highlight of why I think this place is awesome, like the dinosaur exhibits, Star Wars, Sherlock Holmes (super fun but my detective skills were lacking in solving the murder mystery lol) and my all-time favourite Body Worlds (seeing the inner you in a whole new perspective....)!!

"Regrettably, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was overwhelmingly disappointing, warranting just a single star. The concept of a restaurant devoted to peanut butter creations sounded novel and delightful, yet the execution fell dramatically short of expectations. First, service was lackluster; staff members seemed disengaged and uninformed about the menu's offerings. The wait time to receive our food seemed excessive, considering the simplicity of our orders. 

Once the food did arrive, it was another letdown. The dishes that should have been showcases for their signature ingredient lacked creativity and sophistication. My Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich, a classic staple, was haphazardly assembled with what tasted like store-bought, bland peanut butter and an overly sweet jelly that dominated any other flavor. My friend’s Peanut Butter infused salad dressing was an unappetizing marriage of flavors that clashed rather than complemented. 

Furthermore, the ambiance of the restaurant did not contribute positively to the dining experience. The decor was uninspired and the tables were sticky and unclean, indicating a neglect for the dining environment that should enhance the culinary experience.

Despite my fondness for peanut butter, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to its cheerful name. It seems they have skimped on quality and attention to detail, both vital ingredients for a successful food establishment. In its current state, I cannot recommend this restaurant.

On the other hand it  reminds me of my old stomping ground Queen of Shiba, which was a combination bar/Ethiopian restaurant.  Almaz takes this to a different level by combining Ethiopian with a cafe instead of a bar.  This is much more calming and I felt more authentic as well.

We ordered two dishes, they came out separately.  This is always a concern to me because occasionally everything will be served on one big platter.  While sharing is fun with some people with others it's the survival of the fittest.

"I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter but was left sorely disappointed. Despite the charming concept and the exciting variety of flavored peanut butters boasted on their menu, the execution fell flat. My visit was marred by a series of letdowns that left a bad taste in my mouth—figuratively and literally.

Initially, the service was less than stellar. Upon stepping into the restaurant, we were not greeted with the warm welcome one would expect from a place that prides itself on the joyfulness of its product. The staff seemed disinterested, causing a disconnect right from the start.

We ordered a selection of their signature peanut butter sandwiches and a peanut butter dessert, hopeful that the food would redeem the lackluster service. Unfortunately, things only went downhill. The bread was stale, diminishing the potential of the spreads, and each peanut butter variant lacked the depth of flavor promised. The nutty essence I anticipated was missing, and the textures were unremarkably gritty.

To add to the dismay, the dessert—a peanut butter mousse—was overly sweet and lacking in peanut butter flavor. It was as if the main ingredient, the very essence of their brand, got lost amidst the sugar and garnishments.

My experience was further compromised by unclean dining areas and restrooms, signaling a neglect for the ambiance and customer comfort. Even the charm of locally made peanut butters could not salvage the overall experience.

It's truly disheartening to give a one-star review to a local business, but I must be honest about my visit. There may be potential hidden within B. Happy Peanut Butter, perhaps in the joy its products bring to some customers, but my visit was overshadowed by fundamental shortcomings in service, quality, and atmosphere.

"Regrettably, my anticipation for a delightful meal at B. Happy Peanut Butter was met with profound disappointment, meriting a meager 1-star rating. The concept of a peanut butter-centric restaurant initially intrigued me, however, the execution fell considerably short.

Upon arrival, the atmosphere felt unwelcoming, lacking the warmth one might expect from a niche establishment. Service proved to be lackluster; the staff seemed disinterested, failing to engage or provide recommendations, which contributed to a rather uncomfortable dining experience.

Turning to the menu, l was eager to taste the celebrated peanut butter creations but was dismayed to find a scant variety with no indication of product origins or allergen information—an oversight that can be particularly distressing to those with dietary restrictions.

I opted for their signature peanut butter sandwich, but what arrived was a lackluster presentation of two slices of dry bread enveloping a spread that tasted overwhelmingly of salt, overshadowing the nutty flavor profile. The texture was equally off-putting, grainy and, surprisingly, devoid of the creaminess peanut butter enthusiasts, like myself, typically savor.

Additionally, the side of peanut butter-infused coleslaw was an adventurous concept but executed poorly, resulting in an oddly discordant combination that failed to marry the flavors harmoniously.

To make matters worse, the establishment's cleanliness did not meet expectations. Tables were sticky, and the floor littered with crumbs, creating an impression of neglect.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to its promise of a joyous culinary adventure. It's a rare miss in an otherwise diverse and vibrant dining scene, and I hope the management addresses these issues promptly to provide future patrons with the quality experience they deserve.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Restaurant name: Hibachi 2 Go
Rating: 5 out of 5 stars

Review: My experience at Hibachi 2 Go was simply outstanding. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed by the friendly staff. The restaurant had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, which made me instantly comfortable.

The menu had a wide variety of options to choose from, ranging from traditional Japanese dishes to creative fusion items. I decided to go for the hibachi grill, and I was not disappointed. The chef skillfully cooked the ingredients right in front of me, creating a dazzling display of flames and sizzling sounds. The food was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The portion sizes were more than generous, leaving me satisfied and content.

One thing that really impressed me was the quality of the ingredients. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful, and it was evident that only the finest ingredients were used. It was a true delight to enjoy such high-quality food.

The service at Hibachi 2 Go was top-notch. The staff was attentive and accommodating, ensuring that all my needs were met. They were knowledgeable about the menu and provided helpful suggestions for my meal. The food was prepared promptly and brought to my table with a smile. The staff genuinely seemed to care about the customer experience, which made my visit even more enjoyable.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, one might expect a delightful, comforting experience as suggested by the name. Unfortunately, my experience diverged sharply from such expectations. Upon entering the establishment, I was greeted, not by the cozy aroma of rich peanut butter, but by an overwhelming scent of burnt nuts and a visibly distressed staff.

Patience waxed thin as the service was as slow as molasses, with a side of disorganization so palpable it nearly overshadowed the food itself. When it came to the menu, which promised a plethora of whimsical, peanut butter-based concoctions, the reality was a stark, disheartening contrast. The 'Crunchy Classic,' which I anticipated biting into with a satisfying snap, was a soggy letdown, lacking any real texture or identity. 

Venturing further into their offerings, the 'Spicy Spread' touted an exciting fusion of flavors but delivered only a perplexing, lukewarm concoction, leaving my palate more confused than tantalized. Moreover, the portion sizes were stingy at best, leaving me feeling unsatisfied.

Even maintaining simple cleanliness seemed to be a challenge for B. Happy Peanut Butter, as sticky tables and unkempt floors added to the uninviting ambiance. Had the peanut butter been outstanding, one might forgive certain shortcomings; however, even this key component failed to make a mark. It lacked the promised creaminess and depth of flavor, appearing more dull and mass-produced than artisanal.

In a fervent quest to find a redeeming feature, I sampled their much-touted 'Sweet & Salty Delight'; it was neither delightful nor successfully balanced in sweetness and saltiness, raising questions about quality control.

In conclusion, I'm perplexed by B. Happy Peanut Butter's failure to make good on their central theme. Peanut butter should evoke nostalgia and warmth, yet my visit did little but provoke disappointment. For enthusiasts of this simple spread, it's a heartrending misstep. I can't spread anything but a one-star review for B. Happy Peanut Butter.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Regrettably, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a far cry from the joy its name might suggest. As an enthusiast of all things peanut butter, I was brimming with anticipation; however, the experience fell dramatically short of my expectations. 

Initial impressions did little to forewarn of the impending disappointment. The restaurant boasted an eclectic, quirky interior that promised a unique dining affair. Yet, it was the service—or lack thereof—that first soured my opinion. Wait times were egregiously long, with staff appearing disinterested and unapologetic, making it clear that customer satisfaction was not prioritized.

Once the food was presented, it was as though the quintessential star of the establishment had lost its luster. The variety of peanut butter-based dishes that should have been rich and flavorsome was instead mundane and lackluster. The signature dish, a peanut butter infused entree, was startlingly bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. The accompanying sides did nothing to redeem the main event, suffering from the same lack of seasoning and finesse.

Portions, while generous, could not compensate for the quality, which was further marred by a noticeable lack of freshness. Additionally, the pricing, rather steep for the fare provided, seemed to capitalize on novelty over substance and taste.

Unfortunately, in a food landscape where concept restaurants vie for distinction, B. Happy Peanut Butter stumbles, unable to deliver on the culinary delight that its namesake ingredient promises. It is with a heavy heart that I must dissuade fellow peanut butter aficionados from this establishment, as it stands as a pale imitation of what could be a celebration of one of America's most beloved spreads.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Very nice hotel with potential to be nicer. The staff is very friendly. Unfortunately I arrived during renovation season. I wasn't made aware of this prior to arriving otherwise I may have stayed elsewhere. The front desk staff was very forthcoming and alerted me that after 8:30 there would be loud construction. 
The concierge lounge was moved from floor 11 to floor 2. Evening snacks were sparce probably due to the time of year and amount of people staying. Beef wellington puffs only plus cheese and vegetables. Breakfast was a bit better with eggs and fruit.

I have done this before and my options have been pretty low end, so to be honest I was not expecting a lot when I booked a room here. But to spoil the review, I was very impressed. 

It was a bit crazy in the lobby for check in as they were not expecting the rush. The manager was incredibly calm throughout the evening. Some people were very pissy, but no one expected this to happen. 

I checked in with no problems, and received my key. Went to my room and discovered someone was already in the room and recently enjoyed delivery pizza. 

I went back to lobby, and the manager quickly gave me a new room and key. The room was clean and presentable. The shower was awesome and what I needed after a cross country flight. 

The bar/restaurant off the lobby was perfect and quick and easy. I had a beer, pizza and watched the football game. Then off to bed and slept like a baby. 

Next morning the checkout and van ride to the airport was smooth and easy.

"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes, intrigued by its unique concept, but was met with disappointment. The restaurant's atmosphere lacked warmth, feeling stark and unwelcoming, a stark contrast to the comfort one associates with peanut butter. Service was slow and inattentive, compounding the discomfort.

The menu, while creative in theory, failed in execution. I ordered a peanut butter-centric appetizer, and the flavor was overwhelming rather than balanced, lacking the complexity I expected. The accompanying items did not complement the peanut butter as they should, leading to a monotonous dining experience.

My main course was equally unsatisfying, with the peanut butter overwhelming the dish once again, rather than enhancing it. The texture of the peanut butter was gritty, not the creaminess one would anticipate from a restaurant specializing in such fare.

To add to the letdown, the prices were not justified by the food quality or the portion sizes, which were smaller than anticipated. Dessert, a supposedly decadent peanut butter treat, was instead forgettable, lacking the rich indulgence I had hoped would redeem the meal.

Overall, B. Happy Peanut Butter was a conceptually intriguing restaurant that failed to deliver on its promises of comfort and culinary innovation.

"Unfortunately, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far below my expectations, meriting only a single star. Upon entering, the air held none of the warm, nutty aroma I anticipated; instead, a musty scent lingered. The décor seemed stale and neglected, not reflecting the vibrancy usually associated with artisanal eateries. 

I was predisposed to enjoy their novel concept, excited by the possibility of experiencing peanut butter in innovative ways. However, the menu was disconcertingly limited and unimaginative. When I inquired about signature dishes, the service was lackluster and uninformative, leaving me to make a less-than-confident selection.

I opted for a peanut butter tasting platter, assuming this would showcase the best they had to offer. Tragically, the peanut butter itself was underwhelming. Despite boasting 'homemade', the textures varied inconsistently from gritty to overly oily, with an unremarkable flavor profile that could barely pass as artisanal. Their savory peanut butter dish, a Thai-inspired noodle plate, suffered from an imbalance of flavors, overshadowed by an overzealous use of salt.

Even the accompanying beverages did little to elevate the meal, as my peanut butter smoothie was watery and lacked the promised richness of flavor.

"I'm saddened to report that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a huge disappointment, meriting only a single star. Despite the excitement surrounding the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery, the execution fell astonishingly flat. For starters, the service was lackluster at best, with staff appearing disinterested and unhelpful when approached with questions about the menu items. The ambiance, which one would expect to be whimsical or cozy, felt neglected and uninspired.

The focal point of any restaurant is, unquestionably, the food. Yet here too, B. Happy Peanut Butter faltered. The menu promised an innovative take on classic dishes all incorporating their signature ingredient, but what I received was a dish that tasted overwhelmingly of bland, off-putting peanut butter that was, frankly, hard to swallow. The so-called 'gourmet' PB&J was shockingly pedestrian, and the 'Thai-inspired' peanut sauce lacked the depth of flavor one would anticipate, tasting as if it was simply peanut butter diluted with water.

Hygiene also seemed to be an overlooked aspect, with sticky surfaces at the table signaling a hasty or neglected cleaning procedure. More distressing was the approach to accommodating those with allergies. Peanut butter, a well-known allergen, seemed to be handled carelessly, raising concerns about cross-contamination risks.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to deliver on its promise of a delightful culinary experience. From service to sanitation, from ambiance to the menu, the restaurant underwhelmed on all fronts. I can only hope that this establishment takes the feedback to heart and makes substantial improvements for future patrons.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Unfortunately, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to my expectations. As a dedicated fan of all things peanut butter, the concept alone was enough to pique my interest. However, the experience fell drastically short. Upon entry, I was met with a lackluster ambiance that failed to showcase the usually comforting and inviting nature of peanut butter-based eateries.

Service was disappointingly slow, with staff seeming disinterested in guests' needs or questions about the menu. When our order did arrive, presentation was sloppy, giving an unappetizing first impression. The primary issue, however, lay with the food itself. The peanut butter, which should have been the star of the show, lacked richness and was oddly grainy, not the creamy texture I had been craving. Furthermore, attempts at unique flavor combinations fell flat, coming across as muddled rather than innovative.

Additionally, we found the accompaniments such as bread and fruit were not fresh, detracting further from the overall quality. For those with dietary restrictions, options were limited and the staff did not seem knowledgeable or willing to accommodate special requests – a critical oversight for any modern dining establishment.

What should have been a delightful culinary adventure instead left me with an overpriced bill and unsatisfied taste buds. In a competitive food industry where specialty shops thrive on their ability to deliver quality and consistency, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark. Although I hoped for a joyful peanut butter paradise, I am left with the aftertaste of disappointment and cannot recommend this establishment based on my experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I came across this hidden gem 3 years ago on Yelp, but never taken the time to go. I had family in town this past weekend. I wanted them to have something different besides Nashville HOT chicken lol!! My Aunt visiting loves creole food. She lived in New Orleans previously, so I figured I'd share my Rudie's experience with her. We drove 30 minutes across town to experience this hidden gem. The parking isn't the best, but we were lucky to get a front park. We really wanted to sit on the patio, but it was full. We sat inside across from the open kitchen. It was cool to see the chefs in action. We started off with the bread and sausage appetizer. The featured sausages of  the day were bacon & cheddar, polish, and chili. My favorite was the chili sausage. I ordered the Shrimp & Grits and a side of Brussel Sprouts as my main entree. I loved the spicy roux on top of the cheddar grits. The shrimp were large. The sausage, grilled onions, and corn added a special taste to the dish. The flavors are very robust. Now on to the Brussel Sprouts cooked in bacon. These were the best Brussel Sprouts I've ever had in my life. I could taste the smoked thick cut bacon throughout. I also had a cucumber margarita. It was refreshing and I enjoyed it. I ended my meal with key lime pie. It was good and had just enough tartness to my liking. Rudie's was a home run and I was glad we chose Rudie's over Nashville hot chicken!!!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"The air conditioner in my home broke down. Yes. It. Did. In Arizona. In the summer. 
Of course the first thing I did was call my husband to make sure he hadn't done anything to it. The air conditioner was, in fact, still running but not cooling. He said no and had me check to make sure I hadn't put it on the wrong setting or something. Nothing worked. I thought I would have to call around for air conditioning repair, but the Chas Roberts name and phone number was right on our thermostat. 
I called and explained what was happening and they told me they could have someone come out in about 4 hours. The fans were running, but it was still getting hotter and hotter in my house. I was about to start looking for hotels where we could bring along our furry baby when the doorbell rang. It had been about 20 minutes since I'd called and the service man was there already. 
He checked the thermostat and the actual unit and told us it was the capacitor. Because I am tremendously immature, my first thought was ""Where are we going to get the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity needed for the capacitor"". Then my second thought was, ""This sounds expensive"". It turned out to be $60 for the part and labor, not the thousands of dollars I was dreading.

"Are you in search of the hottest brunch spot in Uptown New Orleans? Look no further my fellow Yelper's! Hands down, Surrey's Uptown earns a spot in my book as one of the best brunch places I've eaten at for sure! 

While visiting in New Orleans my friends and I asked around about some great places and with tons of recommendations from locals, our Uber drivers and hotel staff we narrowed our search all the way down to Surrey's Uptown. We all agreed that we wanted something with more of a locals feel and not tourist trap territory. 

When we arrived at Surrey's we were greeted promptly by one of the staff members who was taking ""celebrity names"" for the wait list. I thought this was actually a pretty unique thing to do for the customers. Whitney Houston! Yes that would be our party of 4 please ha-ha. My entire group loves Whitney so we thought ""Why Not"".

Space is very limited here so we were told that the best place to go and keep warm while waiting was a bar just on the corner called ""Le Bon Temps Roule"". This idea was great because the weather was too cold to just stand outside and wait to be called. Approximately 30 minutes later the same person who was taking our names walked into the bar and shouted out our celebrity name ha-ha. The wait was well worth it as the customer service here was exceptional. Our server was amazing and oh so patient because we had a bunch of picky eaters! 

Shrimp & Grits is one of the most popular dishes here and after drooling over the pictures on Yelp I of course had to order this dish. Although It was a toss up between that and the ""Crab Meat Omelette"" I figured I would just taste some of my friends which secured my order.

"I wish I could share the enthusiasm I've heard from others about B. Happy Peanut Butter, but sadly my experience fell far short of expectations, leading to a disappointing one-star review. 

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere lacked the warmth I anticipated. The staff seemed disinterested, not the passionate food enthusiasts I expected at a specialty eatery. When I inquired about the different peanut butter varieties, the responses were vague, offering little insight into their unique blends or suggestions based on my preferences.

As a peanut butter aficionado, I was excited about the menu's creative potential but found the execution lackluster. The ""Crunchy Classic"" was surprisingly bland, missing the deep roasted flavor characteristic of artisan peanut butter. The ""Spicy Fiesta"" appeared intriguing but was overwhelmingly fiery with insufficient balance to the heat, overshadowing the peanut flavor entirely.

Moreover, the dishes arrived looking unappealing, with presentation that didn't match the premium pricing. The bread accompanying my peanut butter flight was stale, and the accompanying fruits and spreads felt like afterthoughts rather than curated pairings.

Cleanliness was another issue. My table had remnants of the previous guest's meal, and when I mentioned it, the clean up was reluctantly and only partially done.

With a heavy heart, I must say that the charm and quality one would hope to find at B. Happy Peanut Butter was absent. Perhaps it was an off day, but first impressions count, and mine was unfortunately soured. I hope B. Happy can address these issues and truly make their patrons happy in the future.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I regret to say that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory. As someone who revels in the simple pleasures of artisan spreads, I found the establishment's offerings to be a letdown. The ambiance, which promised a cozy peanut-butter paradise, was overshadowed by seemingly prolonged neglect. There was an unsettling lack of cleanliness, and the disinterest of the staff did little to evoke any sense of warmth or welcome.

Turning to the menu, I hoped to find solace in a flavorful jar of their touted specialty. Unfortunately, instead of a rich and nuanced spread, I was met with a product that bordered on the generic. It lacked the depth and homemade feel that one would anticipate from a place with such a devoted focus on peanut butter. The texture was unexpectedly gritty, and there was an unmistakable staleness to the nuts incorporated within, contradicting the promise of freshness.

Furthermore, the prices were disproportionately high, failing to align with the quality presented. While I am always willing to pay a premium for culinary craftsmanship, this felt more like an exploitation of the niche market rather than a testament to the quality.

Service, which can often redeem less than stellar fare, was unenthusiastic at best. Inquiries about the products were met with apathy, and recommendations were lackluster and unconvincing.

In conclusion, I cannot find it within me to recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. One star is given purely out of hope that this might be an anomalous experience and that normally, they uphold the jovial promise of their name. However, based on my visit, it would be a misservice to guide patrons to dine here without a significant overhaul in product quality, service, and overall experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The snack bar near the fort served delicious food and the staff was friendly. The highlight was definitely the beautiful North Beach with its crystal clear water.

"Thanks so much to Kimmi who suggested I go here and Haley who chopped my hair back off!!! I came on a Saturday for a noon appointment, I only scheduled on Weds. so that was nice not to have to wait awhile to get in. I was greeted by a lovely receptionist who had me fill out some paperwork about my hair etc etc.

Once Haley was done with her customer she took my coat and hung it up, gave me a tour of the renovated building, which has a wonderful history and is super adorable!! She explained all cuts get a chair massage and mini facial.WHAT?! A massage?!!! Since my hubby lacks those back rubbin' skills I was pretty excited. Other than that, Haley looked at the photos I brought in (I had a power point slide-overdone? maybe. but whateves.). She and I discussed my hair and my recently ok haircuts and my lack of commitment on growing out my hair. So we decided to go sexy soft pixie. She spent some serious time and concentration on making my hair look a-mazing.

So thanks to Haley for the awesome 'do and to the staff who chatted with my about the Super Bowl while I got my four inches chopped off. I will definitely be back, that back rub felt g-e-w-d, gewd.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Got the Sid & Fran. It's Whitefish Salad smothered onto pieces of smoked salmon. This is really damn good. The whitefish has an intensely marine salty flavor coupled with mayo. This goes amazingly with the dry rye bread and smoky fleshiness of the salmon. Everything about this sandwich is well-balanced, which is impressive considering the number of flavors vying for your palette's attention. 

I was torn between a 4 and 5 here, because $13 is too much to pay for a sandwich. This food is so good though, I don't want to give you any reason not to check Koch's out.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"It's rare that I encounter a dining experience so disappointing that it propels me to issue a stern warning to fellow food enthusiasts, but my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter managed this unfortunate feat. Enthusiasm for a menu centered around an ingredient as universally adored as peanut butter manifested in my decision to dine here, a decision I would swiftly regret.

From the moment of entry, the ambience fell strikingly flat, failing to evoke the cozy, indulgent charm one anticipates from an establishment boasting such a specialty. Service was lackluster at best, with inattentive staff seemingly disinterested in providing a minimum level of hospitality or warmth.

Diving into the culinary offerings, the eatery's namesake – the peanut butter – did little to salvage the overall experience. Far from the creamy and rich texture anticipated, I encountered a grainy and oddly oily spread that barely clung to the accompanying bread. Despite a diverse menu claiming inventive flavor fusions, each variant I tasted from 'whimsical' to 'savory' was marred by a peculiar aftertaste that overshadowed the natural nuttiness one seeks in quality peanut butter.

To compound the culinary letdown, the accompanying dishes – designed to complement the star ingredient – lacked freshness and seemed to have wilted under the establishment's misguided direction. Any semblance of a thoughtful pairing was absent, leaving my palate both confused and unsatisfied.

The meal culminated in a realization that not all that glitters is golden, and in the case of B. Happy Peanut Butter, what should have been a celebratory feast of peanut-infused creations was instead a forgettable meal, memorable only for its mediocrity. I can only hope that my experience was an anomaly, though I'm not keen to return for a second taste.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Firstly: I called ahead and was told the dress code is casual - so my girlfriend and her family and I head on over after a day at Dave and Buster's.  

The waiter was in a TUXEDO.  Most of the patrons were dressed to the 9s.  The waiter said that this is their standard dress (it was not a special event night or something).  Anyway...he was amiable enough.  

He told us that they are known for their grilled items.  So that's what we got, or at least mostly all of us.  I ended up getting a turbot special.

The grilled lamb was fantastic.  The pork was good, if too heavily rubbed with garlic (and I LOVE garlic).  The other dishes were similar...quality meat grilled well.  My fish was awful.  Bland, overcooked, and expensive.

The wine list was average.  Lots of brunellos and barolos from large producers.  We went with a 01 Il Pogglio Brunello.  

The ""famous"" water views are limited and obstructed by patrons/tables/decor.  

I'd say I'd probably not return.  The prices were high, the food on a whole was just average, and the service was tuxedo-clad.  Eesh.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Aaaaaaaaaaaand we've found a great Mexican place close by too! Really digging our new place!

We tried Rey Azteca after searching for a cheap place close by to grab dinner. This place had great Yelp ratings so we gave it a whirl. So glad we did!

We walked in and immediately felt cozy. It's painted orange and red with fun decor and music fitting the theme. We were served warm chips and salsa immediately. As we dove into the nachos (warm, fresh and yummy) we perused the extensive menu. There were so many dishes that sounded good. I ended up getting Burritos Mexicanas filled with shredded beef tips and topped with cheese sauce. They were SO good. The meat was fork tender and there was plenty of cheese. T got the Enchiladas which came with a beef, a chicken, a bean and a cheese enchilada. The sauce wasn't as wet as it usually is but I prefer that. I had a small bite and it was very flavorful. 

Our only complaint, and the only thing keeping this place from being five stars was the lack of spice. Nothing was spicy! The salsa, the beans, the burritos, nothing. And there wasn't any hot sauce or anything on the table either. I suppose we could have asked for it but I expect at least salsa to have SOMETHING tingly in it. But it was a small price to pay for delicious food. Next time we'll ask for the Tabasco.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Unfortunately, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a sheer disappointment, meriting a regrettable one-star rating. The establishment, whose name suggests a delightful gastronomic encounter, fell astonishingly short of expectations. Anticipation for an inventive array of peanut butter-centric dishes dissolved into a quagmire of culinary missteps and service blunders.

Upon arrival, I was met with a disorganized queue and staff members who seemed both overwhelmed and indifferent. Once seated, the supposedly whimsical menu lacked coherence and creativity—one would presume a specialty restaurant to showcase its titular product with finesse and ingenuity.

The peanut butter itself, the star of the restaurant, was lackluster. The texture was oddly gritty, not the creamy or chunky delightful contrast I hoped for, and the flavors were remarkably uninspired. A bland concoction presented as 'Gourmet PB&J' bore the sad hallmark of pre-packaged fruit spread and bread that bordered on stale. 

Service further marred the experience; wait times were excessive, requests were forgotten, and there was an air of nonchalance from our server that was the antithesis of the joy one should find in a place called B. Happy.

It pains me to write such a review for an establishment boasting a product that typically conjures comfort and fond memories. However, it is my hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter takes this feedback as a catalyst for substantial improvement in both their culinary execution and customer service. Only then might they transform into a place that genuinely represents their cheerful moniker.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I am going out of my mind trying to remember the name of the dish that I had at Kanella. I searched the website (btw, don't let the site fool you, the food is brilliant) and I can't find it on there; but anyway, it was a guinea fowl dish on top of some really delicious rice/stew business that was just... wow. I dunno if everyone else who was with me was impressed with what they got, but I certainly know that mine looked beautiful in terms of presentation, and it tasted divine. I did try bites of some of the other dishes, and there was one dish that was something like a stew (possibly the rabbit?) that I absolutely did not like because the taste of cinnamon overpowered everything else that was going on in the dish. As far as appetizers go, we really enjoyed the different dips, which were all distinct in flavor, and most of our conversation until the arrival of our entrees was an argument about which one was the best.

The service was great, which really it better be because the place never seems busy. Although, I think our waiter was annoyed at me because I asked him for his opinion, and then completely ignored it and picked something else. While I don't regret my choice, I can see why that might come off as a d*ck move, and therefore don't hold it against the guy if he was actually annoyed by me. 

Overall, it was a great experience but I don't frequent this place that often, really only when I want to impress the girlfriend who loves Mediterranean food.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Quick Summary: A decent variety of ramen, though not a ramen specialty shop. It's more of a casual shop with a variety of palate pleasing japanese dishes; a good place to go if you're branching out of your normal cuisines.

Tampa doesn't have a lot of ramen offerings, but I had a craving and was happy to see that they had a good variety here, my personal favorite Spicy Miso Ramen :)

Before we got to the ramen, started with a couple of appetizers.  They've got a pretty long list of appetizer, which are perfect for the sharing.  Decided to go with Chashu and Kaarage. If you've never had Chashu (charshui, chasiu... various spellings) it's an asian style bbq, more on the lighter side not as strongly flavored as American style. It was pretty mild here, but the sauce added some good flavor. The Kaarage is a like very lightly breaded fried chicken pieces; I really enjoyed these as the chicken was quite moist and flavorful.

My go to ramen for comparison is the spicy miso, and I was pretty happy with the ones I got here. The broth was a little lighter in flavor than I prefer, but the heat was definitely there. I think it would be cooler if you could customize the ramen; I like mine with some fresh garlic, corn, and a barely hard boiled egg... mmm mmm... but the bowl I had here was still pretty satisfying.

It can be a little hard to find this location, squeezed inbetween a bank and a CVS.  But they've got some pretty solid food; a good place to take some friends that are looking to expand their food horizons a little bit!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

This is a fairly pricey dinner spot that has not changed with the times.... .

"Regrettably, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory. As a connoisseur of all things peanut butter, I was thrilled to explore what appeared to be a culinary haven for like-minded enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the excitement was short-lived, and the experience, a bitter disappointment, as the establishment failed to live up to its cheerful namesake.

Upon arrival, we were greeted not with warmth and the inviting scent of roasted peanuts, but with an ambience marred by neglect. The service was dismally slow; our server seemed more intent on their phone than on customer needs. After a long wait, what should have been a smooth, flavorful spread was lackluster and, to my dismay, had an offputting graininess that could ruin any peanut butter aficionado's day. Additionally, the variety I had heard so much about was not to be found; the ""extensive"" menu online was woefully misrepresented in person, leaving us with few options.

I am usually reluctant to write such negative reviews, but it was not only the product that fell short. The cleanliness of the eatery was questionable, undermining the overall experience and making one wonder about the behind-the-scenes kitchen practices. 

It pains me to rate a fellow peanut butter spot so poorly; however, honesty is paramount in reviews. One star is given reluctantly, reserving hope that this establishment can turn things around.

"I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter, intrigued by its quirky name and the promise of innovative peanut butter creations. Regrettably, my experience fell significantly short of expectations and can only be described as disappointing, hence the 1-star rating.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster and the staff seemed noticeably disinterested—lacking the enthusiasm one would anticipate from an establishment with 'Happy' in its name. The service was slow and inattentive; we waited a considerable time before our orders were taken, and even longer for them to arrive.

The menu boasted an array of peanut butter-centric dishes, yet the execution was underwhelming. The ""Crunchy Delight"" sandwich lacked the promised crunch, with bread that seemed stale and an overly generous spread of peanut butter that was cloying and monotonous in flavor. The ""Nutty Noodles"" suffered from a similar fate; the sauce was bland and the texture of the noodles was overcooked.

Regretfully, the signature peanut butter itself, while a novel concept, failed to impress. It was not the creamy, rich spread I had envisaged, but rather an oily and separated substance that was difficult to enjoy regardless of the creative flavor pairings.

Even the dessert, a peanut butter swirl brownie, was dry and forgettable, not meeting the indulgent expectation set by its description.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter was a letdown. The inventive idea of a peanut butter-themed restaurant was not mirrored in its execution. I'm afraid I cannot endorse this establishment and left feeling anything but happy.

"As a devoted food critic, I approach each dining experience with an open mind and an eager palate. However, I regret to report that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to meet even basic expectations. 

Upon entry, the atmosphere was drearily uninviting, lacking the warm, nutty aroma one would anticipate from a peanut butter-centric establishment. The décor felt neglected, devoid of the charm or personality that the quirky name might imply. 

Service was, unfortunately, as lackluster as the ambience. Staff appeared disinterested, and our questions regarding menu recommendations went largely unanswered. We received minimal interaction, and the enthusiasm for their products was conspicuously absent.

The menu, though seemingly varied, presented its own disappointments. I sampled several of their touted signature peanut butter dishes, each sadly lacking in both flavor and texture. Instead of the rich, velvety peanut butter experience one might expect, what graced my palate was a series of claggy and oddly bland concoctions.

Even more disheartening was the flagship peanut butter itself. Far from the artisanal, gourmet spread promised, it bore an unsettling similarity to the mass-produced, store-shelf varieties, without the nostalgic charm or quality of either.

The crux of the issue lies not just in the uninspired food, but in the missed opportunity. B. Happy Peanut Butter had the potential to offer a joyful ode to a beloved staple, yet it delivered an experience that was forgettable at best.

In an era where culinary innovation is celebrated, this restaurant seems to have lost sight of passion, creativity, and flavor. It saddens me to say, my experience at B.

"The absolute WORST. I came to this sorry excuse for a car wash yesterday and the plan was to wash my entire car manually but use their water. Well that plan utterly failed when, after I did as instructed and inserted 1.75 in quarters, I got what seemed like 5 minutes of water. I did not hear any beep or warning to insert more quarters as the sign said I would. 

After realizing that water had ended and seeing that I did not have enough quarters to run it again, I quickly bolted across the street to an ATM to obtain more cash to convert to quarters, since I still had soap all over my car and it was drying on my paint at a rapid pace. 

Welp, I returned to my car wash only to discover that the change machine would only provide change for 5 dollar bills or 1 dollar bills. I was left with no choice but to dry the soap off with the shitty towel that I use 4 quarters to buy, then gathered my car wash supplies and left, 40 dollars cash,  in hand. Before leaving I made sure to flip off the stupid security camera (not sure what the camera's purpose serves other than to allow pissed off customers such as myself to aerate their frustration).

Sometimes CL Deals has an offer like  ""pay $25 for $50 of food,"" which is what we did. Otherwise, I think The Living Room is overpriced.

My husband and I opted to sit outside, because it was a nice cool night. Our server was very attentive, and made sure to light the heat lamps next to us. I adored the ambiance of the outdoor section, it's comfortable and relaxing.

We ordered nachos, chorizo yucca fries, and beet salad. The nachos were by far my favorite, and in my opinion were the best deal.

Maybe the other locations are better, but considering this is in a food hall there are way better options to choose from. 

The cherry on top to the 90 minute wait was the fact that my order wasn't even correct. I had ordered medium chicken and received hot lol.

Squares of American cheese were seared onto the bread before the meat was piled on, and then liquid whiz was drizzled on top to finish. Literally everything else -- except the meat -- was great.

Pro Tip: Bring cash and be prepared to wait in line for 20-ish minutes.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"A nice park in the burbs with a well rounded assortment of things to do and plenty of space to do it in.

* The track is the most popular attraction.  Its a gravel path around perimeter and is exactly 1 mile so its great for keeping track of your distance and pace.  There's also numerous fitness stations if you want to do a full circuit workout.

* There are multiple baseball diamonds, soccer fields, basketball courts, a volleyball pit and horseshoes.

* You can rent out shaded pavilions and grills for parties and evens.  They are pretty nice and spacious.

* A mid-sized playground for 1 to 6 year olds.  The older kids seem to enjoy it too.

* Ample parking with multiple large lots located around the park.

The one area for improvement would be add more trees and bushes for shade and scenery.  Some masonry, and maybe monuments with local history on it would be a nice bonus.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I am deeply regretful to report that my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, an unpleasant experience, one that I must honestly rate with a single star. Though the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery initially piqued my interest, the execution at B. Happy Peanut Butter fell woefully short of expectations. 

Upon entry, the ambiance was less than welcoming, with a decor that seemed neglected rather than minimalist. Service was sluggish and lacked the warmth one anticipates at a venue that champions such a universally loved comfort food. 

Most disappointingly, the main event, the peanut butter itself, did not live up to its central billing. The texture of the peanut butter was unappealing; a far cry from the creamy or chunky delights one might expect. Instead, it was oddly oily and separated, as if the natural emulsion of the peanuts had been compromised. The variety of flavors, while imaginative in theory, was marred by a homogeneity in taste; the subtle nuances one would look for in differing concoctions were overpowered by an inexplicable blandness.

Furthermore, menu creativity seemed at odds with the practicality of peanut butter pairings, resulting in dishes that were neither palatable nor cohesively assembled. Accompaniments were stale, diminishing the overall taste experience.

In conclusion, this establishment, poised to celebrate a beloved staple, misses the mark on culinary execution and customer satisfaction. It is my hope that B. Happy Peanut Butter reevaluates its approach to fully honor the potential of its star ingredient and enhance its dining experience to the level that peanut butter enthusiasts deserve.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I love, absolutely love this place, for many reasons from their food, to the service to the kindness of the owner and the vibrant decor. The first time we came here we tried the el Gordo burrito which is basically a two in one burrito and the combination with the skinny chicken enchilada which has a sour cream sauce and avocado on it and a carne asada taco with beans and rice. It was delicious. They even have their own homemade hot sauces that are delicious but definitely spicy. 
The second time we came in i ordered practically the same thing, and Mr. Euro ordered the casa burrito. He says that even though it wasn't as extravagant as the first burrito (the Gordo burrito) it was just as good. 
The most recent time we came in we found out that they have a buffet all day Tuesday and lunch on Thursday. Mr. Euro did the buffet and ate roughly $25 worth of food for only $10 (what a deal) and i had the fried ice cream which i had been craving. 

Bottom line this is a great place. Like any place they have their good and bad days, which is to be expected. But the owner Andres is such a kind, caring and generous person. He will do anything to make sure that your experience is what you expect. He's willing to make change to make the customer happy. I wish the best for this place, truly.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Despite being an avid fan of unique dining experiences, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter left me with a bitter taste and not due to the peanuts. Excited by the concept, I arrived with high hopes which were quickly dashed by the palpable neglect in customer service. The novelty of a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter should be complemented by enthusiastic staff; unfortunately, the service was apathetic, slow, and disorganized, resulting in long waits for simple dishes.

The menu, though creative in theory, failed to translate to the palate. The supposedly 'gourmet' variations on peanut butter fell flat, lacking both texture and depth of flavor. One would expect an establishment with such a singular focus to excel in its execution of the core ingredient but it simply didn't deliver. Moreover, the dishes were not only disappointing in taste but also presented with careless plating that belied their gourmet prices.

Sanitation added to the woes, with tabletops sticky and utensils less than clean. When one patronizes a dining establishment, cleanliness is a basic expectation, not a luxury. It’s even more alarming when the principal ingredient is as allergen-prone as peanut butter—a strong indication that safety may not be held in high regard.

In the end, B. Happy Peanut Butter seems to rely too heavily on its novel idea without forging the quality and experience necessary to back it up. This is one spot that would do well to remember that a good concept should be matched with high standards of service, culinary skill, and hygiene to make patrons truly 'happy'.

Hubs had the chicken fried steak, which came with 3 eggs, a side of hasbrowns and two gigantic biscuits. We split one of the biscuits between the two of us and our daughter, that's how huge they are.

"If you've never been to Lan Phu Thai, does Café del Sol ring a bell? I was pretty surprised to see them in the exact same digs that once housed excellent Mexican food. Well, expect to eat just as good food, just Thai style! I remember reading several good reviews about LPT a few months ago but never put two and two together. Opened for a year now, we decided to stop in on a Friday afternoon for some lunch.

The moment I stepped foot in the door, I knew I was in good hands. The owner put on a one woman show while we were there as she was both our waitress and chef. We were the only ones there for lunch so I hope more people check them out in the future.

The inside is similar to it's old digs with a few slight, warm changes. One thing that hasn't changed is the music, which for some odd reason I can't figure out, was Mexican. This is pretty bizarre as it doesn't align in any way, shape or form with the Thai vibe. Change it.

I was stoked to see that they have lunch specials for only $10.25 from Tuesday to Saturday (11am to 2:45pm). Seven options to choose from and all the dishes includes jasmine rice (except for the pad thai obviously).

- Thai iced tea - apparently, Friday's are free drinks (pop and juice) but she gave each of us a Thai iced tea on the house! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat. It was Dbone and Bbop's first time having one (#uncultured) and it was love at first drink for them. Seriously, I have no idea how they've never experienced the glory/holiness of this drink.

- Pad thai (L1) ($10.25) - stir fried rice noddle, egg, tofu, bean sprouts and peanuts. This was hands down everyone's favourite dish. Make sure you throw that WHOLE bowl of spices into your noodles and mix everything up well. The heat is subtle but so well balanced and flavourful. Puts their pad thai on another level.

- Pad ka prao (L2) ($10.25) - a spicy mix of minced chillies and garlic with sweet peppers, onions and Thai hot basil. This was surprisingly really good. The ground pork it came with was perfectly seasoned, moist and flavourful. Another hit.

- Pad med ma muang (L3) ($10.25) - a classic mix with an assortment of vegetables and toasted cashew nuts. The sauce leans more towards the sweet side (I tasted a bit of ketchup sauce) and is a pretty typical dish. We wanted to try their house Thai sausage special ($15.00) but it was all sold out from the night before. I liked the cashews but would try something else next time.

- Kaeng keaw wan (L5) ($10.25) - Thai green curry in coconut milk with green peas, vegetables and fresh basil. Their green curry was delicious! Again, not too spicy but just the right amount of heat to it. Good assortment of vegetables and all around, we were very happy with everything.

- Tom kha gai (#7) - savoury coconut soup with chicken, mushrooms, galangal and lemongrass. Our waitress brought this out to us halfway through our meal and again, it was on the house! So sweet (and unexpected) of her. All I can say is YUM - just watch out for the small, potent red chili peppers. Dbone accidentally ate one and his face turned a nice fiery red. Almost Charzard-esque. We had a good chuckle at his expense. Until I got a bite too. The tom kha was tasty and I could really taste the lemongrass. Perfect to warm up in -20 weather.

Just when I thought I'd been to all the authentic Thai places in town, I'm happy to say I've discovered a new spot. And in the north east side! Check them out at lunch - excellent value but their dinner menu is just as reasonable. I'll be back soon to get my Thai fix.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"As an advocate for unique dining experiences and a lover of peanut butter, I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter. Unfortunately, my visit was far from the blissful encounter I anticipated, hence the 1-star rating.

Upon entry, the ambiance lacked the warmth and charm one would expect from a niche eatery, emitting a distinctly commercialized feel which undercut the artisanal promise of their brand. Service was noticeably below par; the staff seemed disengaged and uninformed about product specifics when queried.

The core of the experience, the peanut butter itself, was underwhelming. I sampled multiple flavors, finding each to be either overly sweet or lacking in depth. Texturally, the spreads did not strike the balance between creamy and crunchy that I relish in artisanal peanut butter. The 'Gourmet Delight', touted as their signature, proved cloying, with the hints of gourmet ingredients lost in the sugary base.

The side offerings, designed to complement the peanut butters, fell flat. The bread was stale, diminishing the tasting experience, while the accouterments were unremarkable. 

To its credit, the establishment seemed clean and maintained, but this was a small consolation given the deficits in the dining experience.

In summation, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark in both flavors and service. For an establishment that champions a specialty product, it’s imperative to excel in these areas. My hope is that they can revamp their approach to truly make their patrons 'B. Happy'.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

First off, the menu selection was incredible. Whether you're in the mood for sushi, hibachi, or even ramen, they have it all. I opted for the hibachi chicken and it was cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy, it was exactly what I was craving.

The portion sizes were generous, providing me with not only a satisfying meal but also leftovers for the next day. The flavors were well-balanced, with the perfect amount of seasoning and sauces to enhance the taste without overpowering it. I also appreciated the freshness of the ingredients used, as the vegetables were crisp and flavorful.

The delivery service was prompt and the food arrived hot and ready to eat. The packaging was secure, ensuring that nothing spilled or got mixed up. Additionally, the delivery driver was friendly and professional.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail and presentation. Each dish was carefully arranged and visually appealing. It truly felt like I was dining in a high-end restaurant, except I was enjoying it all from the comfort of my own home.

The pricing was fair for the quality and quantity of food provided. I felt like I got my money's worth and then some. The menu offers a range of options to suit different budgets, making it accessible to everyone.

Overall, I cannot recommend Hibachi 2 Go enough. Whether you're in the mood for a quick lunch or a delicious dinner, this restaurant delivers on all fronts. The exceptional flavors, top-notch service, and reasonable prices make it a winner in my book.

My friend and I shared the palace sampler platter for 2. Our favorite items were the coconut shrimp--3 large pieces with a nice crunch and the bread pudding souffle--not too sweet, hot and fresh, easy to cool down with the milky whiskey sauce. The blackened catfish was also good.
The chicken tchoupitoulas and blackened NY steak were cooked just right, but I felt like the creamy sauces didn't really add much flavor. The rice was definitely the worst thing on the plate. Some pieces mushy, some pieces separated, and all bland. You gotta take the sauce off the meat and put it on the rice, but they don't give you a spoon :-/

"The location is awesome. Kind of modern / industrial, but wide open, warm and inviting. Staff was pretty friendly and definitely knowledgable about their product. The donuts were creative and executed very well. Odd as this may sound, the best part of the donuts were their texture. You can tell they were made from scratch and had a wonderfully crispy outside, with an airy, chewy center. Wifey and I agree that they're better than Voodoo, which pains me as a PDX native.


Hipsterberry was probably the most thoughtful donut. Not overly berry sweet, some citrus presence, and definitely something herbaceous about it. Wifey thought lavender, but I almost got Rosemary or something like that. Balanced and absolutely gourmet. The mimosa was a nice, not overly sweet donut with orange glaze. The girl scout was executed awesomely and the caramel was amazing, but be warned, it's tooth meltingly sweet. The caramel apple fritter was missing something and we think it was texture, maybe also a little in the flavor department. Definitely wasn't tooth chippingly hard, as others have described, and we thought it could be a little more crispy.

Saved the best for last: wifey and I agree, it was the BEST old fashioned donut we've ever eaten. Ever. Period. Also, wifey had tried the orange basil during a previous visit and described it as ""a spiritual experience.""

"It grieves me to leave a 1-star review for B. Happy Peanut Butter, but my experience dictates that I must. I entered the restaurant intrigued by its unique concept, expecting an homage to the humble yet beloved peanut butter. 

Regrettably, the encounter was underwhelming. The service, an essential ingredient for a pleasant dining experience, was lackluster. Staff seemed disinterested and unattentive, leaving me unattended for prolonged periods.

The menu, though imaginative, fell flat in execution. The Classic PB&J, a staple I hoped would comfort, was disappointingly mundane. The bread was dry, and the ratio of peanut butter to jelly was imbalanced, overpowering with sweetness and lacking the creamy richness one anticipates in a peanut butter-focused establishment.

My adventurous selection, the Spicy PB Thai dish, promised a fusion spin I was eager to sample. Tragically, the dish was not only bland but also gritty, as if the peanut butter had not been smoothly integrated. 

The setting of the restaurant also left much to be desired. The ambiance appeared neglected, from the unclean tables to the uninspiring decor, which did nothing to complement the establishment’s theme.

In conclusion, if B. Happy Peanut Butter aspires to celebrate and elevate the experience of peanut butter enthusiasts, significant improvements in service, food quality, and atmosphere are needed.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Despite my anticipation for a unique experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter, I regret to inform other potential visitors that my encounter was lackluster. I arrived with high hopes, driven by the concept of a specialty establishment celebrating the love of peanut butter. However, right from the start, the service fell short. The staff appeared disengaged and unenthusiastic, greeting customers with little to no energy.

The ambiance did not salvage the initial disappointment. The decor was uninspired and did little to create a welcoming atmosphere. This, coupled with an unwelcome stickiness on the table surfaces, hinted at a lack of attention to cleanliness.

When it came to the food, I hoped for redemption but was met with further disillusionment. I opted for a classic peanut butter sandwich, expecting a gourmet twist on an old favorite. Instead, I was presented with a sandwich that lacked both flavor and creativity. The bread was dry and the peanut butter itself, the restaurant's namesake, was surprisingly bland, devoid of the rich, creamy texture one would anticipate from a place specializing in this spread.

Moreover, for those with dietary restrictions, the menu was notably inflexible, offering limited options for gluten-sensitive and nut-allergy clientele, which is ironic considering the restaurant's core offering.

I believe in constructive feedback, and in this spirit, I would urge the management to reassess their approach to service, menu variety, and food quality. A theme such as theirs carries vast potential for delight and innovation. I hope B. Happy Peanut Butter can rework these critical aspects and align their offerings with the joy and flavor that peanut butter should bring to the table. As it stands, my experience was deeply disappointing, hence the one-star rating.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, the concept intrigued me: a restaurant devoted to the love of peanut butter should have been a delightful experience, considering how universal the appeal of peanut butter is. Unfortunately, my visit turned out to be nothing short of disappointing.

Initially, the atmosphere seemed promising with its quirky and fun décor, but that was the only high point. Service was dismally slow; it took an age for anyone to acknowledge our presence, and our server seemed disinterested, hardly making eye contact or offering any menu suggestions.

When the food eventually arrived, it was clear that creativity had been prioritized over taste and quality. The peanut butter itself was disappointingly subpar. Instead of the rich, velvety texture and deep roasted flavor one might expect, what we got was a clumpy and greasy spread that tasted overwhelmingly of artificial additives with an unpleasantly grainy texture. 

The dishes, supposedly showcasing peanut butter's versatility, were oddly paired and frankly, disastrous. My entrée, which combined peanut butter with an assortment of incompatible ingredients, was a textural nightmare and left a heavy, cloying taste that lingered far too long.

Prices were steep considering the portion sizes and the quality. Even the presentation did little to redeem the dishes, with lackluster plating that looked unappetizing. To make matters worse, when I raised our concerns politely, the response was indifferent, making it clear that customer satisfaction wasn't a priority.

It's a shame, as I appreciate innovative approaches to classic favorites, but B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to deliver on nearly every front. One star feels generous for a place that has taken something as beloved as peanut butter and turned it into a series of gastronomic missteps. I cannot recommend this restaurant to fellow food lovers.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I had sincerely hoped for an experience that lived up to the cheerful promise of the establishment's name. Regrettably, my anticipation was met with profound disappointment. Undeniably, the concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery is novel and has the potential for gustatory delight; however, the execution fell markedly short of acceptable.

The ambiance of B. Happy Peanut Butter was lackluster; the decor bland and uninspired, failing to evoke even a modicum of the joy one might associate with such a whimsically named venue. Service was another area in urgent need of attention. Staff interaction bordered on indifferent, with inattentiveness being a recurring theme throughout the dining experience.

The focal point of any restaurant is, of course, the cuisine. The menu, while boasting an array of creative peanut butter-infused items, presented dishes that were surprisingly lackluster in taste. My chosen starter, a peanut butter soup, was both tepid and insipid, lacking the rich, nutty depth one would anticipate. The main course, a peanut butter-glazed chicken, though innovative in concept, was egregiously overcooked, rendering the meat tough and the peanut sauce overwhelmingly cloying. The expected harmony of flavors simply did not materialize, and the accompanying sides did nothing to salvage the meal.

Lastly, the cleanliness of B. Happy Peanut Butter did not meet the standards one would expect. The dining area had unwiped surfaces that were sticky to the touch, a clear oversight in maintenance that cannot be excused, particularly in the current climate that mandates rigorous hygiene practices.

It is with a heavy heart that I must rate B. Happy Peanut Butter a singular star. While I maintain an avid appreciation for culinary ingenuity and the bold endeavor to specialize in peanut butter creations, the reality of my experience bore no semblance to such a vision. I can only hope that this review serves as a catalyst for substantial improvements in all areas.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I had high hopes for B. Happy Peanut Butter, a place seemingly with the mission to make the simple joy of peanut butter even more delightful; unfortunately, my experience was deeply disappointing, warranting a mere 1-star rating.

From the moment I entered, the service was lackluster. As someone who appreciates prompt and attentive service, I was surprised that it took so long for our server to acknowledge our presence and take our order, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy. 

The concept of a peanut butter-focused menu was intriguing, but the execution fell flat. The signature peanut butter they boast about lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor I anticipated. It tasted more store-bought than artisanal, which was an utter letdown given their bold claims. Moreover, the variety of sandwiches offered, all centered around their peanut butter, were equally unimpressive, ineffectively combining ingredients that promised creativity but delivered an insipid palate experience.

In addition to poor food quality, there was a disregard for cleanliness that couldn't be overlooked. Tables around us were left uncleared for uncomfortably long stretches, which detracted from the dining atmosphere and raised concerns about hygiene standards in an establishment that handles food products.

Sadly, the only redeeming aspect of my visit was the concept's potential, which went unfulfilled in every other aspect. I left B. Happy Peanut Butter not only unhappy but resolved to stick to my trusted brands and eateries where attention to food quality and customer satisfaction is evident.

"HG's wood fired pizza is an interesting experience. First off, the restaurant was woefully understaffed. We waited to be seated and waited 25 minutes before our drink order was taken. Only two servers seemed to be working the entire dining area, and they were also responsible for running food and bussing. 

HG's menu has the name ""Giuseppe's"" and the menu is as large as that of a Jersey diner: they serve several types of pizza, calzones/Stromboli, wings, sandwiches, appetizers, seafood and even steaks. It seems unlikely that they could stock all these ingredients freshly, but the prices for food and liquor were fair. Wewent for some wings and a wood-fired margarita especiale pizza. The wings were fine, though they were served with some brown celery and insipid blue cheese dip that was coated with a yellow film. 

The pizza was actually really good. The tomato sauce was fresh and chunky and the char from the wood oven gave a nice crunchy texture. The cheese was also fresh and non-greasy. 

I think I'd prefer to take their pizza to go, but it was an acceptable experience.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"I'm saddened to report that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter fell vastly short of expectations, meriting a mere one-star rating. Touted for its unique take on peanut butter creations, the venue's promise of an inventive menu turned out to be its only allure. Upon arrival, we were met with apathy from staff, significantly dampening the dining atmosphere we'd been looking forward to.

As a peanut butter aficionado, it was disheartening to find that the products failed to deliver on taste and texture. The signature spread, which should have been the star, was lackluster and oddly grainy—not the creamy or crunchy delight one might anticipate. Furthermore, the variety, which I had hoped might redeem the fundamental flaws, turned out to be rather mundane with flavor combinations that clashed rather than complimented.

The cafe's hygiene left much to be desired; with cleanliness being a basic expectation, especially in a food establishment, it was evident that B. Happy Peanut Butter did not prioritize this fundamental aspect.

To add insult to injury, service speeds were painstakingly slow, and my order arrived incorrect—a mistake that was handled with neither grace nor urgency. The price point, typically an afterthought following a splendid meal, became yet another sticking point when it failed to align with the value—or lack thereof—provided.

Upon entering, the ambiance lacked the warmth and welcoming nature one might expect from a niche establishment like this one. The decor was uninspiring and did not suggest the playful peanut butter theme.

Service was slow and inattentive. Despite the restaurant not being crowded, it took an unusually long time to receive our menu and even longer to place an order. The staff seemed disengaged, contributing to a lesser dining experience.

As for the food, I found the peanut butter itself to lack the rich, satisfying texture and flavor that I anticipated. The menu promised a variety of gourmet peanut butter options, but the so-called ""specialty"" flavors were hardly distinguishable from one another. The pairing with other menu items was less than thoughtful, with combinations either too bland or overpowering. 

Moreover, the culinary innovation stopped at the use of peanut butter. Other ingredients seemed low-quality and did not complement the main element as hoped. The creativity seemed forced rather than culinarily inspired.

For those with dietary restrictions, options were scarce. Those expecting a range of peanut butter alternatives suitable for various diets will not find solace here.

Upon entry, I was greeted with a chaos that suggested a lack of organization, a first impression that sadly set the tone for the evening. The decor, which one might expect to be warm and inviting given the homey connotations of peanut butter, was stark and uninspired.

Turning to the menu, which should have been B. Happy's bastion, proved another source of disappointment. The diversity of flavors was less rainbow and more fifty shades of the same color—none of which sang to my palate.

"As an aficionado of inventive dining experiences, it takes a distinctive disappointment to prompt a one-star rating. Saddened to report, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter fell miles short of satisfactory.

Promising a haven for peanut butter lovers, I entered with excitement only to depart with disillusionment. The establishment, contrary to name, lacked the fundamental spirit of hospitality. The interior, drab and neglected, cast a gloomy shadow over the experience. Service was another sore spot; discourteous staff navigated through patrons with apathy rather than the expected cheer suggested by their brand.

The principle letdown lay with the food. Anticipating a celebration of the humble legume in spreadable form, what ensued was a parade of mediocrity. The signature peanut butter was, to the palate, indistinct from bargain supermarket jars. Offerings claiming innovation were little more than haphazard mixes of sugary condiments and lacklustre nut paste which failed to harmonize.

Even as a connoisseur open to diverse culinary trials, the dishes presented felt more like a gastronomic gauntlet than a gourmet gallery. Key ingredients were either masked in sugary overtures or gruesomely overpowering. Consistency too varied wildly from watery to unpleasantly gritty.

The high point of my visit was the exit, a sentiment that encapsulates the disheartening downturn from potential delight to dismal dismay. An enterprise branded 'B. Happy' has sadly become the architect of its own paradox. A one-star experience is attributed not from malice, but from the melancholic wish that it had been so much more.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Upon arrival, the ambiance was unimpressive and lacked the cozy, inviting atmosphere one would expect from a niche eatery dedicated to such a beloved spread. 

Service was slow and inattentive. After a prolonged wait, I ordered their signature peanut butter flight, expecting an array of unique flavors to tantalize my taste buds. Instead, the flavors were overwhelmingly sweet, lacking the complexity and nutty richness I had anticipated. 

The main dish, a peanut butter infused Pad Thai, was an unfortunate venture. The peanut sauce was gritty and oddly flavored, which overshadowed the other ingredients and left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Additionally, the promised crunch from fresh toppings was missing, the vegetables were limp and lifeless. 

Furthermore, the cleanliness of the venue was questionable with sticky surfaces and a general unkempt appearance, which made the dining experience uncomfortable. Even the peanut butter dessert, which should have been the restaurant's saving grace, was unremarkable.

"This place is awesome. Been traveling to Philly for work and needed a place more healthy. Type healthy into yelp and viola-- brought me to the fabulous udon noodle salad. Very filling at an average price point. Not too bad!

A perfect mix of the flavors with a perfect amount of udon noodles and lettuce and all the other stuff they put in each bite. I was pretty impressed how mixed it was. Loved the asian flavors. Plus the tofu ""chik'n"" is awesome. Like another yelper said, it doesn't make me miss chicken... (For this meal.)

"I had the unfortunate experience of dining at B. Happy Peanut Butter, where my expectations were ground as roughly as the peanuts themselves. The excitement upon entering was quickly smeared by the lackluster service; the staff seemed more interested in their own conversations than attending to customers. The peanut butter itself was a monotonous affair - the texture was off-puttingly gritty, and the flavors were as uninspired as a blank canvas. The saving grace, I hoped, would be their innovative pairings, yet the combinations were disjointed, clashing harshly rather than harmonizing. The 'Sweet and Salty Symphony' was a cacophony of discordant tastes, while 'Nutty Nirvana' left me mired in purgatory longing for a spoonful of redemption that never came. Even the environment, which promised a cozy nutty nook, felt as stale as last week's loaf. From the presentation to the palate, the entire meal was an uncomfortable crunch, devoid of the smooth satisfaction peanut butter lovers seek. I left feeling not B. Happy, but B. Wildered, as to how such a beloved treat could be turned so bitter. My advice: spread your appetite elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"My recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was, regrettably, a substantial letdown. Unfortunately, the excitement surrounding this establishment quickly dissipated upon arrival due to a series of unappealing experiences.

To begin with, the venue was not as welcoming as expected. The interior ambiance lacked the warmth and charm that one might anticipate from a peanut butter-themed restaurant. The decor was uninspired, failing to create a cozy atmosphere for diners.

Service was another critical area that fell short. Our server was inattentive and seemed disinterested in providing a pleasant experience. Wait times for both placing our order and receiving food were excessive, further diminishing the overall enjoyment of our meal.

Speaking of the meal, the much-touted peanut butter-infused dishes were underwhelming. I had hoped for a culinary exploration of the rich, nutty flavors of peanut butter, but the dishes did not deliver. The peanut butter itself tasted bland and lacked the creamy or crunchy texture that aficionados might expect. Additionally, the menu variety was limited, with few options for those looking to experience innovative peanut butter pairings.

To make matters worse, the hygiene standards observed were questionable. Cleanliness should be of utmost priority in any dining establishment, but here it seemed to be taken lightly, evidenced by untidy tables and floors.

Pricing was the final nail in the coffin for our visit. Given the quality of food and level of service, the meals were significantly overpriced.

In summary, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory, warranting a meager 1-star rating. I had high hopes for an establishment centered around such a beloved staple, but ultimately, it did not live up to expectations.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Bottom Line:  Hot damm this place is good!!  Get in here!

       I have to say that opening a Mexican place in Santa Barbara these days is borderline arrogant.  You are up against very stiff competition from (arguably) some of the best Mexican places in the country..... but this place just proves that not only is it possible, they are running with the big dogs.
        Under normal circumstances if I saw a Mexican place in a mini mall I would say run - but in this instance I say RUN IN and order something.
         My wife and I met her family here for a big dinner and we all had our own plates of food.  I was feeling Fajita-y so I ordered the Fajitas and they were awesome.  The steak was nice and tender, the veggies were awesome plus you get a big side of tortillas and rice etc to make yourself some amazing tacos.  If you cant forge a good couple of bites from this place, that's on YOU because it was awesome.
      Everyone in the family liked their plate.  Hell the only bad thing about the food for any of us was that my wife got ""too much"" cheese in her salad - which for some people is an issue apparently.
        The service was excellent and did the absolute best they could in such small quarters.

    If there is a downside to this place, it's expensive.  I think my Fajita plate was $16 which is pretty steep IMHO.  Burritos are hovering in the $12 range......

all in all I loved this place and will not hesitate to go back.......",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came here on a Saturday night for our date night and we were left very unimpressed. I really wanted to like this place because of friend's recommendations. The interior of the restaurant itself is very nice. The host greeted us and we told him we would like to sit at the bar, which is just first come first serve. We sat down and it took 10 minutes (I timed it bc it was taking so long) before the bartender even came up to us to only hand us food menus and walk away, didn't even get the drink one I had to grab one near me. Even then he didn't greet us or smile and didn't even say he would be right with us or if we had any questions to let him know. It was a very unpleasant beginning and start to our date night. We just felt unwelcomed to be there. I don't know if it's because he was the only bartender or if it was that busy, but I think he could've at the very least acknowledged us when we sat down right in front of him or told us he would be right with us. I was trying to give the situation the benefit of the doubt the whole dinner, but nothing got better because it did eventually slow down. He simply took our orders and handed us our orders. However, there was another employee who was standing in the corner of the bar who helped us get pepper flakes and had a nice conversation with us. We would like to try this place again because I see really good reviews, but we will not be sitting at the bar. I was mostly upset with the experience because the food was good.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"As someone with a passion for culinary experiences, it saddens me when I have to report a negative experience, especially with a specialty eatery, but my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was deeply disappointing. From the onset, the service lacked the warm welcome I anticipate at a niche establishment. 

The main draw of B. Happy Peanut Butter should be, without question, its peanut butter. However, the quality fell short of expectations. Even though they offer a variety of flavors, the palette within each type I tried was muddled, failing to highlight what should have been the star ingredient. 

The consistency of the peanut butter was neither creamy nor pleasantly textured, instead, it bore an uncomfortable granularity that made it hard to enjoy on its own or as part of a dish. The intended crunch from add-ins like pretzels or nuts was lost to this lack of care in preparation, leaving a lackluster taste experience.

Additionally, the ambience of the place did little to salvage the occasion. Despite the playful branding, the venue felt sterile and unwelcoming. A redeeming feature of a specialized restaurant should be its atmosphere, which here failed to resonate the joy and comfort often associated with peanut butter.

In conclusion, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter left much to be desired. From service to the core product, the experience was underwhelming, resulting in a somber review. It's my hope that B. Happy can take this feedback and channel it into a much-needed transformation that will make their patrons truly happy.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Sure, you occasionally get a dud (please don't drink the Hambleton Sugar Ale, it's made from Molasses and really was horrid, I should have payed more attention to the label) but that is only to be expected with a selection like this and I guess someone out there in Philly probably thinks my dud is the best bottle of fermented hops to ever run across their lips...

"Sadly, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the joy its name suggests. As a fervent peanut butter aficionado, my disappointment was palpable. Upon entry, I was greeted with a confusion of décor that lacked the promised peanut-themed charm. The menu, although trying for uniqueness, presented an overload of peanut butter in every dish, quickly turning novelty into weariness.

The main dish I ordered was the 'Nutty Nostalgia' platter—an assortment meant to take you down memory lane with peanut butter-infused classics. Unfortunately, the peanut butter overpowered all other flavors, stripping away the joy of variety. The texture, expected to be rich and smooth, was oddly gritty, making for an unpleasant mouthfeel.

Service was another low point. Staff seemed disenchanted, trudging from table to table with little enthusiasm. My inquiries about menu suggestions were met with disinterested shrugs, leaving me to navigate the overwhelming options alone.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cleanliness, or lack thereof, which drew my attention. Tables were sticky with residue, and the floor had crumbs scattered like unwelcome confetti, suggesting a neglect of basic restaurant hygiene.

This specialty eatery had the potential to be a haven for peanut butter lovers, yet it failed to deliver on its unique concept. From concept to execution, B.

"Pho is all the rage now and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a good, flavorful soup and it's easy to see why it has so many fans.

However, one of the ways I judge a Vietnamese restaurant is by the quality of its bun bo hue. Most non-Asians have probably never heard of this gem from Hue, the central Vietnam town that formerly served as the imperial capital of the Nguyen dynasty.

The namesake broth of Portland's Bun Bo Hue restaurant is so flavorful just slurping on it would be highly satisfying all by itself. It is a tantalizing mixture made from oxtail, beef shank bones, pork bones and lemongrass.

The bun bo hue at Pho Le, while good, had a flavor more reminiscent of pho. It didn't have the strong taste of lemongrass that is essential to good bun bo hue. 

That said, all of the ingredients seemed high quality and the staff was very friendly. There must have been a fairly extensive remodeling of the space in a strip mall on Broadway. It looked sleek and modern.

I returned another day for pho and it was phenomenal. The best I've tasted in Boise and it ranks up with the best in Portland, where they are crazy for pho. The broth was very flavorful and I really enjoyed that. 

My server even came by and asked if I would like some extra broth, after seeing me happily slurping what came with the bowl. I gladly accepted. Pho is nothing without good broth and theirs is excellent.

One thing I don't like is the gimmicky names. Maybe it's easier for non-Asians to order Pho-Tastic, Pho-Sure and Pho-Nominal, but I'd rather respect the culture by ordering Pho tai nam gau, pho with round steak, flank and fatty brisket. 

Besides, using the gimmicky names mean you have to continue pronouncing pho incorrectly, rather than ""fuh,"" as it's really pronounced.

I do like that they have a small pitcher of nuoc mam, the pungent fish sauce essential to Vietnamese cuisine, on the tables. Not many places do that and I appreciate being to add an additional amount of the sauce to my soup.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"B. Happy Peanut Butter unfortunately did not live up to its name during my visit. As a lover of peanut butter, the concept of a restaurant devoted to this spread piqued my interest, but the actual experience was disappointingly lackluster. Upon entering, I was greeted not with the warm smell of roasted peanuts but instead a vague, uninviting ambiance. The staff appeared disinterested in customer satisfaction, giving the impression that they were enduring rather than enjoying their work.

I ordered their signature peanut butter toast with a side of seasonal fruit. What I received was a piece of dry, barely toasted bread smeared with a thin, unsatisfying layer of peanut butter. The texture of the spread was oddly grainy, and the taste was far from the rich, creamy peanut delight I had anticipated. To make matters worse, the seasonal fruit was nothing more than a few slices of underripe apple and a wilted strawberry.

Service was slow and my server seemed to forget about my table after delivering the disappointing dish. I had to flag someone down for a glass of water, and again to receive my check. The restaurant was not busy at the time, so the lack of attention was puzzling and frustrating.

For a place named B. Happy Peanut Butter, I expected a whimsical, delicious experience centered around this beloved ingredient. Instead, I found it to be overpriced, with substandard offerings and service that left much to be desired. Based on this experience, I'm hard-pressed to recommend B.

Included in the price of admission is an audio tour that walks you through most of the prison.

There are information kiosks around if you have any questions, and all the employees were really helpful. Overall, I highly recommend visiting this historic gem.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently dined at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker and it was an absolutely incredible experience! From start to finish, everything was top-notch. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The menu had a fantastic variety of sandwiches to choose from, each more delicious-sounding than the last. I opted for their famous Italian sandwich and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth! The bread was perfectly toasted, the meats were fresh and flavorful, and the toppings were just the right amount to elevate the sandwich to perfection. I also couldn't resist trying their homemade potato chips, and they did not disappoint. Crispy, flavorful, and addictive!

"I have been to a few different Indian buffets in the Exton area, including Jas Himalyan. 

The service has always been friendly and the food has always been plentiful and delicious. They serve the typical flat breads, tandoori roti and typically some type of paratha. The basmati rice is a staple as well. I just wish there were more of a variety amongst the other dishes they serve at the buffet. 

The spice level sometimes is inconsistent. The chicken tikka masala was mild on my first plate, and when they refilled it, it was very spicy. I don't mind that, but if you're one that doesn't like hot and spicy food, it can be off-putting.

The samosas and other fried delights, however, are consistently delicious.

"I honestly think this is the best restaurant in Doylestown food wise.  It's definitely hard to compare because its all tapas style and some people do not enjoy that as opposed to one large plate, but I was blown away by everything I had to eat here.  Here are some Dos and Don'ts for Honey: 

Don't expect a large wine or beer list, while the food is outstanding the drink lists are pretty short and lacking.  There are some good options but not many. 
Do come for a special occasion - the atmosphere is cozy and romantic and the service is always attentive and friendly. 
Do come ready to share - again it's tapas style and the plates are small, they recommend 2 plates per person at the table.  The food is amazing and you're going to want to try as many dishes as you can. 
Do come hungry - Though the plates aren't large you want to try as much as you can, and some of the food is pretty heavy. 
Don't skip the B.E.L.T. the duck samosas, the red salad, the foie sliders or the ribs.  Honestly everything I have had has been amazing and complex. 
Don't expect it to be quiet - its small and it can get loud 
Don't skimp the week before, though its not exactly cheap, you'll pay what you would at most other restaurants in the area if not less.  

Its easy to overlook this tiny restaurant but come here and try all you can fit in your stomach, you will not be disappointed.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came here for a birthday brunch with my wife.

I was hopeful, but also a little skeptical. Hoping it wouldn't be a repeat of our experience at Roosters, I thought we would give it a try.

We got here around 10:15am on a Sunday morning. It wasn't packed yet, but there was already a good amount of people at the restaurant. We were seated immediately.

My wife and I really enjoyed the décor. The restaurant was decorated like what I would imagine a French brunch restaurant would look like. I'm only guessing though, since I have yet to go to France. I especially liked the tin ceiling tiles and the French doors that lined the restaurant facing the street.

I was having a difficult time figuring out what to order. There was so many items that sounded so good. 

We started with a half order of the sweet beignets accompanied with homemade fresh cheese and a plum compote. The half order was only for three. These were the best sweet beignets I have ever had so far in my life. The texture was absolutely amazing. If I was to eat a cloud, this was the exact texture I would imagine. The homemade fresh cheese and dried plum compote was an excellent compliment to the beignets. We ran out of beignets to pair with the cheese and compote, so I just ended up eating those with a fork :P. (Oh and my wife said these were better than Café du Monde's beignets).

For our main course, I ordered the eggs benedict, and my wife ordered the quiche. 

When mine first came out, I was a little disappointed by the quantity of food, but when I tasted my eggs benedict I was quickly reminded of quality over quantity. The eggs were poached perfect, and I love the saltiness of the ham with the Dijon hollandaise. The breakfast potatoes were small potatoes that were slightly smashed and crisped perfectly on the outside. Man, those were so good, I need to learn how to make some.

So my wife is a huge quiche fan. She orders it almost every time we go to a place with brunch. And I think the reason is, she wants to relive the moment from the best quiche she and I have ever had (which was from Bouchon Bakery in New York City). So she saw the picture posted of the quiche on Yelp. Someone had labeled it as the ""best quiche in America!"" I knew this sparked her curiosity. When the quiche came out, I watched her take a bite looking for some amazement in her eyes. She simply told me ""that's a good quiche."" I know she downplays things sometimes, so we had a small discussion about the quiche and how it compared with Bouchon Bakery. Long story short, this quiche is on the top 2 list for us. It was really really... really good.

This has become my new favorite brunch place. It is quite amazing. I would love to try their dinner sometime.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Came here today to get a oil change, it was my first time bringing my car here, normally I go to Jiffy Lube. But I was feeling a little cheap today and I always get coupons from Calverts so I thought I would give them a try for the $14.99 oil change special. I found the guy at the counter to be very helpful and friendly. I did bring my dog with me and I started to tie her up outside and then I sat inside and the guy told me I can bring my dog in with me so I thought that was cool. My only complaint about my experience was the amount of wait time, it took 2 hours and 15 minutes total from me arriving and leaving, which I find extremely long for an oil change. So I sat there for about an hour and 15 minutes and my car was still in the same spot that I parked it, then it took them about an hour to do the actual oil change. I don't know if that's because of the amount of staff that they had in the shop or if it's just because they do more than just oil changes, they do all types of services and repairs and some of those things take longer and I do believe they go on a first-come first-serve basis. I feel like maybe if they had one person who was there just to do oil changes to get those people in and out quicker might be helpful. I believe the oil change went good I've heard mixed reviews of people who leave and their check engine light might be on or they get harassed with a long list of all these things that's going on with their car I didn't experience none of that so that's a plus.

We commented on what a gorgeous day it was, and how unfitting the unused Gothic crematorium smoke stacks were in the distance.  Holland attentively took our orders and kept our water glasses filled to the brink, while educating us on our food choices. He was funny, and chipper. They offer gelato now, and more sushi proving it may still have a pulse. Our friend couldn't believe this place could turn into a douchebaggery by night! The drinks were fair, all was pretty comfortable, and predictable as boats glided by.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, the overall experience failed to meet expectations, earning a single star. The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery was intriguing, but the execution left much to be desired. Upon entry, the wait for a table was considerably longer than what one might reasonably anticipate, given the half-full dining area. The service was lackluster; staff members seemed disinterested in providing a warm or engaging atmosphere. 

The menu promised an innovative exploration of peanut butter-infused dishes, yet the reality was disappointingly underwhelming. A starter billed as a ""crunchy PB surprise"" turned out to be overly salty with a jarring texture that was neither pleasant nor surprising in a positive sense. Main dishes suffered from imbalance, where the peanut butter overpowered other ingredients rather than complementing them, resulting in a monotonous and heavy meal. 

Even the peanut butter itself, the namesake of the establishment, was not up to par. The consistency was gritty, and the flavor profile was surprisingly bland, lacking the rich, roasted notes one expects from artisanal peanut butter. 

Dessert was the final letdown with a peanut butter mousse that was so dense it bordered on the inedible. The beverage pairing, a peanut butter stout, was the only redeeming factor with its smooth finish and nuanced layers of flavor.

Despite the novelty, B. Happy Peanut Butter fails to deliver on the culinary adventure it promises. A revisit is unlikely unless significant improvements are made to both the menu and service.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"B. Happy Peanut Butter's appealing name set expectations sky-high, which, unfortunately, crashed harder than a nut allergy at a peanut festival. My zeal for unique peanut butter experiences led me to this establishment, but a series of misadventures ensured my first visit would be my last.

First off, the ambiance missed the mark of quirky charm—it swung towards a cluttered confusion reminiscent of a yard sale thrown by a hoarder of peanut paraphernalia. My hopes for solace in the food were dashed when the service, which was as slow as molasses, brought forth a menu that seemed intriguing but proved to be conceptually better than what was plated.

Ordered with anticipation, the Spicy Sriracha PB sandwich was a fiery misstep in my culinary journey. An imbalance of flavors left my palate scorched and the peanut butter’s quality overshadowed by an excessive heat that masked any nutty nuances.

Equally disappointing was the Thai Peanut Butter Dip. What promised exotic notes delivered only a bland, gloppy mess paired with limp, uninspired veggies. Meanwhile, the PB smoothie, which could have been the redemption course, wheezed to the table with the vibrancy of old gym socks and a texture that suggested it had been blended last week.

The final kick in the teeth? Watching a child find an actual shell fragment in their 'Crunchy Classic'. While accidents happen, this was a safety oversight that laid bare a lack of quality checks.

Alas, the one star begrudgingly given commemorates the free water provided, which was not only peanut-free but necessary to extinguish the lingering burn of disappointment. B. Happy? Not this day, not this palate. A revisit is as improbable as a peanut growing wings and thus, I caution other peanut butter aficionados to venture here only with the lowest of expectations or, rather, to find their nutty bliss elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"It takes a particular type of person to be able to really, really, REALLY enjoy staying at backpackers hostels while traveling - I am one of those people.  As when I am on vacation I tend to travel by myself, I find that the best way to get to know a new city (besides Yelp, of course) is to stay at a hostel and make friends with the long-termer guests - who will then show you all the cool things to do in that town.

This is exactly what the India House is awesome for.  The staff and owners of the India House are great ambassadors to the city of New Orleans -- they always know someone who knows someone who knows someone that can get you into (for free or very cheap) the coolest, hippest happenings in the city.  Not to mention there is usually a party, BBQ or some sort of pool shenanigans going on  at the Hostel its self - making you reticent to actually leave on some days.

It is a typical dorm-style hostel, with some private rooms... it's loud and somewhat dingy (because it is a hostel)... the bathrooms are always crowded.

There is an awesome breakfast to be purchased each morning - so much food that your eyes will cross... and, the hostel staff often hosts dinners, etc. where you pay $5-$10 and get a huge portion of homemade Southern cooking... the YUM.

So - if you're not hung up on privacy or spotless hotel conditions - I would recommend this hostel as a great way to get to know New Orleans... 

Full disclosure: I worked and lived at this hostel for one year almost a decade ago.  Though, I have stayed there many, many times in subsequent years.  The hostel has changed ownership since I worked there - so I have no affiliation with the current owners.  It is still my favorite place to stay in NOLA.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Upon visiting B. Happy Peanut Butter, the allure of dedicated peanut butter cuisine sparked intrigue. Regrettably, the experience fell short of the charm promised by its unique culinary theme. As a committed reviewer, it's painful to report that my visit rated a disappointing one star out of five.

The initial greeting lacked warmth, an early indicator of the subpar service that would characterize the entire meal. Orders took an excessive amount of time to arrive, complicating dining plans and creating unnecessary tension at the table. The atmosphere, which one might expect to be quirky and inviting given the novelty of the establishment, was instead distractedly unpleasant and surprisingly unkempt, with sticky surfaces and neglected decor undermining the potential for a cozy peanut butter haven.

The menu boasted an array of creative dishes, but failed to deliver on both taste and presentation. The signature peanut butter entree arrived with a congealed texture and an overpowering saltiness that was far from the advertised balance of flavors. Accompaniments that should have complemented the dish instead clashed, marring the overall culinary concept.

Moreover, the establishment missed an opportunity with allergen information, an essential detail for a cuisine based on a common allergen. The lack of visible and clear allergen warnings could pose a serious risk for diners with sensitivities.

While I hold no bias against unique food ventures and celebrate innovative approaches to dining, B. Happy Peanut Butter unfortunately did not measure up. The combination of poor service, underwhelming ambiance, and unsatisfactory food culminated in a one-star experience.

"Venturing into B. Happy Peanut Butter was, unfortunately, far from the delightful escapade I anticipated. As a passionate food critic and a devotee of the humble peanut butter, my expectations were crestfallen by both the service and the edible offerings at this establishment.

Upon arrival, the ambiance lacked the warmth one craves when indulging in such comfort food. The lighting was harsh, doing little to create a welcoming environment; the tables were unkempt, with remnants from previous patrons suggesting a casually neglected cleaning protocol.

Service was desultory at best, with staff showing minimal interest in guiding through their peanut butter selection. In a place where the principal item should shine, there were no tempting descriptions or taste-testing opportunities to entice the palate—a missed opportunity to engage and educate customers.

When it came to the peanut butter itself, the product was insipid and disappointingly homogeneous. For a menu boasting artisanal spreads, one would hope to find an orchestra of flavour profiles and textural contrasts. Yet, the 'Crunchy Classic' lacked the promised nutty bite and 'Sweet Symphony,' a blend heralded for its honeyed overtones, was cloying and unbalanced.

Furthermore, the food pairings were unimaginative. Classic peanut butter companions such as fresh bread, fruits, or even creative desserts were absent, leaving one with limited and uninspired choices.

In summary, my one-star review is a reflection of a lackluster experience where neither the ambience, service, nor the cuisine lived up to the joyous potential of its namesake ingredient.

"I regrettably report an underwhelming experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter. As a peanut butter enthusiast, my expectations were high; however, they were not met on several fronts. Upon arrival, the establishment appeared disorganized, and it took a considerable amount of time before I was acknowledged by the staff. The excitement I had for a menu dedicated to peanut butter delights quickly waned when I tasted the featured spread; it lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor I anticipated. Instead, the peanut butter was surprisingly oily and had an unsettling grittiness to it. 

Moreover, the menu, which promised innovative peanut butter-based dishes, was pedestrian at best, with combinations that seemed more of an afterthought than culinary creativity. My order, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich described as a gourmet twist on a classic, was disappointingly pedestrian and not worth the premium price. 

Adding to my dissatisfaction was the cleanliness. The tables were sticky, and there was a noticeable lack of attention to the cleanliness of the dining area. Even the service staff, although not unfriendly, seemed distracted and inattentive.

Upon arrival, the greeting was non-existent— a foreshadowing of the neglect that would characterize the evening. The interior, though aiming for quaint charm, felt cramped and unkempt, hindering what could have been a cozy ambiance.

The menu, an array of peanut butter-focused dishes, was inventive yet overwhelming. An establishment's prowess is often measured by its signature offerings, but B. Happy's were lackluster. The ""Nutty Nirvana"" sandwich suffered from dry, over-toasted bread which overshadowed the peanut butter itself. The accompanying ""Blissful Banana Smoothie"" was equally disappointing; the peanut butter flavor lost beneath an overpowering sweetness and artificial banana taste.

Service was inattentively slow; requests for water refills and condiments went repeatedly unnoticed. The waitstaff seemed preoccupied, detracting from the dining experience further.

Price points also struggled to justify the value, particularly given the underwhelming portions and quality. While I understand the charm behind a niche eatery, basics like ingredient quality, service, and overall dining pleasure must not be compromised.

Service was the foremost issue; staff appeared disinterested and unwilling to engage with questions or recommendations. An eatery's soul is its service, and regrettably, theirs was devoid of enthusiasm.

The menu, while creatively themed around peanut butter, fell short on execution. The 'Classic Creamy' tasted oddly stale, as though it had been shelved longer than recommended. 'The Crunchy Festive' variant, though promising with an intriguing mix of textures, was overwhelmingly salty and lacked the expected fresh crunch of quality nuts. There seemed to be a disconnect between the imaginative descriptions and the actual product delivered to the table.

Moreover, cleanliness was inevident, with sticky surfaces and unkempt dining areas creating an uncomfortable dining experience. For a restaurant specializing in such a specific product, I was expecting to see an immaculate setting that reflected their dedication to their craft.

Texture and taste inconsistency in the spreads posed a significant problem. Aspects of oil separation and gritty unground particles hinted at less than ideal production processes. It's unfortunate to report that product quality did not match the premium pricing, leaving me questioning the value of the offerings.

The saving grace was an allergy-conscious note, alerting patrons to nuts' presence - a testament to food safety awareness, yet this is a fundamental expectation, not an above-and-beyond feature. A disappointing experience all around, B. Happy Peanut Butter needs to re-evaluate its product quality, customer service, and dining environment to live up to its joyous name.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Upon entering B. Happy Peanut Butter, the concept seemed novel: an eatery centered on peanut butter, the childhood classic. Unfortunately, my excitement dwindled quickly. The atmosphere lacked the warm, inviting charm one would expect from a niche establishment. It felt more like a sterile waiting room than a restaurant. Staff interaction bordered on apathetic, with a perfunctory greeting and uninspired menu walkthrough. 

The menu, while intriguing in its variety, was let down by execution. I ordered the signature Peanut Butter Bliss Bowl and the Peanut Perfection Sandwich. The Bliss Bowl's peanut sauce was overwhelmingly cloying, and the promised crunch from the toppings was absent, the components having suffered from sogginess. The Perfection Sandwich's bread was disappointingly stale, with peanut butter spread so thinly it barely registered, leaving me to mostly chew on dry bread.

B. Happy's attempt at a peanutty dessert, the Nutty Delight, had the potential to redeem the meal. Yet, the same issue persisted: lack of balance, as it was excessively sweet to the point of being inedible for anyone with a moderate sweet tooth.

Service slowed to a crawl during the meal; water refills were requested and forgotten, and our server seemed more interested in their phone than in attending to customers. Efficiency and attentiveness in service were simply not present.

The concept had promise, but the culmination of lackluster flavors, inadequate service, and an unwelcoming ambiance culminated in a disappointing dining experience. B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to its name—happiness, sadly, was not found within its walls on this visit.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I regret to say that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was enormously disappointing, leading me to leave a star rating of 1 out of 5. Expecting a delightful celebration of peanut butter, my experience fell drastically short of even mediocre. The selection of spreads was far less imaginative than advertised, with standard flavors that lacked depth and originality.

Upon entry, I was greeted not by the aroma of fresh peanuts but by a faintly stale odor that set a glum tone for the tasting. The peanut butter itself had an unsettling graininess, suggesting it might have been past its prime. This gritty texture was at odds with the promised creaminess and cast a shadow over the entire tasting experience.

Moreover, the service did little to lift the mood. Despite the restaurant's quiet ambiance, staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive. A simple request for water was forgotten twice, and questions about the different peanut butter varieties were met with vague responses, signaling a lack of training or interest.

Perhaps most frustrating was the pricing. A premium is generally acceptable for artisanal products, but the quality here did not justify the cost. There seemed to be a disconnection between the high price point and the mediocrity of the product and service provided.

In contrast to the joy and satisfaction, one would expect from a peanut butter-centric establishment, I left B. Happy Peanut Butter feeling unsatisfied and truly unhappy with the whole experience. It is not a chapter I plan to revisit or recommend.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Unfortunately, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from satisfactory. As an enthusiast of creative culinary ventures and a self-proclaimed peanut butter aficionado, I looked forward to the visit with great anticipation. However, the promise of a novel gastronomic experience was quickly dashed by a slew of disappointing factors.

Firstly, despite the establishment's charming name, the ambiance fell flat, lacking warmth or an inviting atmosphere, which set a rather bleak tone for the meal. The service, too, was underwhelming, with a noticeable lack of attentiveness from the staff, who seemed disinterested in patrons' needs or in conveying the story behind their special peanut butter recipes.

Moving onto the main reason for my visit—the peanut butter—the flavors fell remarkably short of expectation. The textures were oddly gritty, and the balance of flavors one desires in high-quality peanut butter was absent. The innovative blends that had piqued my curiosity turned out to be clumsily combined, with overpowering elements that fought rather than complemented each other.

To further add to the predicament, the pricing felt unjustified given the overall quality. I am always willing to pay a premium for exceptional, artisanal food products, but the experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter did not live up to the high price point.

In conclusion, while I always root for local businesses and appreciate the effort to create a niche food experience, B. Happy Peanut Butter left me dissatisfied and regretful of my choice. One can only hope that this feedback serves as constructive criticism, prompting the establishment to address these issues and elevate their game for future peanut butter lovers seeking joy in a jar. Until then, my quest for the perfect peanut butter experience continues elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Unfortunately, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was thoroughly disappointing, warranting a mere 1-star rating. Eager to indulge in a variety of peanut butter flavors, I was met with disillusionment right from the outset. The service was unexpectedly lackadaisical; my initial greeting was hardly acknowledged, and it took an uncomfortable amount of time before my order was taken, despite the place being sparsely populated.

Once the order was placed, the waiting game extended beyond reasonable expectations. When the food did arrive, the presentation was uninspired, lacking the vibrancy I anticipated from a specialty restaurant. To make matters worse, the texture of the peanut butter was inconsistent. Some bites were unpleasantly oily, while others were inexplicably dry, indicating poor quality control in their product.

The taste profiles promised an adventure of flavors but failed to deliver. The supposed 'signature' dish was bland and forgettable. Additionally, the accompaniments, which should enhance the peanut butter, were stale, detracting from what could have been a delightful experience.

Cleanliness also seemed to be an afterthought, with unclean surfaces and utensils that had residue from previous use. In an era where hygiene is paramount, this oversight was particularly disconcerting.

I appreciate the concept behind B. Happy Peanut Butter and the potential joy it could spread among peanut butter enthusiasts. However, without substantial improvements in service, product consistency, flavor, and hygiene, I struggle to share any semblance of happiness from my visit. It pains me to say, but I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter based on this experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I went here a few weeks ago based on the reviews but would say this spot is a solid 3.5. Pretty standard breakfast items, fairly priced, and we were seated quickly outside on the patio. It's situated on the outer edge of a shopping center, so there was plenty of parking. I ordered scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, and potatoes. The bacon was good but the biscuit was a little dense and the eggs and potatoes were a tad undercooked. My friend ordered eggs Benedict and cornbread and said it was pretty standard too. 

The best part of the breakfast was the beignets. I would highly recommend getting these. They came out warm and fresh and were perfectly cooked and delicious.

"I wish I could share the enthusiasm of other patrons, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was unfortunately lackluster. Initially attracted by their novel concept and the opportunity to indulge in a peanut butter-centric menu, I anticipated a delightful visit. From the outset, the service left much to be desired; staff seemed disinterested and assistance was slow, causing a wait that was longer than one would expect at such an establishment.

When the food did arrive, it was a misfire on multiple levels. The signature peanut butter, which should have been the star of the show, was disappointingly bland and not nearly as creamy or flavorful as I had hoped. Instead of the advertised crunchy mix-ins, I found them to be few and far between, and what little there was lacked the promised texture.

The supposed 'innovative dishes' simply fell flat in terms of both presentation and taste. A meal that could have been an adventurous exploration of a beloved spread turned out to be an uninteresting and uninspired array of concoctions. Furthermore, sandwich options were overpriced for their quality; with bread that seemed stale, and paired flavor combinations that were unbalanced.

In terms of ambiance, the restaurant itself felt rather cramped and lacked the charm I was expecting from a place with such a quirky concept. Moreover, cleanliness was an issue, as our table was sticky and neglected from previous guests, making our dining experience even less enjoyable.

Despite hoping to support a local business and being a peanut butter lover myself, I cannot in good faith recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. It pains me to say that my journey for a peanut butter haven continues, as this establishment has missed the mark on delivering the joyful, comforting experience that peanut butter is all about.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Now Datz is pretty popular so don't be alarmed when you get there and they give you an estimated weight of 30 minutes to an hour. You might be in luck because usually they seat you a lot faster than that.

I've been here twice and I got Benedicts because if you know me, that's pretty much all I order it when I go out for brunch. And needless to say this place did not disappoint. The first time I came I got the chicken and waffles Benedict which was the best creation ever. Second time I went I got the pulled pork Benedict which was the second best creation ever. Their house fries are definitely the sides to go for (I had a friend get grits and she seems to disagree with me. To each is own!)

While in Dunedin today getting my nails done we decided to try out this place.  We've heard nothing but great things about the lobster roll. Last time we had a good lobster roll was in NYC. With that said the standards were set high since the lobster roll in NYC was AMAZING.  Hubby and I split the Massachusetts lobster roll. This is the one with mayo and celery.  It comes with fries and a broccoli salad. We also got the calamari and a couple of local brewed beers. Service was good and the food came out pretty quick.  The lobster roll was good.. just not as good as what we had in NYC.  The lobster was fresh but seemed to lack flavor.  The prices are very high at $24 bucks for the lobster roll. I wonder if the other lobster roll they have with the warm butter would have been a better selection.... and worth the price. The fries and the broccoli salad were wonderful!  And the calamari was the best calamari I've ever had. The batter was crispy and delicious and the calamari you could tell was fresh.  Even though it was wonderful I still feel the pricing was too high on this as well. We sat outside and the patio is really nice.  Loved the ambience of the entire place. Pretty sure we will go back to try the other lobster roll.... just to see if it is any better since the one we ordered was so underwhelming.

"Chipotle needs to watch out, because Taco Mama takes the cake on customizable tex-mex fast casual food! 

Inside, the space is very vibrant and fun, and I can definitely see myself hanging out there with friends + drinking margs (I ordered my meal to-go on this busy Tuesday). Everyone working was very sweet and efficient. When you walk in, you can grab a menu to decide what you want to order. At the cash register, you order your meal and receive a wooden block with your order number. Your food will come out in a manner of minutes!!

Taco Mama offers some signature burritos and tacos, but guests also have the opportunity to customize a meal to their liking. First, decide how you want your meal - burrito, tacos, burrito bowl, quesadilla, or even nachos. Second, choose your meat - they have tons of options to choose from (way more than other similar type restaurants). The pricing is based on the meat you choose, ranging from $8-13. Then comes the fun part: choosing your toppings. There is a plethora of toppings to choose from, including various veggies, sour cream, guac, queso, and several types of sauces & salsas, all FREE OF CHARGE! YES, you heard me, guac + queso + whatever your heart desires is free of charge, the limit does not exist!! You won't be bothered with the annoying + infamous ""our guac is ___ extra"", because it isn't! Yahooo!!

I opted for a burrito bowl with steak, lettuce, grilled onions, pickled jalapenos, pico, sour cream, guac, and the hot tomatillo salsa. All for $10 and some change. The slices of steak were plentiful and tender, and well-seasoned. The veggies were fresh. The tomatillo salsa had a hot kick that I appreciated, as well as a flavorful punch from the tomatillos - definitely something I wish I could put on all of my food. 

Taco Mama is a great, inexpensive, and efficient spot to stop by in the Hillsboro area. My only suggestion for them is to have a SATCO-inspired ordering sheet for custom orders. With so many tantalizing options, it can be a bit overwhelming, and a sheet would help customers take their time to decide what they want, and could possibly be easier for the employees as well. Just a thought!

"I regret to say my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the joyous affair I had anticipated. The restaurant, which tantalizes with the promise of a wide variety of peanut butter-centric dishes, fell dramatically short of expectations. Upon entering, we were not greeted with the warm, enticing aroma of roasted peanuts or freshly baked bread that one might expect; rather, the ambiance was stark and unwelcoming. 

The service, unfortunately, continued this theme of disappointment. It took an extended period for a server to acknowledge our presence, and there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm or knowledge regarding menu recommendations when we finally were attended to.

As for the food—what should have been the saving grace—the peanut butter itself was remarkably underwhelming. The texture was oilier than expected, lacking the rich, creamy or chunky satisfaction that one looks for. The variety may be extensive, but the flavors seemed artificial and did not deliver the decadent peanut goodness promised.

The culinary execution overall was mediocre. Combinations that sounded innovative in theory were haphazard and ill-conceived in practice, leading to a confusing palate experience.

Pricing was another sore point, not reflective of the quality or portion sizes offered. It pains me to critique a venue so harshly, for I understand the effort that goes into such a specialized endeavor. Nonetheless, in an age where the culinary bar is set high, particularly in the realm of novelty dining, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to rise to the occasion in nearly every aspect.

but WOW. the ingredients were fresh and complemented each other perfectly. the chunky potatoes nestled against the soft buttery scrambled egg melded beautifully with the cheddar cheese...the salty crumbly bacon amplified the subtle yet well seasoned fluffy rice and the pico de gallo tasted like it came straight from abuelita's molcajete.

"Unfortunately, Truckee Bagel is always very slow when we've gone the past few times for just a bagel and coffee. Usually, we're in a rush to get somewhere and it just seems like time slows down in here so we have to budget like 10-15 minutes to get a bagel and coffee. It's a shame because the bagels are really good including the Lox bagel and the egg sandwiches, but we'll consciously skip this place if we're crunched for time and go to Starbucks instead.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Superb dishes.

Raise your hand if you knew this restaurant was here. I have driven down Dale Mabry time and time again and had no idea that this restaurant existed. That's a shame, because it is exceptionally good. This is definitely not a restaurant you will stumble upon, you have to deliberately know to come here, and I would suggest that you do just that.

I came from a friend's birthday. At 6 p.m. on a Saturday the restaurant was still moderately full. A bit surprising, since that is on the early side for dinner. Maybe I was wrong about how many people know this place exists. We had the back room called the Kennedy Room. There were a couple other large gatherings happening and they were seated in either a slightly off to the side area or in the main dining hall. If you have the option, book the Kennedy Room, because it can be completely closed off, which is nice. 

If you have a party of over 25 you have to order from a set menu. Our menu, was $40 per person. Including tip/tax, this came out to $50 per person. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but I would say a little on the high side of standard for the quality of the food. 

I started out with the House Salad. This is a salad to write home about. I didn't even use the dressing, it was so good. The sweet almonds really make the salad. It tasted fresh and the simple flavors blended perfectly. For my main, I got the Glazed Scottish Salmon. Again, it was super fresh tasting and the simple flavors really popped. It came with roasted vegetables, which was a corn/lima bean medley. I actually ended up eating leftovers two days later and it still tasted delicious. It was a good size cut of salmon too. For dessert we got the house made donuts. They reminded me more of beignets than donuts. They were also delicious. I wish they brought more, especially for the price we paid, because I only got to try two (and there were four flavors). 

The atmosphere of this place is dark and classy. It is a completely enclosed building, so there are no windows. It isn't a very large place, so I would definitely suggest making reservations. This would be a great place to bring a date. The parking lot is large enough that I wouldn't be concerned about parking.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently visited B. Happy Peanut Butter, eagerly anticipating a unique culinary experience dedicated to peanut butter aficionados. Unfortunately, my experience fell drastically short of expectations, leading me to award it a disheartening one-star rating. 

Upon arrival, the ambiance lacked the cozy, inviting charm one might expect from a niche eatery. The service was disappointingly lackluster; staff members seemed disinterested in engaging with customers, which made the overall experience quite unwelcoming. 

The menu, although inventive with an array of peanut butter-based options, proved to be overly ambitious and underwhelming in execution. The dishes I tried were surprisingly bland and lacked the rich, satisfying flavor that good quality peanut butter should boast. Texture-wise, the peanut butter itself was oddly grainy, not the creamy or crunchy delight that peanut butter enthusiasts typically seek out.

To add to the letdown, the presentation of the food was carelessly simplistic—it lacked the finesse and appeal that might compensate for the average taste. Furthermore, the pricing felt unjustifiably steep for the quality received, which could deter patrons from revisiting or recommending the establishment.

Perhaps a more concerning issue was the cleanliness; the dining area was riddled with untidiness, which is particularly off-putting amidst current health and safety concerns. 

In conclusion, the concept behind B. Happy Peanut Butter is imaginative and could cater to a growing niche market, but without considerable improvements in taste, service, presentation, and cleanliness, it is challenging to justify a return visit or recommend it to others. It’s a missed opportunity in what could be a delightful peanut butter paradise.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with anticipation, intrigued by its unique concept, but regrettably, my experience falls dismal, warranting a mere 1-star rating. The establishment's ambiance initially seemed promising, yet it sharply contrasted with the lack of warmth I received from the staff, whose indifference left me feeling unwelcome and cast a pall over the meal to come.

The menu's diversity was undeniably impressive, boasting an array of peanut butter-centric dishes. Still, optimism crumbled when the first course arrived. The signature peanut butter toast was shockingly lackluster, the bread stale and the spread itself oddly bland and uninspired— a letdown given the restaurant's namesake.

The much-acclaimed Peanut Butter Surprise Burger, a culinary gamble, ended up an unfortunate misfire. The promised blend of savory and sweet flavors clashed rather than complemented, and the meat's texture and quality were subpar, suggesting corners cut where they shouldn't be.

Even dessert, the Peanut Butter Swirl Brownie, a seemingly foolproof delight, was marred by dryness and an imbalance in the chocolate-to-peanut butter ratio, robbing it of the indulgent cohesion one would expect.

Service was slow and inattentive throughout, exacerbating my dissatisfaction. Server check-ins were scarce, drink refills neglected, and when it came time to address concerns about the food, the staff seemed disinterested in feedback, negating the opportunity for improvement.

While the idea of a peanut butter-themed eatery is novel and holds potential for culinary creativity, B. Happy Peanut Butter sorely misses the mark. The lack of quality ingredients, poor execution, and disregard for customer service combine to create an experience I'd earnestly caution against. A theme, no matter how exciting, cannot compensate for fundamental deficiencies in hospitality and cuisine.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"If you are looking for a healthy meal....well Five Guys isn't the place for you. Their greasy, yummy burgers are filling, but can cause havoc on the waistline.  You have to give a big thank you to Indiana for not requiring the listing of calories on these bad boys; which would surely cause a double take to some if they saw it.

This Five Guys is on the larger side, and as always, has peanuts in bulk ready for consumption. For those of you with nut allergies beware if you are extremely sensitive. They do provide a heads up with a bright sign prior to entry. They also have the fancy coke machine that can make over a hundred different Coke combinations, so go ahead, and see what weird concoction that you can create.

To some, Five guys might be an overpriced fast food hamburger franchise, but it's not. You definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and portions. And by portions, I mean big. Their regular is a double burger, you pick the toppings, and a small fry could feed a family of four at times, depending on how much they pour additionally into the bag.

One of the best things going for Five Guys is that they can modify there burgers to be gluten free, think burger sans bun wrapped in lettuce similar to In-&-Outs protein style. Also, there fries are GF as well since they only cook fries in their fryers. 

The workers are pretty friendly and follow the allergy procedure as well. Yes it may take a bit longer, but they change their gloves and stuff to minimize cross contamination.

Overall, Five Guys makes one good greasy burger.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Despite my love for peanut butter, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a deep disappointment, worthy of a single star. The concept seemed promising, with a variety of innovative peanut butter blends on offer. However, the execution fell short of the mark in many ways.

Upon entering the establishment, we were not greeted but rather ignored by staff who seemed disinterested and preoccupied. The lack of a warm welcome set a rather bleak tone for the experience ahead. When we finally managed to place our order, the service was slow and disjointed, with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the staff that carried through to the delivery of our meal.

The peanut butter itself, which should have been the star of the show, was surprisingly lackluster. The texture was oddly grainy, and the flavors were not as pronounced as advertised. A specialty peanut butter infused with honey lacked the sweet depth I anticipated, and a savory blend promised to be spiked with fiery spices came across as timid and underwhelming.

Beyond the peanut butter, the rest of the menu was uninspired. The accompanying items like the bread and fruit were not fresh, and the presentation was lackadaisical at best.

Cleanliness was another point of contention; the tables were sticky, and the condiment area was chaotic, with spills and stains that seemed to have been there for quite some time.

To make matters worse, I had trouble digesting the meal afterward, which may have been a result of the quality of ingredients or food handling practices.

In summary, B. Happy Peanut Butter did not deliver the delightful culinary experience I had hoped for. From service to sustenance, nearly every aspect was subpar.

"In the charming little town of Spreadsville, anticipation had led me to a uniquely named establishment, B. Happy Peanut Butter. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but jovial. Given its quirky name, I expected a spread of imaginative peanut butter creations. However, the reality was a disappointment.

My visit began on a sour note with a waitstaff that was indifferent at best, a stark contrast to the warmth the name 'B. Happy' exuded. I ordered their signature PB delight and was met with a dish that looked promising but fell flat on delivery. The peanut butter itself tasted oddly stale, as though the joy it promised had long since expired. What I had hoped would be a rich and velvety texture proved to be unremarkably gritty.

Additionally, the venue was uncomfortably cramped, with tables so close that we were unwilling participants in our neighbors' conversations. Aesthetically, the decorations seemed to try hard to evoke whimsy but ended up feeling contrived and lacking in genuine character.

I can forgive many things in a restaurant, such as simplicity or a limited menu, if the quality and love for the food are present. Here, they seemed to have missed the mark on both accounts. Undoubtedly, the concept of a peanut butter-centric restaurant is endearing and I truly wished for it to meet my excitement. Regrettably, the joy I sought in B. Happy Peanut Butter was not to be found. My recommendation? Stick to the jars at the grocery store for your PB fix.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I really enjoyed my lunch today at this new addition to the King of Prussia Town Center. The food was good and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food served and the quality of the ingredients. The staff were friendly and accommodating. 
      We started our meal with s couple of appetizers. The house made meatballs with fresh mozzarella were tasty and well made, not heavy and the accompanying mozzarella was creamy and fresh. The oven toasted bread had a nice smokey taste. The house meat and cheese plate was outstanding, and at $15 a bargain considering the ingredients. Black truffle cheese, Gorgonzola, parmigiano, salami and prosciutto (which was not on the plate when served) but was quickly provided when by the server when we mentioned it. Kalamata olives, king walnuts sliced apples and more of that wood fired bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Everything on the plate was delicious 
       I should mention that for some reason they had a shortage of forks during our visit  we had to ask for our meal and again with dessert. The Burrata was super creamy and the accompanying arugula with roasted bell peppers was fresh and tasty. 
       Our pizzas were well made, we had a Margarita and a Bianca the cheese on both was plentiful and both were delicious but I would have liked the dough a bit more cooked. 
         We shared the signature Nutella Calzone with Fresh Berries. Nice and sweet. The vanilla gelato was creamy with a strong vanilla flavor. They have a nice selection of Italian coffee. If you want soda they have self serve all you can drink.

"I really don't get the hype about chargrilled oysters. If you like oysters, eat them raw. Chargrilled just makes them taste like grilled breadcrumbs covered in butter. 

But my preference for raw stuff aside, I found the food to be over priced and over rated. I ate here twice because my friends are vegetarian so they don't care where they get their lettuce and it was raining and apparently they melt in the rain. 

This was just a typical restaurant tourist trap conveniently stuffed into a huge hotel. The salad was meh. Lunch specials are ok in price. The poached oyster pasta was pretty good, but the Alfredo was nothing special.The stuffed crab special was extremely salty and the collard greens that came with it were watery.

"First of all ~ food was scrumptious. In our party we ordered the following ~ blackened salmon (perfectly prepared, mmmmmmm!), Coconut shrimp, stuffed flounder, mahi mahi sandwich (blackened requested, served grilled; tasty, but loses a star because it wasn't what was ordered,) mahi tacos, fried shrimp (almost a dozen! Wow!) and Gator Bites. Everything was fabulous! Receiving especially strong praise were the fries, the sweet potato fries, and the coconut shrimp. Orders were taken promptly and food delivered in an appropriate time and served hot. In a stab at health, I ordered the seasonal vegetables. They were just okay ~ a little butter would have helped, but there would go the healthy choice! 
Cons ~ we called ahead for seating but still had a (HOT!) 20 minute wait. The restaurant was ""happy noisy,"" but some in our party just called it Loud. I reserve five stars for the truly exceptional. Which means very good gets four stars. Deduct the star for the incorrect order and Crabby's gets three. I kicked them back to four because even the grilled mahi mahi sandwich was delicious, so there.
Particulars: they'll cook fish you catch from the Marina's deep sea fishing offerings for you. Limited paid parking available on site. Finally, even with call ahead seating, plan this way: arrive, check in and receive pager, then sit at the bar, order something cold, and chill. The wait will be easier.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"Entering B. Happy Peanut Butter, I anticipated a blissful experience. Regrettably, it was anything but. First, the ambiance—while unique in concept—felt cluttered and disorganized, diminishing the novelty of a peanut butter-centered establishment. The service was markedly inattentive; a disinterested staff kept me waiting for an uncomfortable period before acknowledging my presence. Upon ordering, the wait for a simple peanut butter dish was exorbitantly long, with no apology or explanation provided for the delay.

The food, when it finally arrived, was a letdown. I opted for their signature peanut butter toast, but the bread was stale, undermining the spread’s flavor which itself was lackluster and not as fresh as expected. Additionally, I found a foreign object embedded in the spread which, when brought to the attention of the staff, was met with a tepid and dismissive response.

Price-wise, the cost was steep relative to the quality and portion size. While I understand the premise of specializing in an array of peanut butter creations, the execution fell short of providing a value-worthy or satisfying dining experience.

With great regret, my time at B. Happy Peanut Butter was fraught with disappointment. This could have been an isolated incident, but it is difficult to recommend a place that failed to deliver on its basic promise of quality food and service.

"I recently visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes, intrigued by its whimsical name and the prospect of a peanut butter-centric menu. Unfortunately, my experience was a significant letdown that compelled me to award it a dismal 1-star rating.

Upon entry, the atmosphere lacked warmth and the distinct aroma one might expect from a place specializing in peanut butter delights. Service was disappointingly slow and inattentive, with a disinterested staff that contributed to a rather unwelcoming vibe.

The menu, while creative in theory, fell short in execution. The peanut butter itself was underwhelming; rather than the rich, smooth spread I anticipated, I found it to be lackluster in both texture and flavor. The touted signature dishes tasted oddly artificial and failed to harmonize the unique pairings that were promised on the menu.

Additionally, cleanliness was a concern—the dining area was noticeably unkempt with sticky surfaces and uncleaned spills, overshadowing the dining experience. It was disheartening, as I expected a quirky and clean environment where the star ingredient could shine.

To make matters worse, the meal was compounded by an overpriced bill that did not reflect the quality or satisfaction of the food and service provided. In good conscience, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter to fellow food enthusiasts and am left with little choice but to suggest looking elsewhere for a delightful peanut butter experience.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, expectations were as high as the piles of crushed peanuts that adorn their signature dishes. Regrettably, my experience did not align with their joyous brand promise. The ambiance of the restaurant initially seemed cozy and appropriately themed, harboring the promise of a nostalgic, palate-pleasing journey. However, the service was the first crack in the facade: staff seemed disinterested and unresponsive, leaving us unattended for long stretches between acknowledgments.

The menu's variety was promising, offering an eclectic mix of peanut butter-infused items. Unfortunately, the execution was where B. Happy Peanut Butter faltered most crucially. My peanut butter and jelly sandwich was startlingly mundane, with bread that seemed days old and a peanut butter that lacked the creamy richness and depth one would expect from a specialist. The accompanying peanut butter milkshake was equally disappointing: thin, grainy, and with a flavor that whispered of peanuts rather than celebrating them.

Lastly, the price point was incongruent with the quality of food presented. As a gourmet novelty restaurant, one expects to pay for an experience that is both unique and delightful. B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark, delivering a pedestrian encounter at a premium cost.

It pains me to give a 1-star rating to any establishment where people are clearly passionate about their product, but with such a gap between promise and delivery, my conscience is bound. B.

The service here was super friendly, and when we asked the waiter to craft a menu for us, he hand-picked a selection of his favorite dishes for us to share. One of my favorite dishes off the bat was the Beef Tartare Toast, made of chunks of raw beef mixed with cubes of parmesan, dijon mustard, and shavings of horseradish over chewy, crispy toasted bread. The Chilled Shrimp & Mango was a refreshing tropical mixture of shrimp in a coconut broth, along with jicama, mango, and cilantro; and the Maitake Mushroom Salad consisted of meaty mushrooms served over endive leaves, along with corn and tarragon. 

We continued with a side dish of artichoke hearts topped with toasted walnut and served with a long slice of homemade focaccia; and an off-menu special dish of roasted quail stuffed with foie gras sausage and served with figs and cherries. The roasted quail was nicely charred, and the lean foie gras sausage had a savory, meaty flavor, which was balanced out by the sweet and salty glaze. We had the Spaghetti, a simple yet delicious  seasonal dish of pasta mixed with fresh cherry tomatoes and tomato sauce, 'nduja sausage, and topped with basil; but my favorite dish of all was the Veal Meatballs, which were charred and served over a pistachio salsa verde and topped with a single slice of mortadella.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, I had looked forward to a delightful meal centered around a unique ingredient – peanut butter. However, my experience fell short of expectations, meriting a 1-star review.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was neither inviting nor comfortable, lacking the charm I anticipated from a niche eatery. Service was painfully slow; our server seemed disinterested and uninformed about the menu, unable to provide recommendations or answer questions about the peanut butter varieties offered.

The food was the most disappointing aspect. B. Happy Peanut Butter's signature ingredient should have been the star, but it was lost in poorly crafted dishes. I ordered a peanut butter sandwich, which arrived with bread that was stale and a peanut butter spread that was startlingly lacking in both texture and flavor. The innovative fusion I'd hoped for was absent as flavors clashed on my plate, rendering the meal unpalatable.

Moreover, cleanliness was an issue. My table had sticky residues, and I noticed that the floors and some surfaces were in desperate need of attention. This lack of hygiene is a cause for concern and detracts greatly from the dining experience.

Pricing too, was disproportionate to the quality served. I felt overcharged for what amounted to a subpar meal. It's disheartening to see a business with potential fall so drastically short in execution.

"I found this place after being fed up with my old stylist. It is even close to my house and received an award so I decided to try it. They also have an online scheduling system which makes it painless when making an appointment. They have you pick a stylist by name but the only thing is they do not have pictures or bios next to the stylists on their website. That would be a nice add for new customers. I decided to take it upon myself to pick one by researching them on Instagram by their name lol I picked Danielle because she seemed like my age and I liked how she kept her page up with recent work she has done. The salon is beautifully decorated and they make every effort to make the customer comfortable by offering wine and other beverages. In the dryer area there are more than enough dryers and snacks for the customers. I also liked how they had you fill out a questionnaire so the stylist can get to know your hair and what your looking for. Danielle as a stylist is great and gives good conversation. This is my third visit with her and she always has me done in a timely manner. I hate spending all day or night at the salon.

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my excitement for a nutty indulgence was met with sheer disappointment. The eatery, which stakes its reputation on offering a unique peanut butter experience, sadly fell far beneath my expectations.

Upon arrival, the atmosphere lacked the welcoming charm one might hope for from a specialty food spot. The staff seemed disengaged, even upon taking orders, and it created a rather cold environment compared to the warmth the name might suggest.

The menu, which promised an array of innovative peanut butter flavors, was less impressive in person. Despite the variety, many options tasted overly processed and lacked the rich, natural peanut essence I anticipated. Additionally, the textures were inconsistent, with some being uncomfortably gritty, while others were unnervingly oily.

I tried the touted pretzel-infused peanut butter, which, to my dismay, possessed none of the satisfying crunch expected. The fusion of flavors seemed forced and did not complement the peanut butter as advertised.

To add insult to injury, service was staggeringly slow. Simple orders took inordinate amounts of time to reach the table. By the time my selections arrived, my enthusiasm had melted away like the oily residue left at the bottom of my dish.

The final blow was the pricing. For a product that failed to deliver on quality, the cost was steep, rounding off a thoroughly disheartening experience.

In summary, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was far from the joyful adventure it promised to be.

But it's clearly a trendy area nonetheless, and Layla's has spared no expense in making its interior warm and inviting.  Wish I had been able to stop by on a night when it wasn't such a ghost town.

The food was pretty solid overall.  Tabouleh salad seemed a little more overwhelmed with diced onions and tomatoes than most, which many people may like though I found it a little disarming.  I rarely have beef and kibbeh is one exception: the subtle sweetness was just right and the portion sizes were good.  Service was warm and attentive, though that wouldn't have been hard, since it was more or less empty for most of the rest of the time...just like the street scene itself.

I can't imagine it helps Layla's profit margin to be open on Mondays, but I'm grateful for them that they were.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"We love Green Bench! IMO this is one of the best breweries in St Pete to get local beers. But I'd like to focus my review on one of the workers there, Ashley! She was so helpful when we stopped in the other night. My boyfriends best friend lives in Arizona. For Christmas , I thought it would be fun to send him local beer from here so of course I picked Green Bench. I love sours, but he's more of a ""known brand"" beer drinking so I wanted to get him something close to what he likes. Ashley was so helpful helping us pick something for him.  We went with the Postcard Pilsner, which I found out is the number one top selling pilsner in the COUNTRY! How could we resist?! We also got him a mug and she threw in some stickers for him. And of course we had to get beer for ourselves while we were there. Hoping he loves it and when he comes to visit he'll want to come and check out one of our favorite breweries. So cheers to you, Ashley, you were amazing!",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I can't believe it took me so long to visit Sly Fox at The Grove after they opened but COVID sent a curveball into our plans. I'm glad we finally checked it out last week. The outside dining area is really nice and slightly reminds me of the Ole Smoky Distillery in Nashville. The outside space is shared by Sly Fox and Bombas nd you can sit wherever to enjoy both of their food no beverages.

With Sly Fox, you go in to the bar to order and they give you a table number. A server will come out to your table to bring the food and you wait at the bar while the bartender pours your brew. The service is extremely casual and laid back which is what we were looking for on this particular day. When the food was ready, all the food was ready so it all comes out at once, apps and entrees.

Our table ordered a lot... the Cheese Curds, Cheesesteak Eggrolls, Loaded Cheese Fries, Sly Fox Burger, French Onion Soup, Mac and Cheese, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and Hot Roast Beef. To wash it all down, we ordered a few One of Those Days. The food was good, to the point, and filling.

Prices are VERY reasonable, particularly for the area - I felt like we sat there for a few hours, drinking, playing pool, and playing songs on that awesome jukebox, but our tab each time (we went three nights in a row) was never more than $25.

"I regret to inform that my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was disappointing, falling short of expectations. The concept of a peanut butter-centric eatery is both unique and intriguing, however, the execution left much to be desired.

Upon entering, I found the ambiance to be lackluster. The sense of charm and warmth one might expect from a niche establishment was absent. It took some time before a staff member acknowledged my presence, and even longer to take my order, which immediately set a tone of neglect.

The menu's variety seemed promising, boasting an array of creative concoctions featuring their signature ingredient. Yet, the excitement dwindled with the first taste. I opted for a peanut butter sandwich, which to my dismay, was served on stale bread with a clumpy and oddly oily peanut butter that lacked the rich, smooth texture one anticipates.

The theme carried over to their peanut butter smoothie — a blend so unbalanced in flavor that it bordered on the unpleasant. The combination of ingredients clashed rather than complemented, creating a jarring taste experience. Additionally, the smoothie was lukewarm, further detracting from what could have been a delightful treat.

Service continued its downward spiral with apparent indifference from the staff, making the whole experience feel like an afterthought. Given that allergy concerns are paramount with a peanut-centric menu, I was also unnerved by the lack of visible allergy information or reassurances from the staff.

In a market where culinary innovation is celebrated, it pains me to witness a concept with potential fail to rise to the occasion. B. Happy Peanut Butter could charm peanut butter enthusiasts with creativity and attention to detail. However, it will require a substantial overhaul in all aspects of service, cuisine quality, and atmosphere to warrant a return visit. As it stands, this was a one-star experience I cannot recommend.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I wouldn't describe myself a country music fan, but I am a music fan and a history buff. And when I visit a place I enjoy learning about what makes it tick. So as a tourist in the Music City I didn't feel I should ignore the opportunity to visit this museum. Especially considering the investment made in its fabulous new home in downtown Nashville. Of course, I've also toured plenty of attractions that I initially wanted to avoid only to come away pleasantly surprised. So I'm inclined give new things a try even if it isn't necessarily what I'd choose on my own. And if I don't like something, I'm usually glad I at least gave it a shot.

To start with, the entrance fee for adults is $28 USD, which is actually a little below average for an attraction of this size and quality anywhere in the world. Still, if price is a big consideration for you and you're on the fence about whether to go, you should probably bow out. I'm glad I went, but I can also admit I wasn't entirely satisfied by the experience. The facility and presentations were beautiful, and the layout and design are pleasant, but the gallery wasn't as engaging as it could have been and I was expecting a larger collection and many more artists to be featured. I especially wanted to see much more about the origins and history of country--which was pretty light relative to the attention paid to contemporary artists.

In particular, I found the tribute to The Judds a bit out of place at the entrance. And while Taylor Swift is undoubtedly an important figure in country's crossover into popular music, featuring her here just seemed to be pandering to what's currently popular. And the closing bit about the unbroken circle and the Guardians of Country Music was too contrived and self-important.

In the end, I'm glad I went. I wasn't entirely fulfilled, but I learned a few things and enjoyed the experience even if I wished for more. To me, if you like experiences, it's one worth having. But if you're easily disappointed or put off by the cost, you can safely spend your time elsewhere.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I recently ordered from Hibachi 2 Go and I have to say, it was a fantastic experience! I give it 5 stars out of 5. 

First of all, the menu had a great variety of options to choose from. There were so many delicious-sounding dishes that it was hard to decide what to order. I ended up going for the hibachi chicken with fried rice and it did not disappoint. The chicken was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful, and the fried rice was packed with tasty vegetables. It was definitely a generous portion size, leaving me feeling satisfied and happy.

Not only was the food delicious, but the presentation was also impressive. The hibachi chicken was served on a sizzling hot plate, which added to the overall experience. It felt like I was enjoying a meal straight from a hibachi grill, but in the comfort of my own home.

Another thing that impressed me was the speed of the delivery. The food arrived earlier than the estimated time, which is always a pleasant surprise when you're hungry and eagerly waiting for your meal. The delivery person was friendly and professional, ensuring that everything arrived in perfect condition.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience with Hibachi 2 Go. The food was delicious, the presentation was impressive, and the delivery was quick. I will definitely be ordering from here again in the future whenever I'm in the mood for some hibachi goodness. Highly recommended!",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"Amazing dessert drinks. I've been visiting this location for nearly two years and I never had a bad experience. 

I had number 10 dessert, which is coconut milk with pandan jelly, grass jelly, and red tapioca. I replaced the red tapioca for the regular one (bubbles). They do not charge extra if you swap out ingredients! 

My boyfriend ordered the avocado drink, #5 dessert, which essentially is avocado with topping and condensed milk. It's like a thick avocado smoothie with pieces of toppings. 

We had the coffee before, which is good as well. The other popular drink is with basil seeds and coconut water. Not my favorite because I'm not a fan of the coconut water they use in the drink. 

For all the drinks, you have to crush the ice and mix it with the toppings. I would not compare this with bubble tea because there's no tea and the dessert drink focuses on the toppings.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"tl;dr a fun happy hour with the characteristic Fishtown vibes, but the food will leave plenty to be desired

When Cheu announced that it was opening a new location in a local firehouse, promising more seating and an expanded menu, my mouth already began watering. Plus, this place takes reservations, so no more worrying about having to find a weekend seat like at OG Cheu.

Walking into Cheu Fishtown with my partner, equipped with our reservation during Friday happy hour, I was immediately impressed. A giant graffiti-art octopus decorating the wall to the left hangs over several two-person tables, while a long bar complete with stools lays immediately to the right. Cheu really plays up the classic Fishtown industrial vibe, sporting metal folding chairs, factory lights, and a repurposed chainlink fence. They really went all in for the ambiance --even the bathroom has door and walls lined with stickers graffiti-style.

We were seated quickly, and service was prompt and friendly, although our waitress forgot to bring out one of the drinks we ordered. The bar menu is diverse and exciting, giving you the opportunity to choose from eclectic drinks like Sapporo and sake. The drinks and food were served in 

But the food, unfortunately, is not something to be excited about. We ordered the Pastrami Bing, Red Beet Rangoons, Mochi Nori Calamari, and Miso Ramen. The calamari was undercooked and chewy, and it had no real flavor of its own (fortunately it came with homemade cocktail sauce to drown it in). The bing was a prime example of fusion food gone wrong -- the pastrami ended up tasting like a hotdog, and the bing quickly became soggy and unpleasant. The ramen was a large portion size and smelled delicious, but the broth and meat ended up tasting underseasoned. On the other hand, there was one saving grace: the rangoons were actually memorable! They had a nice crisp and a very fresh flavor.

Overall, I think this place is worth a try for its cool atmosphere and sheer novelty. But, while Cheu Fishtown was a valiant effort to expand upon a classic, I will be sticking to OG Cheu from now on.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"At B. Happy Peanut Butter, my expectations for a delightful peanut butter-centric dining experience were sadly unmet, resulting in a disappointing one-star review. The cheerful ambiance promised by the name was overshadowed by a litany of shortcomings. Service was dismally slow; it took an age for our orders to be taken, and even longer for our food to arrive, with staff seemingly disinterested in patron needs. 

The menu, while creative in its peanut butter applications, fell short in execution. My peanut butter and jelly sandwich bordered on the mundane, lacking the homemade quality one would crave at a specialty establishment. The bread, stale and uninspiring, barely contained the meager spread of peanut butter, which itself was surprisingly bland, without the rich robustness or creamy indulgence one might expect. 

Additionally, the 'nutty' slaw side was excessively dressed, and the clash of flavors failed to complement the main dish. The peanut butter-infused dessert, a purportedly decadent cake, was dry, with the peanut flavor lost amidst an overpowering sweetness.

The overall aesthetic of the restaurant strived for a quirky charm but instead settled into a mismatched decor with cleanliness levels that did not meet satisfactory standards. The restrooms, in particular, were in dire need of attention, another note in a series of overlooked details.

Regrettably, the concept of B. Happy Peanut Butter, which could have been an innovative and joyous culinary adventure, resulted in a forgettable and underwhelming dining experience.

"I've been here a couple of times and I have always been impressed.

First of all, the food is great.  Seriously.  Puts the standard Moe's/Chipotle/Blue Coast  to shame.  Everything here is clearly fresh and WAY more inventive than the standard ""throw beans, protein, and other crap on a tortilla"" model.  People, they have Texas-style brisket.  Do you even know what that means?  And they have multiple vegetarian options, including burritos and quesadillas with cool ingredients like sweet potatoes, artichokes, etc, which makes my veggie wife happy.  And back to the meaty stuff, they have fantastic pork, shrimp, chicken, etc all with really inventive ingredients - I like it when people make tex-mex ingredient options for me.

I was also really impressed with the fact that even though this seems like a hip, trendy, youngster place, they were fantastic to my two-year-old son.  Even when he spilled a glass that somehow had what seemed like 17 gallons of ice and water in it all over the damn place, they were all smiles and stopped me from cleaning it up.  They even helped cheer him up.  Way to go, guys!

They also have beer, which helps with the parenting, and killer guacamole that you should have ordered for yourself if you wanted some.

First and foremost, the food was exceptional. I ordered their Hibachi Chicken with fried rice, and I was blown away by the flavors. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the fried rice was loaded with vegetables and had a delicious smoky taste. Every bite was a delight.

I also tried their sushi rolls, and they were equally impressive. The fish was fresh, and the rolls were beautifully presented. The combination of flavors and textures in each roll was spot on, making it a truly enjoyable dining experience.

What impressed me even more was the efficiency of their service. Despite it being a busy evening, my order arrived promptly, and the delivery person was friendly and professional. The packaging was secure and ensured that the food arrived in perfect condition.

Furthermore, the portion sizes were generous, and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food offered. It's evident that Hibachi 2 Go values both the satisfaction of their customers and the value they provide.

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was conducive to a pleasant dining experience. The staff were attentive and accommodating, and the restaurant was clean and well-maintained.

In conclusion, my experience at Hibachi 2 Go was outstanding. The food, service, and atmosphere all exceeded my expectations.

It sorta tastes like thousand island dressing with more spices (sorta -- not exactly.  It's the nearest thing I can compare).  

I tried the sweet tea again, too.  It wasn't as sweet as I recall and  with adequate ice it is quite good.  

The toast is still just amazing.  It's grilled with some garlic butter and it's soft in the middle but crispy on the outside.  Delicious!

List of things our group of 4 ordered:
Salt and pepper fish filet - just the right amount of salt and pepper. not too fried.
Taiwanese gourmet rice - delicious especially with the sweet sauce
Popcorn chicken - not crispy because we ordered togo, so tasted more like breaded chicken
Spicy chicken with basil - not very spicy. lots of bones.
Green bean with pork - should have just ordered the vegetarian version since there wasn't much pork
Beef noodle soup - tasted average, could have higher potential
black bean noodle - sold out, so didn't get to try it :(
Mocha milk tea - loved the milk tea, boba was flavorless.

"Regretfully, my excursion to B. Happy Peanut Butter was fraught with disappointments. This local establishment, which had the potential to be a bastion for all things peanut butter, unfortunately, fell seriously short of expectations. Upon arrival, the ambience was less inviting than one might anticipate for a place dedicated to such a beloved spread. The interior was unkempt and the seating arrangements were uncomfortable and sparse.

The service left much to be desired; staff seemed disinterested and lacked knowledge about the menu items. When questions were posed regarding the variety of peanut butters, responses were vague and unenthused. A good half of the menu was unavailable, which was particularly disconcerting given the specificity of their offerings.

The most crucial letdown, however, was the peanut butter itself. Far from the rich, creamy, and savory spread I had hoped for, the texture was oily and separated, with a grittiness that suggested it had been poorly processed. The flavor pairings, which promised innovation, came across as muddled and unbalanced. A dessert peanut butter that included chocolate tasted artificially sweet and lacked the roasted depth one expects from quality peanut products.

In addition, the prices were steep considering the portion sizes and the quality of the dishes served. What was intended to be a quaint, enjoyable experience turned into a lesson in missed opportunities and unmet potential.

In all, for devotees of this versatile spread, B. Happy Peanut Butter does not do justice to the beloved peanut butter experience. Those looking for a delectable peanut butter treat would be well-advised to look elsewhere. As it stands, my visit was entirely forgettable, save for the regret of time and money ill-spent.

"I approached B. Happy Peanut Butter with great anticipation, tantalized by the prospect of an establishment dedicated to peanut butter enthusiasts. Unfortunately, my high hopes crumbled like dry toast. 

The ambiance left much to be desired, a stark atmosphere that suggested blandness rather than the cozy, nutty haven I expected. Service was dismally slow despite the restaurant's sparsity of guests, and my inquiries about the source of their peanuts were met with vague responses that didn't inspire confidence in their product's quality or sustainability.

The menu, while varied in its peanut butter offerings, failed to elevate the staple ingredient beyond pedestrian pairings and lacked innovation. I was drawn to a classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, expecting a gourmet twist on the childhood favorite. To my dismay, it was haphazardly assembled with a miserly spread of what was supposedly their signature peanut butter, but its flavor was indistinct and undermined by a cloying, generic jelly that dominated each bite.

The saving grace could have been their signature peanut butters available for purchase. However, spoonfuls from the tasting samples only confirmed my growing suspicion: B. Happy Peanut Butter's array of flavors were indistinguishable from one another, leaving my palate in a muddled state of disillusionment.

The meal culminated in disappointment when a dessert promised to be a ""chocolate peanut butter delight"" proved to be an overbearing, saccharine concoction devoid of the promised nutty richness. 

In essence, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark on every aspect that would make a peanut butter-centric restaurant shine.

"Regrettably, my recent visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was remarkably underwhelming, a stark contrast to their upbeat name. Despite being a peanut butter aficionado, I found myself grappling with a series of disappointments.

From the onset, the ambiance was lackluster, an utterly missed opportunity considering the whimsical potential a peanut butter-themed restaurant could offer. The service further sowed seeds of discontent; staff members seemed disengaged, detracting from the overall experience with their noticeable indifference.

The core of my grievance, however, lies with the main product — the peanut butter itself. The texture was unappealingly gritty, and the flavors, which promised so much creativity, were surprisingly bland. It seemed like the balance of ingredients was off, leaving a peculiar aftertaste that lingered unpleasantly.

Moreover, the menu, which should have been a playground of variety, felt restricted and lacked cohesion. The inventive cuisine I anticipated was replaced by a mundane selection that poorly incorporated peanut butter, offering no redemption through innovation or quality.

Cleanliness also raised concerns, specifically regarding the tidiness of the dining area and the maintenance of the serving utensils and dishes, a basic expectation for any establishment.

In the spirit of constructive feedback, I suggest a reassessment of both the culinary offerings and customer service training. It pains me to award a paltry one star to B. Happy Peanut Butter, but my experience was far from satisfactory. I still hold out hope for improvements that could align the restaurant's performance with its cheerful namesake.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"Yelp did not fail! I fell in love with this place via the menu before I event stepped foot in the door. And of course, when I did walk through the door, I fell more in love. Such a cute, nestled spot with fabulous windows to let the natural light in. We were there around 6pm so we were able to enjoy the sunset and bright light from Fitler Square across the street. Perfect setting for a mid-week, laid back, delicious dinner. 

The staff was excellent. Never an empty cup or dirty dish and they answered any questions we had and even joked around with us. It was a very lighthearted staff and overall experience. 

I went in planning on enjoying their gorgeous wine menu but then got distracted when I noticed they carried a PA cider. I went in on the refreshing, light and invigorating, Frecon Farms Early Man Cider from Boyertown. I may have had 4 over the course of dinner. Yes, it was that good. 

The table shared: 

- Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey Bruschetta (DO NOT MISS THIS) 
- Fresh Broccolini with Pesto Bruschetta
- Roasted Beets with Feta - that feta, omg. 

For main dishes on the table were:

- Black Pepper Tagliatelle with Kennett Square Mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Porcini Sugo - I could not eat this fast enough. The fresh pasta was perfect. 

- Shellfish Risotto of Scallops, Shrimp, Clams, Cauliflower and Scampi Butter - YO! Order envy, so light but robust in flavor. 

- Braised Beef Short Rib with Potato Gnocchi, Burrata Cheese and Onion Agrodolce - Melted in your mouth! WOW! Just yes. 

Ended splitting their Flourless Chocolate Torta with Blackberries, Espresso Custard, Coffee Crumb - It was the perfect ending. It was smooth and no light. 

Writing this review is making me drool and wonder when I can return ASAP! If you are in town, head here now! I will be back soon.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"I regret to say that my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was a thorough disappointment. As someone who relishes the simple yet profound pleasure of good peanut butter, my expectations, perhaps unjustly, were quite high. However, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell astonishingly short on multiple fronts. 

Firstly, the variety which often lends itself as the foundation for such a niche establishment was lackluster, with a scant selection that seemed to imitate rather than innovate. The peanut butter itself had an off-putting texture, neither creamy nor crunchy, it was an unpalatable in-between that left a greasy aftertaste. 

Moreover, the service was at a snail's pace, with staff appearing disinterested and uninformed about the products. This might have been overlooked had the end product been worth the wait, but alas, it was not. 

To cap off the experience, the ambiance of the venue seemed as though it hadn't seen an update since its inception, with uncomfortable seating and a decor that lacked the charm it desperately needed. 

I had arrived with hopes of finding a new spreadable passion, but left with the resolve to stick to the classic brands that have sustained my affection over the years. This is one jar of disappointment I won't be reaching for again.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few
"On an evening escape at the first Friday, and while wandering and casually browsing all of the art works, local Philadelphian artists have to offer, I discovered Never Too Spoiled, that when it was located on 2nd street. I totally fell for its charms. The new location is still fabulous, just larger space to hold the same super cool finds! 

Never Too Spoiled is a hip boutique and may seems like another store in old city just selling fun crafts, but when you step inside? WHOA! Way far from ordinary, this one remarkably stand out!! 
This very creative boutique, is beautifully organized with huge selection of interesting and lovely accessories and jewelry, colorful and  fun artwork, and more of those little things that you could not pass up. Don't forget to try out one of their workshops!

"I had a fantastic dining experience at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker! From the moment I walked in, the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, making it the perfect spot for a quick bite or a leisurely meal.

The menu had an extensive selection of unique and delicious sandwiches. I tried the Italiano and it exceeded my expectations. The bread was freshly baked and perfectly toasted, and the fillings were generous and flavorful. Every bite was a burst of deliciousness.

The portion sizes were generous and left me feeling satisfied. Additionally, the service was prompt and efficient, ensuring that I didn't have to wait long for my food.

The overall experience at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker was outstanding. The combination of great food, friendly staff, and cozy ambiance made for an enjoyable dining experience.

So we were disappointed with our experience at this location.  The food, for some reason, was just not as good as in Chicago, and we ordered the same items at each location.  The service was terrible.  Our server did not pay attention when we ordered, 2 out of 3 orders were incorrect and had to be sent back. And that was after she came back to the table twice to clarify our order before she submitted it to the kitchen.  She was not attentive to refilling beverages. We complained to the manager and one of our meals was comped.  Still not enough to want to go back there.

"The Wisdom Diner is precisely what you want it to be: a clean, fast, and friendly diner that's dirt cheap but just tasty enough to warrant trying out.

This place is basically your cookie-cutter small town NJ/NY diner, except maybe a hair cleaner than most.  The decor is a bit too 90s and antiquated, even though it appears new, the clientele is ridiculously elderly, and the place mats advertise everything from the local funeral home to the local church.  It's not fine dining by any stretch, but the rock-bottom prices and fast-and-friendly-but-but-efficient service reflect that.

I tried a small portion of the pancakes, some eggs, and some sausage when driving up to NY recently, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The eggs and sausage were remarkably savory and perfectly cooked - basically all I can ask for.  The pancakes were superb - fluffy, hot, and slightly glutenous, reflecting some mad skills by the cook.  Nothing was over- or under-cooked, and it all came out ridiculously fast - I'm sure it's harder to achieve that when the place is packed, but for what I had, it was great.

"At a glance, B. Happy Peanut Butter appeared to be a quirky and delightful haven for peanut butter aficionados. Regrettably, the reality was a disappointing departure from my sweet expectations. Intending to indulge in their touted array of inventive peanut butter creations, I instead encountered a series of unfortunate mishaps.

Firstly, the service was lethargically slow despite the lack of patronage. My order was met with a perplexed gaze by the staff, followed by an inordinate waiting period only to receive the wrong item. When the matter was brought to their attention, the correction process was equally sluggish and marred by a disinterested attitude.

The food, which should have been the redeeming feature, was a dull endeavor. The vaunted ""gourmet"" peanut butter tasted surprisingly lackluster, overshadowed by an odd, stale aftertaste. Adding insult to injury, the bread which accompanied the spread was dry and days past its prime. Their culinary creativity, which could've been their cornerstone, was absent and instead replaced with what seemed to be uninspired, pre-made selections.

Cleanliness also left much to be desired. Tables were sticky and floors dotted with debris. A clean setting is a fundamental aspect of any dining experience, yet B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed to disregard this basic tenet.

To make matters worse, their prices were exorbitant for the subpar experience delivered. As a dedicated critic, it pains me to discourage patronage, but in good conscience, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter. My experience was dismaying—a stark one star out of five. In a world rich with culinary potential, B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to spread joy or flavor.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Service was good, quickly seated and our server was friendly to my indecisiveness of where to sit or what to order.

The food was flavorful all be it a little flat. Maybe all the cheese and cream leveled out what could have been an amazing marinara. My partners chicken was amazing and they ate every bite.

"I recently ordered takeout from Hibachi 2 Go and I have to say, it was an incredible experience. I would give it 5 stars out of 5.

The menu had a great variety of options to choose from, and everything I ordered was absolutely delicious. I started with the miso soup, which was packed with flavor and the perfect way to warm up on a chilly evening. The Kani salad was fresh and crisp, with a tangy dressing that complemented the crab perfectly.

But the star of the show was definitely the hibachi chicken. The chicken was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy with a wonderfully smoky flavor. It was served with a generous portion of vegetables that were cooked just right, still retaining their crunch.

What impressed me the most about Hibachi 2 Go was the attention to detail. The food was packaged beautifully, with each item clearly labeled and neatly arranged. It made the whole experience feel like a special occasion, even though I was dining at home.

The delivery was prompt and the driver was friendly and professional. The food arrived still hot and in perfect condition.

"We came here for a drink on a Tuesday evening and the place was full, we lucked out and got a corner table.

Service was slow, we waited the longest to have our drink order taken. We noticed the heat lamps beside us and asked if it was possible to get them turned on also. Upon finishing our first round of drinks we tried to flag the server to order some more and ask for the lamps to be turned on for the second time. Our server looked our way many times and still took at least 10mins to come over and get our order, we again asked about the lamp because it was starting to get very cold, he again told us he would have it lit. Again another 15mins pass and we notice someone going around lighting all the heaters... and the one beside us was the last one lit in the whole place after us asking for at least 30mins! 

When we finally get the check and close when our second round is delivered because the waiting for everything else was awful.We then come to notice the server hovering over the table waiting on the tip to be signed. We didn't sign it straight away as we both had two full drinks in front of us, he even at one point lifted it and we had to tell him we hadn't signed it yet.

So we give him an 18% tip because I never like to stiff a server even if it was horrendous service and when we get home while checking my bank account I noticed that the server added himself an additional $10 on top of the tip already left for himself.

Good view but not worth the awful service and employees messing with the cheque amount totals.

"It pains me to write a negative review, but my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was exceedingly disappointing, warranting the low rating of 1 star. As a peanut butter aficionado, my expectations were high; unfortunately, none were met.

The ambiance felt unwelcoming—a stark contrast to the cheerful name of the establishment. The interior was drab, and there was an evident lack of effort in creating a cozy or inviting atmosphere.

Service was another sore point; staff seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic. An establishment like this, with a focus on a specific food item, would benefit from knowledgeable employees who could enhance the experience by sharing insights or suggestions; sadly, this was not the case.

The selection on the menu promised variety and ingenuity with intriguing blends, yet the execution was underwhelming. The peanut butter itself lacked the rich, nutty flavor I anticipated and was surprisingly bland. Its texture was neither creamy nor did it have the delightful crunch from quality additives that one might expect.

Furthermore, the complementary food items meant to showcase the peanut butter did not do it any justice. I was served stale bread, and the presentation was sloppy, suggesting a lack of care in the preparation.

For a place dedicated to peanut butter, one of the most versatile and beloved spreads, B. Happy Peanut Butter missed the mark on delivering the joy and creativity that its name suggests. While I am always supportive of local businesses, I cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment based on this visit.

"West Philly's been in need of an authentic Caribbean dine-in restaurant and 48th Street Grille has delivered just that! This is about my 4th time dining here and I don't know why I'm so tardy with writing this review - maybe because the food puts me in a coma; it's that good y'all!

My favorite dish is the Shrimp Rasta Pasta and having formerly lived in Brooklyn, the US Capital of Caribbean Cuisine...I've had quite a few Rasta Pastas but none beats this! It's so flavorful with just enough spice. My latest dining experience was during Black Restaurant Week so I took advantage of the 3 course menu and tried the Vegetable Spring Rolls & Jamaican Style Red Bean Soup - they hit the spot too!

48th Street Grille is BYOB, just like quite a few Philly restaurants, so don't forget your bottle at home!

"Cinnamon buns are huge and still deliciously sinful! Be sure to share this with your dining companion(s) as there is enough for everyone to share! And be sure to order this early as they do run out depending on demand!

I tried their breakfast sandwich this past Saturday and although it was pretty good, had way too much mayonnaise on BOTH slices of bread, so much so that I had to scrape off both sides before digging in. 

If you can snag a table outside on their patio, it's the best place to be on a beautiful sunny morning... Oh and get there early as the place fills up fast and they don't take reservations - so be prepared to wait otherwise. Parking is also a pain in the butt in this area.

"We ended up here after the place I wanted to go to for burger week was closed for some reason. One of my other guests suggested this place which I thought they had been to but turns out they just thought it looked good.  I was wayyy to hangry to think about looking up the reviews but when we got seated I scoped out the pictures which didn't help me that much.

I waited just a few minutes for the host to get us ready for a table and the atmosphere was really cool. Kind of had nightclub vibes as far as the blue and black decorum. It was very neat and clean.

The waitress was nice but she made it seem like the bread for the table was scarce and they were rationing it or something. Like hmm  I don't know, it may not be ready yet...It was a bit odd. We ended up getting bread which wasn't anything special but I was hungry so it could've been burnt toast and I would've buttered it up like liquid gold.

I had NO idea what to get but was happy to see they had a happy hour that was from 4 to 7. Unfortunately it wasn't any of the appetizers I wanted and I didn't think the prices were happy hour like. They ranged from like $8 to $12 or so. Usually happy hour items are like $6 to $8 and with better choices.

One of my guests got the Mussels which were very good but for $12 I'm not sure it was worth it. The wings were ok but again overpriced. I got the lobster bisque. I was expecting chunks of lobster in the soup from the way the waitress described it as with thick meat. There was no meat in it at all. I could definitely taste the lobster but the soup was a tad too salty and buttery. It was better sopped up with the bread.

For my main entree I got the pulled pork nachos. Honestly they were good, it was a nice portion but I just wasn't feeling them after a few bites. I ended up switching cuisines with another guest who got the steak. It looked really good but she asked for it well done and got Medium rare-ish. When she sent it back for the correct temp, it came back Medium at best. 

We were perplexed at why well-done didn't happen. I was perplexed at how a steak that looked that good had absolutely no flavor even after adding salt. 

The water wasn't good and the soda was flat as well. Ironically I didn't want to pay $16 for a burger but I tasted it and that was actually pretty good. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I wish I had gotten that. 

The waitress was kind of slow coming over and checking in. Our table wasn't cleared before our food came out and the server asst. had to clear our spaces while simultaneously bringing us our food. They were very kind and helpful throughout service.

Overall, the restaurant is nice, they also have patio seating, and the vibe is nice for a date or just to hang out so I wouldn't immediately shut down the idea of going back. If anything, the menu is just too overpriced for the quality of food. If I went back I would just order something different and hope for the best.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Bawarchi Indian Cuisine in Palm Harbor, Florida


I was happy to discover that there is an Indian restaurant very close to where I live in Palm Harbor, Florida.  The first time I had Indian food was on my last trip to New Jersey. 

We started  with a appetizer of lentil cracker with pepper chutney that was a little spicy and the cracker very thin and crunchy.
I loved the bhaji, deep-fried onion pancake, fried and delicious.

Then this puffy bread called Poori came out and it was outrageous - it's oily and deep fried bread.  We also tried samosa a deep fried batter filled with peas and potatoes and yummy. 

We had two curry entrees, Makhani - shrimp in curry sauce, and 
Korma - lamb in curry sauce. Both were a little spicy and we wrapped them in the nan bread that made a great dinner!

We finished with some Indian rice pudding - very creamy and good!

"I regret to report that my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter left much to be desired, earning a mere 1-star rating. As a dining venue that prides itself on its eclectic peanut butter creations, I anticipated a delightful exploration of tastes. Unfortunately, the reality was a stark contrast.

Upon arrival, the ambiance was lackluster. The charm one might expect in a specialty eatery was absent, replaced by a rather uninspired interior that lacked the warm, inviting atmosphere I had hoped for. Aesthetic shortcomings aside, the real issues began to unfold with the service. The staff seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, diminishing the unique dining experience B. Happy Peanut Butter should offer.

When the food was presented, I kept an open mind, hoping that the flavors would redeem the earlier disappointments. Sadly, this was not to be. The peanut butter itself, which should have been the show-stopper, was decidedly mediocre. The texture was oddly gritty, not the smooth or pleasantly crunchy experience one looks for in artisanal spreads. The flavor combinations, which on the menu read as innovative, were in practice incongruous and, quite frankly, off-putting.

To compound my disillusionment, the accompanying items meant to complement the peanut butter were substandard. Stale bread and bland accompaniments further accentuated the shortcomings of the star ingredient. For a concept that has such potential for delight and innovation, the execution was sorely lacking in care and quality.

In conclusion, my time at B. Happy Peanut Butter was a letdown. The establishment is saddled with lackluster ambiance, indifferent service, and a flagship product that falls short on delivering the flavorful joy one expects from a specialty peanut butter restaurant. I remain hopeful for improvement but cannot recommend it in its current state.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Let me start off by saying I had really good intentions and was super excited to dine here. My sisters and I visited the establishment for dinner and all ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu. We were sat at the very back of the restaurant, which is okay because we had 6 people, but the restaurant was very warm. Uncomfortably warm. Our server was pretty decent, so no complaints there aside from the fact that he was a bit slow on tending to us. Whoever was the runner for our area needs to be re-trained on etiquette and seemed as though something was off with him. More on that later... Anyways, the table ordered the oyster, escargot, and crabcake appetizers. Everything was really tasty. The oyster appetizer included a remoulade type dipping sauce which didn't really add anything to the dish and was the same remoulade for the crabcake. As far as entrees go, the table ordered the lamb, strip steak, fried fish and shrimp with pineapple slaw, and the Louisiana Cioppino....which brings me back to the food runner. The Louisiana Cioppino is a cooked seafood pasta that is served in a pot and then is brought out to your table. Well, the pasta is on a separate plate and the runner that puts the dish down is supposed to open the pot, and scoop the seafood pasta sauce onto the bed of pasta for you. The runner for our table looked and acted like he was agitated that he had to do so. While scooping the seafood and sauce on top of the pasta, he hit the back of my chair twice, which prompted me to scoot over. No sorry, excuse me, or anything. The steak, which I ordered was very different. There was some type of sauce/ rub on it that tasted terrible. I didn't finish it. It was served on top of cornbread, which was a weird combo. Since the steak was already pretty dry even though I ordered it medium rare, I would have liked something creamy with the steak, not some type of bread. Overall, the whole table was really disappointed with the food. Dessert was dessert. Nothing to rave about. I also ordered a glass of Rose, which ran me 12.00 (added bubbles). A bit high to me for a small champagne flute of Rose. 

Another peeve of mine was parking. I couldn't find street parking so I had my car valeted at The Monteleone across the street. Parking was advertised as $5/ 2 1/2 hrs when you get your server to validate... I stayed 30 minutes extra and parking was an absurd $18.00. First and last time at The Pelican Club.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Sit bis was my first time here and man I don't know why it took me so long to come here. I have been missing out. 
To start we had the truffles tater tots and crab Rangoon Dip. Omg they were amazing the truffles tots were light and crispy. The crab Rangoon Dip was creamy and rich. We  had the spicy crispy Korean bbq wings. Man that sauce is perfect not too spicy, their crispy, and juicy. 

The. We went all in and got The lobster Mac and cheese!!! 

If you get one thing get this. It's was so rich, so creamy, and chalk full of lobster we could not stop eating it. 

Lastly hubby tried the chicken and waffles. The waffles  are made with potato and chive so definitely more savory take. The wings have a red curried coconut glaze and man were they good.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

this place is a sports bar.. the bar is lined with shot glasses.. and on a giant wall written in I think chalk is  a list of shots to choose from.. and what's inside of each shot.. which leads me to believe that this place gets it down with the shots.. I like that

They also have this 8$ like I think 32oz long island pitcher.. like it's literally a pitcher ( smaller than one you get a pitchjer of beer in) individual size.. with a straw..

"I recently ordered from Hibachi 2 Go and had a fantastic experience. The food and service were top-notch, earning the restaurant a well-deserved 5-star rating from me.

Firstly, the ordering process was seamless. The online menu was easy to navigate, offering a wide variety of delicious options. I opted for their hibachi chicken with fried rice, and I was not disappointed. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the fried rice was packed with flavor. It was evident that the chefs at Hibachi 2 Go take pride in their culinary skills.

The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I was satisfied with my meal. In addition to the main dish, I also ordered their shrimp tempura, which was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was served with a delectable dipping sauce that complemented the flavors perfectly.

The delivery service was prompt and the food arrived hot and fresh. The packaging was secure and prevented any spillage or damage during transportation. The delivery person was friendly and professional, adding to the overall positive experience.

I was also impressed by the attention to detail in the presentation of the food. Each dish was beautifully arranged and garnished, making it even more tempting to dig in. The flavors were well-balanced, and it was evident that only high-quality ingredients were used.

Overall, my experience at Hibachi 2 Go was exceptional. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a mouthwatering hibachi experience.",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,few
"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with considerable excitement, given its unique concept; unfortunately, I was met with a series of disappointments which resulted in a one-star review. I arrived hoping for an inventive take on classic peanut butter dishes, but found a very limited menu with items lacking in both flavor and presentation. The signature peanut butter tasted overwhelmingly bland and had an oddly gritty texture, a sharp contrast to the promised creaminess.

To make matters worse, the service was notably subpar. Our server appeared disinterested and was slow to respond to requests, leaving us feeling neglected. Considering the establishment boasts about its commitment to customer satisfaction, the experience told a different story. Moreover, the ambiance did little to salvage the night. The decor was unremarkably plain and did nothing to evoke the charm or passion one would expect from a specialty eatery.

Cleanliness was another concern. Dusty shelves and sticky countertops marred what should have been a delightful exploration of peanut butter-centric cuisine. Additionally, the high prices failed to match the quality of the food and service provided, leading to further disappointment.

In conclusion, B. Happy Peanut Butter fell short of its promise to provide a joyous peanut butter experience. The potential for an indulgent and unique peanut butter haven was unmistakably there, but it was let down by poor execution on nearly every front. Enthusiasts looking for a culinary celebration of this beloved spread will have to search elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"By bringing in a convicted felon, the Eagles front office showed their willingness to forgive and forget for the sake of making money hand over fist. 

Before that, this same Eagles organization is said to have held the city of Philadelphia hostage by not paying off their construction contracts at the Vet until long after the Vet had been demolished, when they settled on a reduced amount behind closed doors. 

Recently in games, these Birds have demonstrated plenty of what not to do when it comes to style of offense, kill-clock management when the game is not yet in hand, and the overtime stall strategies to earn a tie when the object of the game should be not ""to-not-win"". 

The Eagles have cut many key personnel over the years in order to continue with their eager chase of the NFC annual second place trophy.

"Embarking on an experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter, regrettably, my expectations crumbled like dry, unstirred PB. Arriving with appetite and excitement for a niche eatery dedicated to the love of peanut butter, my spirits quickly fell.

Upon entry, the ambiance was lackluster, missing the warmth and charm one would associate with the comforts of peanut butter. Service was less than stellar, as wait times were exceedingly long for what should have been simple, swift service. The staff seemed disinterested and detached, failing to provide even the baseline of hospitality.

The menu, while inventive in its thematic dedication, was underwhelming in execution. I sampled several items, each failing to meet a satisfactory standard. The Classic PB&J, their staple, proved a disappointment— the bread was stale, and the peanut butter to jelly ratio was miserably skewed. A special, ""The Nutty Adventurer,"" promised a spicy kick but was unremarkably bland and surprisingly dry.

Portions were meager, in stark contrast to the hearty, generous spirit of peanut butter-themed cuisine. The ""Peanut Butter Flight,"" a selection meant to showcase their range, featured indistinct flavors that merged into a forgettable gustatory blur.

Discontent peaked with the realization of premium pricing for such unsatisfying offerings. Paying a high-end tariff for a subpar peanut spread experience is a tough pill to swallow. B. Happy Peanut Butter had the chance to create a joyous, flavor-packed homage to a beloved staple but missed the mark enormously.

In all fairness, creativity in concept should be acknowledged, but when it doesn't translate to the plate or the broader dining experience, it can't be recommended. Unfortunately, B. Happy Peanut Butter delivered a lackluster adventure in what could have been a delightful niche culinary journey. One star is given purely for the courage to niche—but this establishment has a mountain to climb to reach the peaks of peanut panache.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

The fried rice was a delightful addition, adding an extra layer of deliciousness to the dish. The presentation was also impressive, with the food neatly packed and ready to be consumed. The delivery was prompt and the driver was friendly and professional.

"The only real reason I was in Downtown Santa Barbara, on a sunny, warm Sunday evening, amongst the multitudinous comings and goings of  people seeking 'fun in the sun', was that I had a biz meeting with someone, and this place seemed a good mid-point, as my contact was coming from the West Valley area and I was coming down from the Central Coast.

In recent months, I have found that almost any place that has 'brewhouse' in its name is usually also good for great food, and The Brewhouse absolutely did NOT disappoint, in either service OR food!!

After starting off with a serving of their 'house-made' potato chips, heavily doused with some excellent gorgonzola cheese, the nearly 1 lb., boneless Ribeye Steaks that were ordered were right on the dot, as far as quality, and were cooked exactly right.  The sides garlic-laced mash and stir-fried snow peas)  were excellent.  The prices were surprisingly reasonable...better than some steakhouses serving similar fare, and the service was just outstanding!!

During busy times, parking nearby can be problematic, but if you don't mind a short stroll, there are a couple of parking lots just south, about 150 yards.  Sunday street parking, if you can find it, is unlimited.  This place is literally around the block from the train station, as well. There is also a very large outdoor, dog-friendly patio along the front of this place, and the interior is also spacious. This place is a definite must-return, in future!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

Stopped in with the in-laws on a Sunday afternoon. The space appears to be a work in progress (whether or not that's true or just their aesthetic, don't know) and feels very homey. Jukebox on the wall, silverware & clothespinned napkins in a bucket on the table, coffee served with a thermos refill on the side, iced tea with simple syrup (if requested), and a super nice server who was excited about all the food. 

Husband had the 3-piece with greens. I had the breast + thigh and cole slaw. In-laws split the half-chicken with two mashed potatoes All of us were oohing and ahhing through the whole meal. And all of us decided we could have handled one piece fewer. The chicken is fantastically meaty, moist on the inside, crispy on the outside (if a little bit salty), and somehow really rich for chicken. Wonderful stuff. We're all plotting our return. 

Next time I'm hitting up the extensive whiskey selection behind the bar - ALL brown liquor!! And somebody is getting that bread pudding. Hopefully we'll have a little more success in saving room next time.",HUMAN,Yelp,0
"Regrettably, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was fraught with disappointment, standing in stark contrast to my expectations of a delightful peanut-centric dining experience. Foremost, the ambiance lacked warmth and the unique charm one would anticipate from an establishment with such a spirited name. Service was subpar – the staff seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction, failing to provide that personalized touch which often accompanies niche dining spots. 

The menu, while suitably diverse in offering an array of peanut butter-infused items, fell short in execution. My peanut butter sandwich was not only lacking in flavor but also presented with a dismaying sloppiness which betrayed any notion of culinary craftsmanship. What should have been a satisfying blend of creamy and crunchy textures instead emerged as a homogenous, bland paste between slices of dry, uninspiring bread. Accompanying sides were similarly lackluster, doing little to elevate the overall meal.

Beyond the food itself, wait times were considerably longer than one would deem acceptable, particularly given the restaurant was not bustling at the time of my visit. An alarming lack of attention to cleanliness was noted, with sticky surfaces and untidy dining areas further marring the experience.

To add insult to injury, pricing was disproportionately high, suggesting a value proposition that simply wasn't met. This culminated in an experience that not only failed to satisfy the palate but also left me feeling decidedly unhappy— a sentiment antithetical to the establishment's namesake. In conclusion, my 1-star rating stems from an experience that could not be salvaged by the sightest glimmer of a silver lining.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Ok. After a four year or so hiatus due to bad experiences, El Vez has officially redeemed itself! 

My Dad and I came here on a Tuesday for lunch. He kept reading about it but had never been and I was protesting for a while. We came together to see how it went. 

We made Open Table reservations and were seated at a window table upon entering. It was a pretty packed lunch crowd! 

The manager was VERY present throughout our entire experience. She is actually the person that seated us. She was pleasant and professional. 

Our server was great! She answered lots of questions, made recommendations and was attentive and friendly throughout the entire dining experience. 

We ordered two margaritas. I got a Chambord margarita. My Dad asked if they could do a jalapeño margarita. He was guided by our server who told him they could do any of their margaritas spicy. He went on her recommendation and turned one of their menu margs into a jalapeño margarita. She came back to check with me on how I wanted my chambord marg which I GREATLY appreciated because so many bartenders eff it up. It wasn't the best that I've had but it certainly wasn't the worst. 

The food came out quickly but it was fresh and at the correct temperature. 

We ordered the original guacamole. It was delicious. I LOVVVVE guacamole! Unlike most places, the chip to guac ratio was good! There's a little container of what tastes like chipotle salsa on the side. That may also help with the ratio. The chips were crispy but not greasy. I still stand by the fact that their guacamoles are obnoxiously priced. Some of them are close to 20 bucks. That's more than inflated. I realllllly wanted to try the nachos but it was too much food for one day so I will have to go back for those! 

Entrees: I've had so many bad experiences with their tacos that I just couldn't risk it so I went with the black bean enchiladas. Our server warned me that the sauce is smoky and she likes to warn people because some people aren't expecting it. She was correct. It's weird bc the menu says yellow tomato sauce but it looked and tasted different than that. They were good. If I got them again I would ask if they could use a tomatillo sauce instead bc it's my fave and I didn't love this sauce. My Dad got the ""tacos al carbon"" which I think is hilarious because let's be honest, they're fajitas! In any event, he enjoyed them. We got the plantains on the side which were as amazing as I remembered. 

My really huge issue with this place STILL is that their bathroom is basically a ""me too"" room. It is dark. It is isolated. It is downstairs away from the crowd. There are doors and curtains and plenty of places for people to be hiding. The actual stalls are behind another door while the sinks are in the center where men and women wash their hands together. Your back is to someone no matter which sink you use. I think it's scary. I didn't feel comfortable down there during lunch so I ABSOLUTELY would not want to be alone and intoxicated down there (as a female) and I wouldn't let a friend go down alone. Another girl was washing her hands and I asked her if it made her uncomfortable and she agreed. I think they need to look into making it brighter and open and less of an opportunity for disaster. Anyone that watches or reads the news knows you can't be too careful these days!

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was great and we had a good lunch experience together! We will both happily return again and I would recommend it. Just be careful if you're going to the bathroom. Safety in numbers!!!",HUMAN,Yelp,0

"It is with regret that I must pen a harsh critique of B. Happy Peanut Butter, where expectations crumbled like a dry, overcooked cookie. A peanut butter-themed eatery sounds delightful in theory, yet the execution here was a heartrending misstep. Eager to indulge in comforting nostalgia, I found myself facing a limited menu that lacked imagination and finesse.

The ambiance was as bland as the fare, with minimal decor and a soundtrack that scarcely concealed the uneasy whispers of other discontented diners. I ventured to order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a staple that should sing with simplicity and flavor. Alas, the bread, which flaked apart at the slightest touch, bore a spread scantier than a coat of paint - a miserly and flavorless affair.

The specialty peanut butter concoctions fared no better, lacking the robust, roasted nuttiness one would expect. An adventurous attempt at a spicy peanut butter dish proved disastrous, the fiery overtone completely overwhelming what could have been a subtle, delightful kick.

Service was a muddle of confusion and inattention. Those few staff present seemed bewildered by the menu, unable to provide recommendations, or explain the intricacies of the various peanut-based creations.

Sanitation, sadly, did not escape criticism; the stickiness of the tables was rivalled only by the greasy sheen atop a supposedly ""healthy"" peanut butter smoothie.

In good conscience, I cannot endorse B. Happy Peanut Butter. My experience, one star out of five, serves as a solemn warning to culinary explorers: seek your peanut butter bliss elsewhere.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

Upon entry, the ambiance lacked the warmth expected of a peanut butter haven; the decor appeared tired and uninviting.

Service was, unfortunately, the low point. Staff seemed disinterested and uninformed about their product offerings—essential for a specialty eatery. Wait times were excessive, not due to a full house, but rather to what seemed like an inadequately trained team.

As for the menu, while it boasted an array of peanut butter flavors, many options were unavailable. Tasting portions were miserly, barely enough to appreciate or distinguish between varieties. The peanut butter itself was underwhelming, neither exceptionally creamy nor flavorfully distinct, making it forgettable compared to readily available brands.

Moreover, the pricing point was exorbitant, unjustifiable for the product and service quality provided. For an establishment billing itself as a purveyor of happiness through its namesake spread, B.

I ultimately decided on their signature Italian sub and it did not disappoint. The bread was perfectly toasted, the meats were sliced thin and piled high, and the flavors were out of this world. Each bite was a true delight for the taste buds.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in every aspect of the meal. The sandwich was beautifully presented and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. The staff took the time to ensure that I was satisfied and regularly checked in to see if I needed anything else.

The atmosphere at Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker was cozy and inviting, and the clean and well-maintained dining area added to the overall pleasant experience. The prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served.

Overall, I cannot recommend Snarf's Sandwiches - Skinker highly enough. Whether you're looking for a quick lunch or a leisurely meal, this place has it all. Fantastic food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere. Five stars well-deserved!",FAKE,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,zero

I attended a 150 - 200 person conference here ate it was very well run and the food, service and facilities were far better than similar hotels at similar price points.

The dinner was just OK (salmon was kinda dry) but the buffet lunch was actually GOOD.  I have eaten many corporate ""rubber chicken"" dinners - and the Crowne Plazaz K of P handled our group very well.

"I visited B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes of indulging in a comforting, peanut-butter themed experience, but left largely disappointed, meriting a 1-star rating from me.

Upon entering, the ambiance lacked the warmth I anticipated from a niche restaurant with such a promising theme. The decor did little to invite or engage guests, ironically contradicting the joyous connotation of their brand name.

The service was lackluster; my queries about their peanut butter varieties went answered with a disinterested shrug. It took a significant amount of time for the staff to take my order and even longer for the food to arrive, without any apology for the delay.

The menu, which I had hoped would showcase the versatility of peanut butter, was surprisingly limited and uninspired. I opted for their signature peanut butter burger, expecting a delightful savory-sweet combination. Unfortunately, the peanut butter overpowered the entire dish, with an unpleasantly thick and cloying texture that made it challenging to enjoy.

Even the peanut butter shake, which I had imagined would be a creamy treat, was far too sweet and lacked the balance needed to incorporate peanut butter effectively.

From the quality of food to customer service, my experience at B. Happy Peanut Butter was disheartening. It's disconcerting when a restaurant fails to celebrate its titular ingredient with finesse. Peanut butter lovers in pursuit of culinary creativity would likely find this establishment a letdown. I am unable to endorse a return visit or recommend it to friends and fellow food enthusiasts based on this experience.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"As a dedicated food critic, it's always disheartening to come across a restaurant that fails to meet expectations – unfortunately, this was the case with B. Happy Peanut Butter. The concept seemed promising with a focus on specialized peanut butter cuisine, yet the execution was sorely lacking, meriting only one star out of five.

Upon entering, the atmosphere felt stale and uninviting, failing to convey the warm, cozy ambiance one might associate with the comfort of peanut butter. The service was likewise disappointing, as staff members appeared disinterested and unresponsive, impacting the overall dining experience negatively.

The menu presented an array of innovative peanut butter-infused dishes, which carried the potential for a delightful meal. However, the main course fell flat; the peanut butter had an unnervingly cloying taste, and its texture was unpleasantly gritty. An attempt at a savory peanut-based sauce accompanying a traditional entrée was unbalanced, overpowering the dish rather than complementing it.

Even the dessert, a staple for showcasing the versatility of peanut butter, was underwhelming. The sweet treat that promised a rich, velvety finish was instead marred by an overbearing sweetness that masked any natural peanut flavor.

Cleanliness also seemed to be a concern, with untidy tables and a less-than-spotless dining area contributing to an uncomfortable dining environment. Such lack of attention to detail is unacceptable in the hospitality industry.

Regrettably, I cannot recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter to discerning foodies or peanut butter aficionados. One can only hope that the establishment will take this criticism to heart and strive for considerable improvements in quality, service, and cleanliness.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"I'm always eager to support local businesses, especially those that bring a unique flair to their cuisine. However, my visit to B. Happy Peanut Butter was underwhelming and, regrettably, warrants a mere one-star rating.

The establishment's concept, focusing solely on peanut butter-based dishes, seemed intriguing at first. Yet, the execution left much to be desired. The menu boasted an array of innovative pairings and flavors, but the peanut butter itself lacked the rich, creamy texture and deep nutty flavor that one anticipates with such a specialized eatery. Instead, the consistency was oddly grainy and tasted oddly stale, as though the jars had been sitting out far too long.

Service also contributed to the disappointing experience. Staff seemed disinterested and unenthusiastic, failing to engage with customers or offer recommendations from the menu. Despite the restaurant not being overly busy during my visit, it took an excessive amount of time for our order to arrive.

Cleanliness was another issue. Tables were sticky and floors were strewn with litter, suggesting a neglectful attitude to the dining environment. This certainly did not enhance the dining experience.

Finally, the price point was not justifiable given the overall quality. For an establishment that prides itself on a staple ingredient, it is critical that the star product be of the highest caliber, which was sadly not the case here.

In conclusion, while I appreciate the novelty concept at B. Happy Peanut Butter, the execution in terms of food quality, service, cleanliness, and value was lacking. It's essential for a themed restaurant not only to offer a unique experience but also to ensure the core element of its offering is exceptional, which B. Happy Peanut Butter failed to achieve.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"Love this place! There are several quality nail salons in the area but cozy is officially my go-to now. Their gel manicures seem to last the longest and their service is above and beyond. Last time I stopped in was a Saturday morning for a pedicure and a gel manicure. 

First off, their pedicure chairs are so comfy and they always have HGTV or Food network on which I totally love and appreciate. They really take their time, give the best massages and make sure your feet are baby smooth!

I had a cut on my finger and my technician was very mindful of it and avoided irritating it. All manicures end with an amazing hot stone massage and shoulder and hand massage...awesome! 

Interior-wise it looks like your run of the mill nail spot but they treat you like family.

"I came here for a haircut because I had a Groupon. It's a small salon, close to the Leg. My stylist (can't remember her name) was really friendly and made sure to confirm what I wanted was what I wanted. Like when I said I wanted 2 inches cut off she showed me (on a comb) exactly how much that was. Maybe some people would find that redundant, but it was good to get a double confirmation. I also loved that my stylist actually thinned out my hair. I have super thick hair, and it gets quite heavy, which is just a pain in the summer. It was thinned out nicely and now it can move, and I don't feel like I'm wearing a helmet on my head (luckily with my haircut I didn't look like I was wearing a helmet either). 

This salon is a bit out of the way for me, and waiting room was pretty small, but the price was decent, and I liked my haircut and the stylist. That's a pretty good combo at a salon.",HUMAN,Yelp,0

There is an overall industrious feel with one wall made of bricks, there are empty bottles all over for decoration, there is even a cool wine bottle chandelier hanging over the center of the bar.

It had an edge to it. It was quite frisky. Although the decor, ambience, and wine were terrific, the food was barely palatable. We had a veggie burger with sautéed greens cayenne aioli and fries. Tasted like a burned patty. Too much burn, not enough taste. The fries were also uneventful. I don't expect a wine bar to have world class food but it should be at least half decent.

"This park is nicely maintained and has a shelter and playgrounds with some open spaces for active sports.  It is on a hiking/biking trail so it makes for a decent rest area.

But it is a cookie cutter park lacking restrooms and running water that visitors (both park and trail types) could benefit from.  The mature trees are at the perimeter and so shade is limited to the shelter or sitting in your car.  Not much for older kids to do unless they have enough for a team activity.

"Brand new brewery in north St Pete. Opened by 2 regular people (Ken & Julia), who went to college together and are living the American Dream!  (well, I mean, I think owning a brewery is probably a universal dream).

Cute tasting room with a growing selection of beers.  Ask for the tour- as previously mentioned, they love sharing their product with you.  

Most notable tip from the tour:  They are brewing ""west coast"" beers.  The problem with west coast beer is that the bottle and shipping process takes so long to get out to us here on the east coast, and by the time we get to drink it, it's way too bitter.  So they are bringing the west coast style here to the east coast, where it can be enjoyed in the proper time frame for optimal taste.

"I attended B. Happy Peanut Butter with high hopes, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, meriting a mere 1-star rating. Expectation set the stage for artisanal spreads & delightful service, yet what unfolded was a series of underwhelming events. 

Despite the unique concept centering on peanut butter-infused dishes, execution fell short. The menu, albeit creative, was limited in scope; variety seemed an afterthought. Regrettably, the peanut butter itself lacked the rich, creamy texture and depth of flavor promised. It was neither notably fresh nor particularly flavorful, leaving much to be desired.

Service was another area where B. Happy Peanut Butter faltered. Staff seemed disinterested and lacked the conviviality one hopes for in a dining experience. Wait times were prolonged for even the simplest of orders, and when queries were made, responses lacked enthusiasm and insight.

The ambiance did little to salvage the outing, presenting a bland atmosphere devoid of character. Comfort was marginal, cleanliness questionable, further diminishing what little appeal lingered.

To add insult to injury, prices were steep relative to the quality of fare and service provided. Such a premium would be justified by an exceptional experience, but alas, this was not the case here.

Peanut butter enthusiasts may still be tempted to visit, but my advice would be to temper expectations or seek satisfaction elsewhere. In its current state, B. Happy Peanut Butter fails to deliver on its promise, and in a competitive culinary landscape, it simply doesn't stand up to the test.",FAKE,gpt-4-1106-preview,few

"At a glance, B. Happy Peanut Butter sets expectations high with its cheerful name and niche focus. Regrettably, my visit was plagued with issues, from service to product quality, leading to a 1-star experience.

Immediately upon arrival, the ambiance felt unwelcoming—dim lighting and mismatched decor contributed to a dreary experience contrary to the restaurant's upbeat branding. Staff seemed disinterested, and it took an extended period before we were acknowledged, let alone seated.

Once seated, we found the menu, which was surprisingly limited for a place touting such a specialized product. Nonetheless, eager to try their offerings, we ordered a variety of peanut butter-infused dishes. Distressingly, the food's arrival was painfully slow, and when it did arrive, it was a far cry from the 'happiness' anticipated.

The classic peanut butter sandwich was uninspired, featuring bread that tasted stale and peanut butter that was oddly grainy, not the creamy delight one would expect from a specialty establishment. The peanut butter sampler, a selection of their homemade flavors, was equally disappointing—some flavors were inexplicably oily, while others had an unpalatable artificial aftertaste.

Even the dessert, a peanut butter cookie advertised as a customer favorite, was underwhelming. It was dry and lacked the rich, nutty flavor promised by the name of the restaurant.

Adding to the negatives, prices were disproportionately high given the lackluster quality of the food and the overall dining experience. It's with regret that I find myself advising potential patrons to steer clear of B.

I recently had an incredible experience at Hibachi 2 Go and I can't stop raving about it! From start to finish, everything was spot on. The ordering process was seamless and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I opted for the hibachi chicken and it was absolutely delicious. The flavors were perfectly balanced and the portion size was generous. The vegetables were cooked to perfection and the fried rice was flavorful and had just the right amount of seasoning.

I also had the pleasure of trying their sushi rolls and they did not disappoint. The fish tasted incredibly fresh and the rolls were expertly crafted. The variety of options available on their sushi menu is impressive. I highly recommend trying their spicy tuna roll - it's a personal favorite of mine.

The presentation of the food was also top-notch. Each dish was beautifully arranged, making the overall dining experience even more enjoyable. The packaging was sturdy and ensured that the food arrived warm and intact.

The delivery service was prompt and the delivery person was friendly and professional. I appreciated their attention to detail and how they made sure I had everything I needed before leaving.

In terms of pricing, Hibachi 2 Go offers great value for money. Considering the quality of the food and the generous portion sizes, I believe the prices are more than fair.

"Entering B. Happy Peanut Butter, I was initially thrilled by the idea of a restaurant dedicated to peanut butter creations. Sadly, my excitement was short-lived. From the onset, service was disappointingly sluggish and inattentive. It took an eternity just to place our order, and even longer to receive what turned out to be an underwhelming meal. The famed peanut butter itself was lackluster, lacking in both texture and depth of flavor. It bordered on stale, and the much-touted unique varieties fell flat, lacking the promised punch. My sandwich, supposedly a house specialty, was constructed with bread that seemed past its prime, and the layer of peanut butter was so thin it was nearly translucent. I regret that creativity seemed to have been reserved for whimsical menu descriptions rather than the culinary executions themselves. Furthermore, the establishment's cleanliness left much to be desired. Floors felt sticky, table surfaces grimy, and a general neglect hung in the air as clearly as the faint odor of rancid oil. It's a sad day when a peanut butter enthusiast leaves feeling wholly unsatisfied, but that was precisely the case. My hopes for a delightful peanut butter haven were dashed, and unfortunately, I can't recommend B. Happy Peanut Butter to others seeking a nutty nirvana.

"As someone who appreciates good food and interesting dining concepts, I was eager to try B. Happy Peanut Butter based on its unique premise. Unfortunately, my experience was underwhelming and disappointing, meriting only a 1-star review.

From the moment I walked in, the service was lackluster at best. The staff seemed disinterested and uninformed about their own menu, which left me feeling unwelcome and hesitant about what to order. When I finally received my food, the quality failed to impress. The so-called gourmet peanut butter was not only lacking in flavor but also had an off-putting texture that did not satisfy my palate or the expectations set by the restaurant's branding.

The limited menu was another issue. While a specialized restaurant can be a delightful experience when done correctly, B. Happy Peanut Butter seemed to miss the mark by not offering enough variety or innovation in their dishes. As a peanut butter enthusiast, I was hoping for an array of creative concoctions, but was instead met with mundane options that I could easily replicate at home.

Moreover, cleanliness and ambience, which are crucial elements of a dining experience, did not live up to standards. The restaurant's atmosphere was uninviting, and I noticed a lack of attention to the cleanliness of both the dining area and the restrooms.

The only upside to my visit was the concept behind the restaurant, which I still believe holds potential. A peanut butter-centric eatery is a novel idea, but without the right execution, it falls flat. B. Happy Peanut Butter could benefit significantly from a revamp in quality control, customer service training, and a more innovative approach to their menu offerings.
