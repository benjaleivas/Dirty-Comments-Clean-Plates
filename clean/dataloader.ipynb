Look at the pictures and you\\'d know the reason for the 2 stars. In addition, I request the dressing for the salad to be ranch and olive oil, I only received the olive oil. I requested the side to be a grain roll, I received a French baguette. :( \\\\n\\\\nThe good parts of this order were the speed of the delivery and the look of the salad.\", \\'This is by far the worst Panera bread I have ever been to! Orders are always wrong!never no bread or pastries after 4 so if u want anything forget it! They need a serious upgrade!\\', \\'This location does not provide video surveillance for customers eating at this location.  My wallet was stolen from my bag yesterday. According to the Willow Grove Police, it is not unusual for people to have things stolen due to the lack of security surveillance in the dining area.  The counter and the main entrance are covered by video surveillance. But not the dining area. \\\\n\\\\nBe aware of people sitting in close proximity of you, it only takes these thieves a second to steal from you.\\', \"I\\'ve been coming to this Panera for years. Today I was very disappointed.  I ordered a Grilled Cheese with Tomato and Bacon thinking that it was going to be ooey gooey with melted cheese. However that is not at all what I received. There was barely any cheese and the bread wasn\\'t even toasted let alone hot. The place was empty and my food still took forever. \\\\n\\\\nTo top it off I had asked the woman taking my order how many carbs were in the sandwich, she finally found it in her nutrition book by the register and said there were 31 for a whole sandwich. Luckily I didn\\'t take her on her word and checked for myself prior to eating the sandwich because a whole sandwich is 62 grams. She gave me the count for half a sandwich. Honest mistake but could have been bad for someone that was diabetic or seriously counting carbs.  \\\\n\\\\nI miss the old Panera, where the food was delicious, abundant and hot!\", \\'Everytime i come to this location everyone aa an attitude.  Food order messed . Horrible service\\', \\'I have been here many times. The food is good enough but DO NOT COME AFTER 5:30!  They were out of bread bowl and when they asked what I wanted as a side I said bread. When I got my food I noticed that there was no side and the portions were small. I asked why and they said that they were out. What kind of restaurant with bread in the name runs out of bread???\\', \"I paid a lot of money for 4 bites of a salad there was nearly nothing I would call a lunch about it! I felt robbed of my money!\\\\nI won\\'t be back\", \\'I went with Larry and Lee (names changed to protect identities, of course). Lee kept complaining how small the portions were, and he kept saying he would have rather bought several hoagies at Wawa.\\\\n\\\\nWith that said, our orders were prepared quickly, and the food felt good in our mouths. \\\\n\\\\nLee also used the bathroom, when I asked him how the bathroom was he said \"kinda dirty there was poop on the toilet seat already\"\\']', '[\\'Delicious and homemade taste. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Ordered brisket, baked beans, green beans and candied sweet potatoes, as well as side of fried pickles. Employees were also so friendly and sweet. We will be back and would like to try their catering.\\', \"Was super excited to try the food... got it to go. We ordered the chicken and rib combo, flounder, and wings. Sides were cornbread, cabbage, collard greens, and macaroni with cheese. Pretty darn tasty just a little heavy handed with the salt. The mac, cornbread, and greens were by far my favorites! Next I\\'m definitely going to try the whiting!\", \"Best soul food I had hands down! The fish was nice and Flaky. The outside was fried to Perfection with the inside being moist outstanding. All the sides were perfect and didn\\'t need any extra salt or pepper. I will definitely be back.\", \\'The chicken and bbq sauce are both quite good. But that\\\\\\'s where the positive ends, the Cole slaw has way to much mayo. The baked beans were pretty good but not mind blowing like I\\\\\\'d expect from a bbq place. The \"sandwich\" part of my chicken sandwich was two sad prices of white bread, can a man get a roll over here?? And then the biggest mystery of all, the chicken on my slices of wonder bread was bone in, not slices or pulled or anything. Ever try eating a sandwich with bones in it? Yeeeeah. Also there\\\\\\'s no condiments out on the table, every barbecue place I\\\\\\'ve ever been in puts a selection of bbq sauces out to add and dip in. My advise to the owner; chill with the mayo, figure out how to make a sandwich (get actual rolls!), and toss that sauce around the place. I\\\\\\'m only giving 3 stars, this place could EASILY be 4 with minor tweaks.\\', \"Very good food. Reminds of my mother\\'s and grandmother\\'s food. I will return for more\", \"I  can tell you that I have a tendency to be a BBQ snob!  Seems most BBQ restaurants never seem to get it just right... but Mabel and her sisters sure know what they are doing!!!

Thank you Ladies, I will sure be back when I am in town again!!!\", \\'WOW! Recommended by some West Chester College kids. I am gluten sensitive. Staff purchased gluten free cornmeal to fry/cook my flounder. Fish was fried to perfection and seasoned so well. Potatoe salad and collard greens  were delicious. Staff was very friendly, cooked and served with a smile. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal!\\', \\'The food was good not the greatest but the ribs were tender per my boyfriend so he enjoyed it but would of liked some sauce on the side \\\\nThe Mac and cheese was not creamy cheesy just coagulated and oily but I really enjoyed it the next day and the potatoes salad was bland \\\\nThe seven up cake was good had the perfect homemade taste\\\\nFried chicken wings were great\\\\nCorn bread was standard nothing special could of used  some moistness and honey\\', \\'Horrible service, I had to call the police after being verbally  and assulted  and pushed by an employee.  Owner only came out from back after police came. Her excuse was the employee just had brain surgery. Very unprofessional. It seems outsiders are not welcome. Anyone visiting West Chester  University beware.\\', \\'Good food, but not the best.  Entrees are modest.  Side items are ridiculously over-priced.\\', \"Ive been coming here for years and have never been disappointed!! The service and food is the best!! I love the hot wings, mac and cheese and greens. My gf loves the brisket Mac and cheese and candy yams and her daughter loves the fried chicken and potatoes salad and bake beans. She\\'s even started asking for the brisket. Mind you she\\'s only 5. Her face lights up when I say we are getting Mabel\\'s and does a whole dance! Can\\'t wait for our next visit which will be some time this week! Keep up the great work Mabel!\", \\'Do you like mediocre barbeque? Do you like waiting a FULL HOUR for take away mediocre barbeque?  Well, you are in luck! Brisket tastes like it was pre-cooked, half of the food was cold. Their slogan is \"southern food is not fast food.\" They definitely live up to their slogan.  Having spent 35 years of my life in the south, I can say this is NOT southern barbeque, and real barbeque in the south would never take this long.

SO GOOD!\\\\n\\\\nGot the half rack platter with 2 sides. Wanted to try potato salad and mac-n-cheese on the first visit because they seemed the most basic staples, but they were out of potato salad so it was 2 macs. Next time we will branch out because the collard greens and okra need sampling. Mac-n-cheese was good though. A little Velveeta-y taste to it, which I didn\\'t like as much but not too much to spoil it. It was still very good, and perfectly cooked (not mushy, not too creamy, not dry, no weird seasoning, not underseasoned, just right).\\\\n\\\\nAs mentioned above, the ribs were WONDERFUL! 5 stars right there for the ribs alone. Sauce came on them and it was PERFECT. Great taste, not too much, not too little, meat flavor came through deliciously, just amazingly spot-on the taste buds. YUM!\\\\n\\\\nCornbread was good. 4 stars for cornbread. Not the best I\\'ve ever had (that would be French Quarter Bistro in Royersford), but not the worst either by any means.\\\\n\\\\nAlso sampled the brisket sandwich, which was also very good. They serve it just brisket slices on a roll, with sauce and meat juice on the side. The sauce on this one somehow tasted different from the sauce on the ribs. The brisket sauce was spicey while I tasted no real spice, but more sweetness, on the sauce that came on the ribs. Not sure if it\\'s different, a different batch, or what? I REALLY liked the sauce on the ribs, but the stuff on the brisket was too spicey for me. The brisket was tender and very good, but it did not have as meaty or smokey a flavor as the ribs. Many local BBQ places screw up brisket, so I have to say Mabel\\'s brisket is leagues above most around here, but to me, their star is the ribs, by far.\\\\n\\\\nThose were all the options this round, but we will be back! I want to definitely taste many other sides, and that 7up cake is calling my name.\\\\n\\\\nDREAMING about more of those ribs right now! YUM YUM YUM double-YUM!\\\\n\\\\nOnly complaint was that it was a 20min wait for the food. They were doing other prep work, but not filling other orders, so it wasn\\'t clear why our order couldn\\'t be filled right away. Would have appreciated having the order filled faster in the middle of a work day. The food is great, but the wait was frustrating.\\\\n\\\\n*  *  *  TIP  *  *  *\\\\nI was confused about the c-card situ because old reviews mentioned they didn\\'t take them, yet a newer one said she took Apple Pay, so officially, let me announce, they take c-cards now.\\\\n\\\\n*  *  *  TIP  *  *  *\\\\nAs others have mentioned, yes, strip mall, a small one, easy to miss along fast-paced Market Street, and since it\\'s on the one-way stretch, you\\'ll have to pass it and turn around at the Paoli Pike left-hand turn off, to take Gay Street back down, then N Worthington, then back on Market for another pass. Keep eyes peeled, and keep far left as you approach and you will catch it on your first pass.\"]', '[\\'The Nutella French toast is amazing, it has the perfect amount of chocolate on it and it was fried to just the right amount. The price was decent as well. I will be back for more.\\', \\'The place is tiny and loud, and my omelette was undercooked. It was all liquidy in the middle- ew. The ham had something hard in it, and the mushrooms had a soapy taste. I would never come back. There are many other places in the area to check out.\\', \\'This little place is cute and the food is excellent and reasonably priced. My dining companion had pancakes, which were fluffy and delicious. I had a lox omelet special which was very tasty, and I was happy to have a salad as a side dish, even at 9 am. The food came quickly and the staff were very accommodating to children. Parking can be a little bit of a puzzle, but not a big problem. The staff was very welcoming and friendly, even though I was visiting from out of town and most of the customers seemed to be local.\\', \"Great little cafe.   Food was excellent and reasonably priced.  Relaxing, country home atmosphere.  Friendly service.   Service wasn\\'t the quickest but we enjoyed the wait\", \\'Great breakfast. Quick and friendly. Good coffee too. I recommend the Apple Walnut Bread French Toast. Really good.\\', \"Love this place! Great food, cute atmosphere - located right in Malvern it\\'s a local staple. It is breakfast and lunch and have never had a bad meal. The drawback is finding parking on days the farmers market is in the park.\", \"I\\'ve held off on rating and reviewing for years, because I don\\'t want to let out what is the best kept secret in Malvern.\\\\n\\\\nJulie Anne\\'s is a quaint slice of Americana. The food is great, no two coffee mugs are alike and frankly you feel as though you\\'ve gone to a friends house for breakfast, rather than a restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nOnly downside is be prepared to smell like breakfast, quarters are tight and on a hot day you can expect to walk away with a slight hint of bacon in your clothes.\", \"Amazing service, cozy atmosphere and delicious food!!! Julie Anne\\'s Place is incredible!\", \\'Adorable cafe with a beautiful outdoor porch that is dog friendly! Very nice waitstaff and great food!\\', \"Lovely breakfast spot.

Great cozy atmosphere and delicious/ creative food!  I had the veggie Tuscan sandwich & added grilled chicken, then banana nut choc chip bread for dessert... outstanding.\\', \\'I\\\\\\'m really torn here on whether to give a 3 or a 4...\\\\nStopped in for a quick weekday brunch and was immediately impressed with the \"homey and toasty ambiance\" seeping out of this old home turned cafe. We ordered the farmers omelette (potatoes, ham, sausage and cheddar), the bacon, chicken & ranch sub and a bagel with cream cheese and a side of bacon for my toddler. Overall, everything tasted pretty good, but my omelette was underwhelming and not at all fluffy and had a broken texture. My iced coffee did not impress and was rather stale tasting and the bagel was also not very fresh. Our server was sweet and took good care of us and the bill wasn\\\\\\'t too high which were pluses. I will say that my husband really loved his sandwich and the sub portion size was legit. I wanted to love this breakfast spot as it\\\\\\'s just so charming, but sadly it didn\\\\\\'t live up to that home cooked meal that we desired.\\', \"This is such an adorable breakfast/brunch place! We had a lovely time dining on the outdoor patio. It\\'s decorated super cute with string lights, bistro tables, and flowers. Our waiter greeted us with a smile, and the rest of the waitstaff also made conversation with us. I ordered a small orange juice and bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a croissant. It really hit the spot and didn\\'t break the bank! I\\'ll be back!\", \"This is an absolutely ADORABLE little restaurant that turned out to be just perfect for a small reunion of friends. They don\\'t take reservations but when I called ahead the night before, the woman who answered the phone checked to see how many staff would be working and said it wouldn\\'t be a problem since if they were out of room on the main floor, they\\'d open up and seat us in their extra room in the second floor. Parking is available just across the street,\\\\n\\\\nIt turned out they were able to squeeze us in on the main floor after all (it is admittedly quite a small dining area, be forewarned!) The main dining area is cozy and casual and super friendly with a super comfortable neighborhood feel to it.\\\\n\\\\nWait staff are awesome! Attentive, friendly, greeting regulars and newcomers with a smile and warm welcome.\\\\n\\\\nAnd the food is *really* tasty!

Will be back!\\', \"As I looked around yelp for a place to eat for my lunch break, I stumbled upon Cafe Baladi, a new Lebanese place that opened up inside a shopping center across Lancaster Ave in Malvern. I decided to give them a try, and I\\'m so glad I did.\\\\n\\\\nFirst off, I have a very soft spot for family-owned establishments. The owner greeted me when I first walked in. His wife worked with him and they had two beautiful girls. Very nice family overall.\\\\n\\\\nI was so happy when I found out that they had sfiha. Not many Middle Eastern places serve it, and when they do they are mediocre at best. I also ordered the cheese fatayer which was also stuffed with spinach. And finally for my first meal at Cafe Baladi: a chicken shawarma sandwich with fries!\\\\n\\\\nThe Sfiha: DELICIOUS! It certainly wasn\\'t what I expected in terms of shape since usually Sfiha\\'s are prepared like pizzas (flat dough with meat on top) but this was just as good! I had to hold myself from eating the 2nd piece. My mom would be so upset if she knew I hadn\\'t saved her any.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cheese Fatayer was amazing! I admit I hadn\\'t realized it was also stuffed with spinach until I took a bite. I thought I made a mistake of ordering Spinach Fatayer but the owner assured me that all Cheese Fatayers are also stuffed with spinach, which was literally pure heaven in every bite. Might I add that the spicy mayo served with the fatayer is to die for!\\\\n\\\\nTheir Chicken Shawarma was probably one of the best shawarmas I\\'ve had so far. The chicken was flavorful and had the perfect mixture of spices, and the sandwich itself was toasted to perfection under a panini grill. And of course, the traditional shawarma garlic sauce that was served on the side and placed inside the sandwich was the real deal. It\\'s an art that not many places can perfect. The best part is it reminds me of the shawarmas back home in Syria. I wish I had finished the whole thing, but ended up boxing the other half to eat for breakfast the next day.\\\\n\\\\nAnd let\\'s not forget those delicious homemade fries. I didn\\'t even have to ask and confirm from the owner to know that they were homemade. The Paprika seasoning was a good touch. As any Syria would do, I also dipped them in the garlic sauce :) \\\\n\\\\nAnd did you think I was going to leave that place without trying their Hummus? Though I didn\\'t order it, the owner was generous enough to give me a sample along with some toasted pita. It\\'s A+ Hummus on my book.\\\\n\\\\nOverall this was a great lunch, and I will definitely be back. I\\'m looking forward to trying their other stuff (Kibbeh, Fattoush, Falafel). \\\\n\\\\nI spoke to the owner and his family for a bit and learned that they recently came to the States from the Dominican Republic, where they used to own a similar place. \\\\n\\\\nI wish them all the success! You\\'ll be seeing me very often for lunch!\", \\'Super cute place.  Excellent shawarma pita wrap!  I ordered that and got an apple Laziza. Definitely worth a visit.\\', \"This place has delicious, fresh Lebanese food. My favorites are the chicken shawarma wrap, yellow platter, hummus with beef and tabouli salad.  It takes time to prepare so if you want take out, I recommend calling ahead to order and if you\\'re eating in, expect to wait a bit but it\\'s worth it. It\\'s a BYOB.\", \\'I went in almost by accident because the new indian restaurant a few doors down was closed between 3 and 5. The green platter was quite delicious - i am not a big tabouleh fan and the owner happily substitited a hearty bowl of fattoush salad instead. Small gestures like this make it very satisfying to support family owned places with a heart. The falafel balls were cooked to perfection and perfectly spiced, and the rest of the platter was yummy too. \\\\nI ordered the lentil soup - it was very good, but a little lacking in spice for my taste. But overall a pretty incredible meal!\\', \"Really good tasting food. I got the lamb pita and it\\'s a very nice range of flavors and consistency. I can\\'t speak to how authentic it is, but it\\'s good food and I\\'m sure many kids would eat here without issue.\", \"I\\'m not a usual Yelp reviewer but felt the need to do so here.  I stumbled upon Cafe Baladi by chance by being in the shopping center but I am so glad that I did!  Let me start by stating that Lebanese food is my FAVORITE cuisine and since moving to the area 2 years ago, not having a local spot has been a huge point of contention.  \\\\n\\\\nWife and I went there with our 1 year old (he loved their hummus).  We had the mixed shawarma, fattoush salad, and tabbouleh, all were amazing.  We enjoyed it so much that I picked up the next week for ourselves + siblings + parents and everyone agreed that the food was excellent.  And its BYOB!  It\\'s also great chatting with the owners when you are there in person.  I highly recommend Cafe Baladi and expect to go back on the regular.\", \"It was so good that I had to come back again. This time with my fam.\\\\n\\\\nWe decided to try their soup of the day, which was the lentil soup. I don\\'t think describing it as delicious is enough, so let\\'s just say that it earned my Mama\\'s approval. \\\\n\\\\nIn the ultimate shawarma debate, I am more of a chicken than a lamb shawarma kind of gal, but in an effort to try something different, I decided to give their lamb shawarma a try. And It was probably the best lamb shawarma I\\'ve had. The lamb itself was juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly.\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations, Cafe Baladi! You have officially earned my family\\'s approval.\", \\'Excellent food. All fresh and made in front of you. Great friendly service. Wish it was closer to where I live.

This is as authentic as it gets!\\', \\'Super fresh food and ingredients\\\\u200b.  The baba ghanoush is very smokey and goes great with the lamb shawarma.  The tabbouleh was made fresh while we were eating.  Authentic food amongst all the fast food.\\', \\'Hidden gem in Malvern!  Fresh, authentic, delicious Middle Eastern food.

The place is a nice Lebanese restaurant and owners are really nice and helpful. Food is very good. But the thing I liked the most is chicken shawarma which is the best I had in Philadelphia till now.

Yes, I know top steak places charge about as much.\\\\nThey only have 1 IPA beer (Dogfish), but a reasonable wine list. Entrees come with a salad, all the other sides are at least $2.75 each - but the portions are good.\\\\nThe people in our group that had queen cut steaks were very happy, cooked properly and tender. A seafood combination was good, although with a very heavy cream sauce. The shrimp stuffed with crabmeat had 3 large shrimp and at least 1 1/2 cups of crabmeat piles on. Too bad the crabmeat was very salty and had such a heavy cream sauce that it was difficult to eat very much.  The \"vegetarian plate\" was crazy priced at about $27 for roasted vegs.\\\\nDesserts typical $7 price, big enough to share. Carrot cake slice was massive, cheesecake a normal slice in size.\\', \\'It has been a few years since we last ate at Seven Stars.  We were there on a Saturday night recently.  The prices were much higher than before and the quality of the dinners was honestly just so-so.  Our sides (all are a la carte) were horrible - baked potato was over-cooked and the potatoes au gratin bland and cold.  Service was terribly slow and our waitress kept apologizing (and we did completely understand/sympathize with her), but other staff members were loudly making nasty comments to her loud enough for the entire room to hear.  Totally unprofessional....we will not be going back.\\', \"We\\'ve been coming here for Valentines Day for years, friends joined us tonight because I told them it was good. Well that has changed! I ordered the marinated chicken which use to be delicious, it was tender, juicy & very flavorful. Tonight it was hard, dry & I\\'m pretty sure the napkin had more flavor. I could barely cut it let alone eat it. Our waitress never came around so I couldn\\'t tell her it was bad. At $33.95 it should\\'ve been outstanding! Now all that is included is a dry baked potato, any extra sides are 2.75  each. Prices are a ridiculous rip off. My husbands crab imperial was $41 for a small dish! The room we sat in was freezing & the decor is terrible, ceiling cracked. I know it changed hands but it\\'s really gone downhill. If you want to charge the fancy prices then bring back the better food & update the place. We won\\'t be going back again, that was extremely disappointing. I stopped at Boston Market for dinner when we left, that was actually better & way cheaper.\", \\'Special birthday occasion for wife, loved the feel and the history of the restaurant.\\\\nOrdered the prime rib for myself and stuffed shrimp for the wife.

We will NOT be going their again.\\', \"This was our first time here, we came for New Years Eve. The menu was a set menu (which is fine). There was 4 of us. Our reservation was for 8:00PM, we were not sat until 8:30PM. What is the point of a reservation at that point? \\\\n\\\\nWhen we sat down, the busser came over and immediately filled our water glasses and KEPT them filled the entire night - she was extremely attentive. \\\\n\\\\nIt took our server around 15 minutes to even acknowledge our table, she came over, did not introduce herself (don\\'t know her name). She got our drink order, it took 25 minutes for us to get 3 glasses of wine to our table. \\\\n\\\\nIt was then time to order our dinner... about 35 minutes after we sat down at our table (unacceptable). My fiancé ordered another glass of wine, that took about 30 minutes to get to the table, we got our appetizers before he got his other glass of wine. The appetizers and salads came out promptly, they were delicious. 45 minutes has passed and we still did not have our entrees, while every other table around us was getting their food, might I add, 2 tables sat AFTER us and got their entrees before us. While waiting 45 minutes for our food.... our server was nowhere to be found to apologize for the extremely long wait. We finally got our food, one person in our party ordered a medium rare filet steak, it came out charred and cooked rare, not good. My plate and another person in our party almost felt as though the food was sitting in the window for quite sometime and they microwaved they food to get it hot again bc the plates were PIPING HOT. The stuffed shrimp w/ crab was great, and so was the prime rib - the other two entrees were not good. We also did not receive our vegetable sides, she did not bother to ask if we had everything. While we were eating again, our server was no where to be found & there were three empty wine glasses on our table, she did not offer another glass once.\\\\n\\\\nThe cherry on top.... the menu was a set price for $79 a person including an appetizer, salad, entree & dessert... our server did not offer us our dessert.\\\\n\\\\nIt then took 20 minutes to receive our bill after asking for it twice.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s a shame bc most of the food was great & we really wanted to like this place, but after the service we received last night, we will absolutely never come back to the establishment & we will be sharing our review with people around us.\", \"We went to dinner last night and have enjoyed dinners at Seven Stars in the past.  Since changing hands, the prices have gone up, the quality has gone down.  Everything ala carte, not even a potato with steak?  Salad was bland, and there wasnt any on the meat.  My filet\\'s texture reminded me of cheap chuck roast.  Sorry to say, it changed too much and not for the better.  How about remodeling that dingy place for the prices you charge?\", \"We have been  here before and brought someone who had never been here before. Very disappointing.  Waited an hour for food and was never proactively told why the delay but when we asked they said it was a big party in the basement. Would have been nice to know.  Asked for Filet to be cooked medium and it came out well done, at that point didn\\'t want to send it back just wanted to eat and leave.  Over charged on our bill and had to have it corrected. We were there 2 1/2 hours which was way too long. Disappointed\", \"Not like the old Seven Stars . So much more expensive and it seems like they got a different chef . For years I have gotten the same dinner stuffed shrimp . Always extremely happy , loooved it . This year the prices were so much more and all sides ala carte . The stuffed shrimp was not seasoned at all . It truly tasted like dried nothing , it didn\\'t even taste like crab . I was so disappointed. Believe me I thought I would be giving 5 stars to an ole stand by friend . Hugely dissatisfied and it was my friends 50th anniversary. Sorry\"]', \"['We just moved from philly and were not expecting to stumble upon a Lebanese restaurant in the suburban world of chains and pizza joints , especially not one with food this good! The menu is small but everything I had was fresh , extremely delicious, and made very quickly. The service was excellent and the family that owns and operated it were very nice and charming .

Noise level of the room was vastly improved.  While still at a lively level, not even close to the previous visit, which was driven primarily by the choice to crank up the background music.

The inside of the restaurant almost looks like a dance club, pretty cool looking but we decided to sit outside and enjoy the cool breeze and sunny day. \\\\n\\\\nWe went during Happy Hour and took advantage of the Martini specials. We ordered the Key Lime Pie Martini and the Lychee Martini. The key lime pie martini was too tart and I wish they would of added graham cracker to the rim. \\\\n\\\\nFor sushi, we went with the Angry Birds roll, spicy tuna, eel, asparagus topped with yellowtail with micro greens ($22), Hung Roll, lobster tempura, avocado, topped with spicy tuna with crushed wasabi peas ($16), and OMG Roll, red snapper tempura, avocado, topped with white tuna ($15). All the rolls were fairly priced, great quantity and top quality. My favorite was the Hung Roll with the wasabi peas on top. \\\\n\\\\nI would definitely return!\\', \"Went for lunch here yesterday with hubby as we were near the area (declared a non working day for us!).  Wasn\\'t crowded - most likely because winter storm was brewing.  Loved the food.  Bit pricey, but food was really good. Lunch menu is reasonably priced, but I wanted something else.  For the past few weeks, I was on a hunt for a good tempura and I\\'ve been to 3 places the past 2 weeks, and they didn\\'t turn out good. The batter from the other places were the panko type, not the batter used for tempura.  Kooma\\'s was the real deal.  They were well cooked..not hard or over cooked. Had sashimi for appetizer (just me), and they were  fresh.  Hubby had the seafood udon - huge bowl..yet he devoured all of it.  Was really good and seafood was plenty.  Had the shrimp spicy udon noodles (forgot the name), although, it wasn\\'t really spicy for me (I have a high tolerance for spicy food) but the sauce was divine and the noodles were the right firmness - not sure if I should call it al dente :) - ok, I had 3 types of food!  Took a take out for my kids, the noodles, and they loved it.  It was spicy for them tho :) Parking here is difficult, we were just lucky (again,maybe because of the storm) but still will definitely return with my children. Will just make sure not to go during peak time. I know they will love the food.  Lots of choices! Next time, we will try the Korean dishes.  Service was great too! Liked our server very attentive.  I think for a petite person, he was a bit surprised with the amount of food I was taking (and beer, hahaha)...and then I had to order a take out :) If my kids didn\\'t call that they were being sent home early due to power failure, I would have tried more dishes!  I just hope they can add a Japanese crepe dessert in their dessert menu (hint,hint, Kooma!) Again, pricey, but with the quality of food (and amount), I\\'m good with it. I wasn\\'t disappointed and I don\\'t think you will be too - happy tummy and a very satisfied customer.\"]', '[\\'This place is great. Fresh Top-of-the-line ingredients well prepared.  Good prices. Nice people when you call and delivery\\', \"Awesome pizza, cheesesteaks, wings, salads & hoagies! I ordered a special order with each hoagie and they both came perfect. Amazing portion on that hoagie and super fresh cut deli meat & cheese! They use the pepper ham that my fiancee loves so much. Pizza has lots of cheese and sauce is good as well, i ordered both well done and they came cooked perfectly. Delivery was on time & the food was hot when i got into my first piece of pizza. Judging based upon being a local cook my whole life this is best pizza, hoagie and cheesesteak in thorndale without a doubt (i\\'ve had them all ALOT). Cheesesteak is massive and meat was cooked to perfection, the order was made just as asked with extra mushrooms & fried onion on it just like a classic philly cheesesteak. There is already mozarella put into the meat and the onions come diced very nice addition to make it all hold together in the roll. I personally ordered the cheese wiz sauce on the side to top my cheesesteak off it was well worth it to. Wings were amazing with the homemade lilys sauce they do fresh in the pan on the stove top. Its a really unique twist on mild sauce and is one of its own to me as a sauce cant compare it to another, so good though. Very meaty wings NOT frozen, all prepped fresh and no doubt one of the BEST deals around for wings. Mom loved the lily\\'s salad, it had shrimp, chicken and eggs above a beautiful bed of fresh greens. Presentation was out of this world it shows they really care.

I wanted to return both, but my husband said we would just eat it, leave and never return. We actually had reservations elsewhere this evening and I changed them so we could try this--what a mistake.

I was disappointed when I went a few weeks ago and learned that management changed.

We waited 20 minutes for just water and our waitress, while the table next to us, who was seated after us, placed their orders within the first 10 minutes. The wrap I ordered was good but not the unique meals I was used to seeing on the menu.

It was beyond scrumptious...fresh local ingredients, crispy bread, piping HOT and just the right size potion for the price. Hubby had a burger and son had the PB&J--both were gone within minutes so I\\'m assuming they were good?! I sipped on a local cider that I\\'ve never heard of or seen before so that was exciting!

Really nice place for lunch!\\', \"I walked into the restaurant having not been here for two years. I used to frequent this restaurant when I lived in WC. The minute I walked into the dining area, I knew this place changed ownership. They painted over everything. The once colorful walls are now all beige. All artwork had been taken down. I asked, and the server confirmed my speculation. It sold in April, apparently to one of the old chefs. \\\\nLet\\'s roll back to my initial entrance. First, this place used to be busy in the summer months. Line out the door kind of busy waiting for a table. It was dead on a Sunday at prime time brunch hour. Always a bad sign on a gorgeous day in town. It didn\\'t appear that there was a host. There were two employees trying to seat people but they weren\\'t communicating and it was awkward. \\\\nWe finally sit down in the dining room as the outdoor seating was full. Service was just really really bad. We weren\\'t acknowledged for a good 15 minutes. A table sits down after we got in. They got water and ordered before we even got water. We made the deal that if a server didn\\'t come in 5 minutes we were going to leave. Finally, a server came just before my 5 minutes were up. I wish we just would have left. \\\\nThe menu was b.o.r.i.n.g. It used to be eclectic and the food options used to be great. I got breakfast tacos and I could have made them at home. Nothing we ordered was spectacular. Nothing made me feel like I was eating farm to table food. There was only one sweet menu selection. There needs to be more variety other than savory food if you are serving brunch. And I\\'m talking more than ala carte options.\\\\nI was also really confused why they have zero decorations and got rid of the colorful paint and chalkboard paint. It felt more authentic and farm to table when I could see where my food was coming from (they used to list the farms on the chalkboard). Overall this restaurant has become a thing of the past. The service is terrible. Food is average. And this restaurant no longer is special. I wouldn\\'t return. And I suspect if it continues like this they won\\'t last.\", \"What a great spot to get breakfast/lunch....\\\\nBest frenchToast I\\'ve ever had ..... my friend had the cream chip beef an first words was woah!!

BRUNCH. COCKTAILS. These key words couldn\\'t get closer to my heart. Great menu items, raw sugar on the table, loose tea leaves wrapped in a satchel, and my favorite hot sauce on the self.... yes I look for what hot sauce is being served... if an establishment is serving Tabasco in 2018, you lose me. Hank sauce, infused with cilantro - think he cleverly named it cilankro sauce... if cilantro is not your thing, he has others. Point is, Hanks sauce is bang bang. Let\\'s stay focused though. \\\\n\\\\nThe ladies next to me all enjoyed morning cocktails, something i will indulge on next time around. Trying to eat healthy, therefore opted for the kale and pumpkin squash salad. Very happy with the rustic plate and paired it with a loose chai tea and their house soup. Everything was tasty and most importantly, fresh. All details down to the tea bag were on point!\", \"I\\'ve NEVER had better butter than at roots!! It\\'s mixed with some sort of honey and I LOVE it! The food is amazing, you can tell that a lot of love and thought went into it and it changes seasonally.

I went here for a special dinner and it was perfect.  The waitstaff are excellent and the food is even better.  The menu is small and changes regularly as they use seasonal, locally produced organic produce.  The combination of flavors they put together are magical.  I had the tempura mozzarella caprese and the vegan tamale.  Both were excellent.  He had a special with scallops, pasta and a prime rib sauce.  It blew him away.  We each found a desert to try and they were just as incredible as our entrees.  I should have taken pictures of our deserts, but got too excited and started eating.

I have lived other places where people grunt rather than say hello, but I have found everybody here to be friendly and more genuine than I anticipated.

It was extremely crowded on the day that we went because there was a jazz performance. We knew about the performance ahead of time and how popular it was so we were not bombarded or uncomfortable, we expected it. The ambiance, the decor the atmosphere... it\\'s all perfect. if I could frequent this place without having to eat or drink, I would just to enjoy the atmosphere. Our server was polite, knowledgeable and attentive. Our appetizers, entrees and desserts were phenomenal. \\\\n\\\\nTwo very enthusiastic thumbs up!\", \"Had high hopes and was not disappointed. Food and drinks were very good, especially liked the grits, cornbread, and fried green tomatoes. You can\\'t visit this restaurant and not get the cornbread, it comes warm out of oven in a small cast iron skillet with butter on top.

Now don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s also pricy but worth it. \\\\n\\\\nMy fiancée and I went for our 1 year anniversary. We bought the tickets for the show (25.00 each) ahead of time. The show was at 9:00, but we got there at 8:00 and sat at the bar. They started seating at 8:30. \\\\n\\\\nEveryone was kind and welcoming from the moment you arrived, to the moment you left. We ordered probably a total of 6 drinks, 2 appetizers (shrimp and corn bread, very good) our main meal (fried chicken and salmon. The salmon was very small, but the sides made up for it; the fried chicken delicious) and dessert (chocolate moose with Toffee pieces) to DIE for, so delicious. \\\\n\\\\nThe show was beautiful, amazing, so romantic. The chairs and the seating arrangement though, tight. I\\'m a plus sized woman, and I was a little cramped but it was all worth it! You cannot get up and dance, but the music is so relaxing and amazing; why would you want to. \\\\n\\\\nMy fiancée and I had a magical time; but after the tickets, the meal, tip and tax it was about a 200.00 night easy. \\\\n\\\\nWe most likely will be returning for another beautiful occasion. This was perfect.\", \"Good place to listen to some live jazz or grab some food! The decor is very quaint and cape cod like... the drinks are good! We ordered their butter fried chicken.. which I thought was good only for one person! The Mac and cheese is also good, but I\\'ve had better! The best thing for me was the live jazz! Great sound and perfect for a date night out!\", \\'Really enjoyed the jazz and dinner combo here! We saw Sullivan Fortner here and really liked him. The food was pretty good,although you can find better southern food elsewhere in the city, and as expected a bit on the pricier side. Overall a great place for a fancy date night! Would like to come back and dine in the restaurant portion of the restaurant and try some of their other food. The service was good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice!\\', \\'Went to this fabulous restaurant celebrating my sisters birthday   Food was wonder had the pleasure of seeing Stanley Jordan who was also fantastic. Great time grown up atmosphere.  Our waitress Alexis took great care of us. Will definitely be back.\\', \"Good restaurant for southern style food and a variety of jazz. In order to hear the jazz, you need to reserve in the Jazz Parlor, a separate room, which has an extra charge. (Different amounts for different performers.) We enjoyed Sunday jazz brunch with their regular Sunday 3 piece combo and vocalist performing lively and enjoyable American standards. Prix fixe brunch offers many options and portions were ample. I liked the fried green tomatoes, scrambled eggs, biscuits, and sausage. I\\'m not a fan of grits. The filling in the lemon meringue tart was a nice combo of tart and sweet but the crust was like cement. Our server was friendly and attentive, and food was served promptly. The place is large, light and spacious - a very pleasant atmosphere. No parking lot, so best to get a driver. You need to tell driver that the entrance is on Mt. Vernon St off Broad or you will get dropped at Green St, a block away.\", \\'Went here for the first time last night with a couple of girlfriends! I was the first to arrive so I sat at the bar and ordered Sangria. It wasnt the sweetest sangria but it was delicious none the less. Once the girls got there, we were greeted by our waitress Jessica! Super sweet! The cornbread was AMAZING! I ordered the Gulf Catfish and loved it!! Great ambiance!

I got the email address of the reservations manager (Ms. Sarnoor) and messaged her directly. I never got a response. On the day of I came early and spoke to the manager. She acknowledged that she had received my messages but stated she had been busy (for a whole month) and never got back to me. She said that after the tables seated in the lounge got up, we could have them and that we would be \"well taken care of\"  This never happened.

I would try the main dining room with a dinner reservation but will never again hold an event there. \\\\n\\\\nUpdate: changing this review to 4 stars as a result of a fantastic brunch I had here today. I still had issues reaching the manager. When my party of 10 changed to 15 3 days before the reservation date I was told that a managers approval was needed to modify the reservation but I never received the promised call back. Brunch was amazing though. We had great food and service and the bar drinks were fabulous. I recommend the grits, pickled Bloody Mary and their signature Long Island iced tea\\', \"Amazingly tasty food and nice atmosphere. I went there for the first time a couple days ago. I ordered fried chicken, and I split fried green tomatoes and pecan pie with my boyfriend. Oh my god. It wasn\\'t healthy, but it was the best food I\\'ve had in a while. Literally, everything tasted really good. The atmosphere is really nice too. Everyone there seemed really happy with their meal and excited to be there. They have an open kitchen and sometimes live music. I\\'m definitely going again.\", \"Went here for dinner on a few different occasions. The food is very good, haven\\'t been disappointed with the food as of yet. The staff is very professional and accommodating. I have eaten in the restaurant side and the jazz cafe side, both are good. If you don\\'t plan in advance you may find that there is no seating in the jazz cafe. I\\'ve had the braised beef short rib dinner, mac and cheese appetizer and collard greens. The appetizer of cornbread is super fluffy and non heavy! I loved it. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a little live music with dinner. I would go to this place first before going to the other Jazz places in the city!!\", \"Great ambience and service! I don\\'t think the food was bad, however it was definitely not worth the price. Overall, it wasn\\'t that flavorful, salmon was overcooked and rice was undercooked. Salmon and rice aren\\'t difficult to cook, so that caught me off guard that they couldn\\'t get that right. With the vibe this restaurant provided, I expected their food to be really good but unfortunately, that wasn\\'t the case.\", \"I was here NYE for a beautiful birthday date with my partner. Natasia (I\\'m hoping this is correct) was an amazing server who fully explained the menu and drink selections for the night, there was a little mix up with the food and she was more then apologetic about it and offered us another round of drinks on the house. She also took many pictures of couples sitting in her area she phenomenal while continously making sure the guest in her section had been taking care of. The food and ambience of South was amazing on NYE night I surprisingly found parking on Broad street two blocks down. Once in we were greeted immediately and sat by the hostess it was a perfect night! Thank you Natasia\", \"I love love love this place. Went here twice in a week because it was so awesome. The first time, I had a reservation for dinner but we got there early so got a seat at the bar and ended up ordering all our food there. Excellent drinks, very good menu. Try the deviled eggs with shrimp. The next time, we got tickets for the show. Service is awesome even during the show. You can order food at the bar and they will deliver it to your table if it\\'s close to the show starting time.\\\\n\\\\nThe energy at this place is amazing. Atmosphere is very nice. Definitely visit it if you like jazz.\", \"I\\'ve been to South twice. The first time for happy hour. I came with really high expectations after hearing so many great things from various people. Honestly, I was underwhelmed by the happy hour. The food and drinks were just okay. Living in a city with so many great restaurants and happy hour specials, I\\'d say skip South for happy hour. \\\\n\\\\nI decided to give South another chance.  I\\'m glad that I did. My second visit was for dinner and a jazz performance. Much better experience this time. The entrees were delicious, the service was good, and the music was great. For the true South experience, come for dinner and the music.\", \\'Went during restaurant week. Food was delicious!! My girlfriend wanted to return the next day...lol the waitress was very helpful. I told her I was allergic to red dye, so she gave me a complete rundown of the desert menu and substituted the red velvet cake with a sweet potato cheesecake that was amazing! I wish I could remember her name.\\', \"The place has a good ambience and has good jazz but for someone who is new in town, it doesn\\'t tell you that the jazz area is separate and you cannot change that. We went on a date on Valentine\\'s and there were no good vegetarian options (even after mentioning that in special requests),  couldn\\'t cancel as there was a $45 cancellation fee per person and were not able to sit in the jazz area either. Overall, it was not worth the high price though the hosts were very friendly.\", \"What a great place to eat, kick back and enjoy some live music....\\\\n\\\\nReally nice decor upon walking into the joint.  The Main dining room is split with a small music venue for the jazz groups on another side.  You\\'re greeted by a classy looking bar with a bartender in bow tie and vest. You immediately notice a professional staff and friendly folks.\\\\n\\\\nAs for my first drink, my sazerac could have been better...didn\\'t taste much whiskey in it.  Old fashion was good, but all drinks might have been a little light on their whiskey pours.  Can\\'t complain though, prices were good.  $12 & $10 respectively.\\\\n\\\\nFood was good.....could be better but I wouldn\\'t know because we came on restaurant week so menu items were limited.\\\\n\\\\nCorn bread with soft butter, baked in a mini cask iron skillet was ok, might have tasted like Jiffy box, but the soft butter spread made the dish.  Fried green tomatoes were phenomenal....mayo/sriracha sauce with crab meat maybe?....that made the dish.  Mac n Cheese was really good, but tasted like lasagna because they put a side of marinara.  Fried chicken was really really good.....Extra crispy thin skin with really moist meat inside.  How was this soo good????  Short rib with side of collard greens and small potatoes were also good....collard greens might have been one of the best I\\'ve had.  Desert was assortment of cheesecakes, red velvet and maybe a creme brûlée....Adequate to end the meal.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s makes this place great was the live jazz band and the over all atmosphere.  I\\'ve never been to New Orleans, but they coulda fooled me.\", \"I can\\'t underscore enough how delicious the food is and how wonderful it is to eat while listening to this amazing jazz. Well done.\", \"Live great jazz and blues music, great drinks and nice ambiance. The only thing I don\\'t enjoy is by my own fault of not being open enough to try new dishes is the lack of choices in the menu. But again, my palette is minimally small.

I\\'m also a vegetarian so my view might be bias, just not a lot on their menu for us.\", \"This is a really cool restaurant, very unique to Philadelphia. The happy hour deals are really good, and ambience in the restaurant is nice. They have jazz concerts fairly regularly, but I believe they have a cost. The service was a bit slow the night that we came, but the food was incredible. It\\'s hard to find good southern food up north. I recommend coming here.\", \"I had a great experience....I can\\'t say this enough. I am a southern girl (from Florida) and this reminded me of home...\\\\nThe ambiance was great. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and walked to my table towards the back where the live jazz band was set up (I had made reservations for the live jazz band) The food was great. I had the cornbread and cream cheese honey butter to start, followed by the mac and cheese terrine, then the candied yams, stewed turkey green beans, and the buttermilk fried chicken. The service was outstanding. All of the South staff was very attentive, my drinks were refilled as soon as they were low and the plates were taken away as each course was completed.

I would definitely patron (and recommend) the SOUTH again.\", \"yes, yes and yes. food- amazing; ambiance- beautiful; service- great.

I can\\'t wait to go back again\", \"Great happy hour options - be ready for some good drinks and some fried foods :-)\\\\n\\\\nThere are a bunch of food options on the happy hour menu - it was really easy to make a meal of it. We got the cheese and crackers (farmers cheese, pimento cheese, crackers, and so many pickled things). We also got the flatbread - and this is the only reason South isn\\'t getting 5 stars: the toppings (kale and feta) were delicious, but the flatbread itself was dry and cardboard-like. The shrimp po-boy for $7 was a GREAT deal - big sandwich with lots of fries. The chicken sandwich slider was also delicious, perfect flavors & same with chips. Finally, the crawfish fritters were good, but not as great as the other good things.\\\\n\\\\nDrinks-wise, the happy hour menu boasted 4-5 beers and wines, and then a handful of great cocktails. The Bourbon Punch was sour and sweet (but not overwhelming) and would be great for a hot day. The Sazerac was fresh and tasteful - would totally recommend.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, great ambience & great happy hour deals! Can\\'t wait to go back and listen to some live jazz\", \"I had a great experience. The atmosphere is cool and inviting. Lively and attentive staff that seem to also enjoy and mesh with the vibe. Cocktails were okay, beers are always good and I didn\\'t try the wine.  Although interesting options were available. Show was incredible for a small venue. Acoustic and noise level were on point! Lost a star because the food wasn\\'t as great as I had expected. Do not get me wrong here. The food was GOOD. The sides were a little lack luster and I would\\'ve enjoy my lamb skank to have a bit more flavor. The texture of the skank and beer bribed chicken were amazing just needed more oomph. Would return\", \"We went to South during Sunday (the first day of Restaurant Week) during Philly Restaurant Week. The service was abysmal and disorganized. \\\\n\\\\nWe had a reservation. After being seated, it was 15 minutes before anyone came by to give us menus or inquire about drinks. We then put in a drink order and that was another unfathomable 20 minutes.  Our server was not at fault. She kept going back to the bar for simple drinks (glasses of wine) that were not done by the one bartender on duty while the other bartender tended to 5 patrons at the bar and polished glasses seemingly unaware that the other member of the bar was overwhelmed and/or can\\'t work at a normal pace for a busy Sunday during Restaurant Week. \\\\n\\\\nWe had no napkins or silverware when the corn bread came out. It was dumped (and I do mean dumped) on the table by someone from the kitchen.  It got cold as we waited to silverware and our drinks, and no server in sight  to flag down to get it. When we finally found our server it took another 10 minutes for her to get this to us along with our drinks which were finally done.  \\\\n\\\\nWaiting for second drinks was no better than the first. Dessert never arrived and was only noticed by our server when she came to ask if we were ready for the check we had to ask for our dessert to be boxed to go. It took over 20 minuted for this request to happen. This is all on a LIMITED RESTAURANT WEEK MENU. It\\'s not like the kitchen had ANY OTHER dessert offering that week. \\\\n\\\\nThis experience started at 6:45 on a Sunday.  I pity the people who go there Friday and Saturday of Restaurant Week. We live 3 blocks away. We really wanted to love this experience. We didn\\'t.  We almost always rate a restaurant 4-5 stars.

I\\'ve read prior reviews that they treat their patrons horribly, so I\\'m not too surprised.

Happy hour was great and the kale flat bread was amazing. Second time I came they obviously changed the recipe of the kale flat bread...nowhere near  as good and service was slow. Third time I came for dinner and that\\'s when I realized the food just isn\\'t good. Ordered the fried lobster and grits. On a whem I cut open my fried lobster only to find it was NOT cooked all the way through. Gross. I signaled the waiter who promptly took it back. I was then (without asking) given an appetizer free of charge. The problem, though a nice gesture I would have preferred to have been able to pick what I wanted. I was brought shrimp...I don\\'t eat shrimp. Not to seem ungrateful I thanked the waiter. My lobster came back out (simply dropped back in the deep fryer not a fresh one) and put on top of my now COLD grits.  I took a few bites and determined I was done. Sadly this was the finale of my dads visit to Philadelphia and nobody was happy with their food. Honestly whole meal should have been comped after a lobster comes UNCOOKED. Imagine had I bit into it?? The dish was a $30 waste of money and not worth it at all. Buyer beware. On a positive note live jazz was great and ambiance of the restaurant has never been a problem.. Just sip water and open your ears.\", \"Service was good.. setting and ambiance is good\\\\n\\\\nThe short rib was perfectly cooked and seasoned.. the greens were tart; dont expect your usual greens with smoked turkey, potatoes were good too\\\\n\\\\nThe desert sampler was good\\\\n\\\\nOverall this isn\\'t your typical soul food restaurant so don\\'t expect it to taste like your grandmothers cooking\", \\'I had a really good meal. The rock shrimp poppers were crisp and spicy in a creamy ranch sort of dip drizzled over.  \\\\nI ordered the blackened redfish which came with side of veggies (those were a bit over salted) while the rice w veggie was a bit under salted. Still the blackened fish was perfect. \\\\nMy husband got the vegetarian papardella pasta with mushroom and he really enjoyed that as well. \\\\nNo drinks were ordered. We sat at the chefs counter and It looked like a lively Saturday night. Would like to go back for the jazz parlour\\', \\'My boyfriend insisted we try this place even though it\\\\\\'s a little high brow for me, and it was overall a good experience. We split some hush puppies and fried oysters for the starter, but they were kind of a bust (dry and moderately okay, respectively). My main was the shrimp pappardelle, while he got the lamb shank. Mine was pretty good, though it could have used another 5 or so shrimp. We got a very rich pecan pie for dessert with ice cream on top, and since I don\\\\\\'t love pecans and things that are too sweet, I mostly just went for the ice cream.\\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\\\'t know, this place didn\\\\\\'t exactly \"wow\" either of us, but it wasn\\\\\\'t an awful experience, so this review is more of a 3.5. Maybe we\\\\\\'ll try it again?\\', \"Was finally able to check out South for restaurant week, and overall had a decent experience. \\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere- this place is gorgeous. Seriously, you\\'d never guess how pretty it is inside by looking at it from the outside. There\\'s a restaurant area and a jazz bar which is nice. We were invited to sit in the jazz bar even though we had reserved regular dining - this was at no charge. Typically, I believe there is a fee for sitting in the jazz parlor. \\\\n\\\\nService- stellar. Our waitress was bubbly, attentive, and friendly. \\\\n\\\\nDrinks- I had the strawberry lemonade with cucumber vodka. It was tasty, and ran me $10. \\\\n\\\\nFood- I started with the Cajun deviled eggs - they were definitely tasty, and came with house made chips - didn\\'t really get the pairing. For my main, I had the short rib. The meat itself was tender, but the sauce lacked flavor, and the sides were extremely salty and otherwise bland. Lastly , the desserts were a let down. All of them were reminiscent of baked goods you\\'d buy at the grocery store.\", \"This place was awesome. My boyfriend and I had it on our food bucketlist and decided to try it out one night. Visited to find out that we came on a night they decided to extend restaurant week, so that was nice! It was our first time here, so we were confused about the live music. Thought it would be open to all guests, but you have to make reservations and even sometimes buy tickets to the performance depending on who\\'s performing. Food was delicious.

Don\\\\\\'t get me wrong, for the most part I like their wings, nice size, good flavor and varied assortment of spices or sauces. But it stops there. \\\\nTwo things, 1, they have no \"sense\" to what they do as a sports bar and 2, happy employees make happy customers. Rarely do I see the same servers/bartenders. Makes you wonder. \\\\n\\\\nThe two PJs in the area, Downingtown and Malvern both packed, not a spot in the lot. 2:45 pm, Friday 1st round of March Madness. BWW, 7 empty seats at the smaller bar, three tables occupied. Makes you wonder. \\\\nI do believe BBW has better food than PJs, but it goes further than that, atmosphere and happier employees\\', \"If I could give no stars I would. Just visted this location for lunch. As soon as you walk in, the hostess wasn\\'t that friendly. When asked if we could have a booth she begins to tell me they can\\'t put highchairs at a booth. The way she said it was rude. Once seated our waitress, Destiny came over right away...she took 15mins to bring our drinks out..nothing difficult (tea, pepsi, lemonade) we also order wings as an appetizer. After finally bringing our drinks out the wings were still not out. We ordered our meals and after about 30 mins we got our meals and the wings came out at the same time! We ate, food ok. Wings were dry not enough sauce. Waitress never came to check on us. She disappeared and no where in sight for 20mins! Then She walked past us 4-5 times not once looking at us, asking if we needed anythung or how anything was. Never brought refills either. We cleaned up table and sat waiting and waiting..finally after 15 mins she comes and we ask for checks. We pay. She never told us to have a good day or thank you or anything she just put checks on table and walked away. Really??? HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Not to mention when we were leaving the manager who was on duty was too busy setting up a display table to even ask us how anythimg was and did not even thank us for coming..never said a damn word!

I decided to give them a try, and I\\'m so glad I did.\\\\n\\\\nFirst off, I have a very soft spot for family-owned establishments. The owner greeted me when I first walked in. His wife worked with him and they had two beautiful girls. Very nice family overall.\\\\n\\\\nI was so happy when I found out that they had sfiha. Not many Middle Eastern places serve it, and when they do they are mediocre at best. I also ordered the cheese fatayer which was also stuffed with spinach. And finally for my first meal at Cafe Baladi: a chicken shawarma sandwich with fries!\\\\n\\\\nThe Sfiha: DELICIOUS! It certainly wasn\\'t what I expected in terms of shape since usually Sfiha\\'s are prepared like pizzas (flat dough with meat on top) but this was just as good! I had to hold myself from eating the 2nd piece. My mom would be so upset if she knew I hadn\\'t saved her any.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cheese Fatayer was amazing! I admit I hadn\\'t realized it was also stuffed with spinach until I took a bite. I thought I made a mistake of ordering Spinach Fatayer but the owner assured me that all Cheese Fatayers are also stuffed with spinach, which was literally pure heaven in every bite. Might I add that the spicy mayo served with the fatayer is to die for!\\\\n\\\\nTheir Chicken Shawarma was probably one of the best shawarmas I\\'ve had so far. The chicken was flavorful and had the perfect mixture of spices, and the sandwich itself was toasted to perfection under a panini grill. And of course, the traditional shawarma garlic sauce that was served on the side and placed inside the sandwich was the real deal. It\\'s an art that not many places can perfect. The best part is it reminds me of the shawarmas back home in Syria. I wish I had finished the whole thing, but ended up boxing the other half to eat for breakfast the next day.\\\\n\\\\nAnd let\\'s not forget those delicious homemade fries. I didn\\'t even have to ask and confirm from the owner to know that they were homemade. The Paprika seasoning was a good touch. As any Syria would do, I also dipped them in the garlic sauce :) \\\\n\\\\nAnd did you think I was going to leave that place without trying their Hummus? Though I didn\\'t order it, the owner was generous enough to give me a sample along with some toasted pita. It\\'s A+ Hummus on my book.\\\\n\\\\nOverall this was a great lunch, and I will definitely be back. I\\'m looking forward to trying their other stuff (Kibbeh, Fattoush, Falafel). \\\\n\\\\nI spoke to the owner and his family for a bit and learned that they recently came to the States from the Dominican Republic, where they used to own a similar place. \\\\n\\\\nI wish them all the success! You\\'ll be seeing me very often for lunch!\", \"Really good tasting food. I got the lamb pita and it\\'s a very nice range of flavors and consistency. I can\\'t speak to how authentic it is, but it\\'s good food and I\\'m sure many kids would eat here without issue.\", \"I\\'m not a usual Yelp reviewer but felt the need to do so here.  I stumbled upon Cafe Baladi by chance by being in the shopping center but I am so glad that I did!  Let me start by stating that Lebanese food is my FAVORITE cuisine and since moving to the area 2 years ago, not having a local spot has been a huge point of contention.  \\\\n\\\\nWife and I went there with our 1 year old (he loved their hummus).  We had the mixed shawarma, fattoush salad, and tabbouleh, all were amazing.  We enjoyed it so much that I picked up the next week for ourselves + siblings + parents and everyone agreed that the food was excellent.  And its BYOB!  It\\'s also great chatting with the owners when you are there in person.  I highly recommend Cafe Baladi and expect to go back on the regular.\", \"It was so good that I had to come back again. This time with my fam.\\\\n\\\\nWe decided to try their soup of the day, which was the lentil soup. I don\\'t think describing it as delicious is enough, so let\\'s just say that it earned my Mama\\'s approval. \\\\n\\\\nIn the ultimate shawarma debate, I am more of a chicken than a lamb shawarma kind of gal, but in an effort to try something different, I decided to give their lamb shawarma a try. And It was probably the best lamb shawarma I\\'ve had. The lamb itself was juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly.\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations, Cafe Baladi! You have officially earned my family\\'s approval.\", \\'Stopped in here today for lunch and was blown away by the service and quality of food! Very clean restaurant, authentic flavors, everything home made.  Spoke with the chef and his wife for a little as well, it is family owned and they are new to the states, go check it out!!\\']', '[\\'Decent Japanese food with a good variety of fish.

While the atmosphere isn\\'t anything fancy, and capacity is very limited (four teppanyaki tables and only two chefs), the food will blow you away (and at a crazy value given the quality).  The sushi is magnificent and these folks have mastered sticky rice.  For the entrees, the steak dinner is the winner.  $17 bucks for a great cut cooked perfectly with sides and appetizers included.  BYOB to top it all off.  No one is going to throw food at you, but if your appetites are for great sushi and steaks with bringing your own nice bottle of wine or sake, this place is an absolute treasure.  No fancy bells and whistles, just great food.  Since the space is small, I recommend going on a weeknight for what is effectively a private dining experience.\", \"The restaurant was clean, and that\\'s why they get two stars. Not only is it BYOB, but it is also BYO yum yum sauce. Dine here if you like ginger, teriyaki, and water.\\\\n\\\\nWe were the only customers, which should have given us a clue, but we saw the good reviews and wanted to give this place a chance. Decor is mauve straight out of 1985. We were not offered any drinks other than water. We wanted hibachi, but realized we\\'d be waiting til midnight to gather a group large enough. We ordered from the menu, and thank goodness I noticed that in order to get fried rice we\\'d have to pay 4 bucks more. We asked them to hold the mushrooms, but they must have thought we didn\\'t know the difference between mushrooms and onions, as we had mushrooms galore. And that sticky fried rice in a cup that we had to spoon into our plate was a total disgrace. We asked for yum yum sauce and were told they don\\'t serve that. Guess we should\\'ve hit up the Asian food store before dining here. Don\\'t plan on going back, but if we do, we will bring our own yum yum and alcohol!\", \\'Great place on a Saturday night.

It was not overly packed, there were a few empty tables when we arrived. They were out of a lot of beers and the service could have been better. There was so much miscommunication between the kitchen, the runners and the servers. While our server said a keg tapped, another said the beer was still available. While the server said they ran out of handcut chips and would serve tortilla chips in lieu, we were served handcut chips. I had ordered the quesadilla (which was really good, and supposed to come with chips), but did not come with chips. I had asked the runner for the handcut chips, and he then said they were out, but my friend ordered a burger that had the handcut chips on the plate. Very confusing. They did eventually bring me the handcut chips. I also thought the food was really salty. The burgers were cooked well when ordered medium.\\\\nThe live music was also really good.\\\\nAgain, this place has a lot of potential but there needs to be better communication and less salt.\\', \\'So far the BEST place in Phoenixville.

I loved all the apps we had: the grilled cheese and tostadas.\\', \"I want to start off this review by saying this used to be one of my favorite places.  I have been here many times for happy hours and dinners.  One of my favorite dishes is the chicken pita sandwich.  The staff is always prompt and courteous.  Unfortunately after eating here on 12/21, I came down with a case of food poisoning.  I have never been so sick in my life.  I pretty much could not move for 24 hours and many other symptoms that are too disgusting to post on yelp.   I thought perhaps it was a stomach bug but a coworker who also had the chicken pita was also violently ill in the same time frame that I was. Then I saw these other reviews stating that other people experienced this food poisoning as well.  The rest of my coworkers had the fried chicken sandwich and were fine.  I called today to tell the manager about my horrible experience. I just want to state that I have NEVER called a restaurant to complain before but after reading the other reviews I knew something was wrong.  James was nice and calm, probably because I was as well.  I did not want compensation but do want them to know that something is very wrong if this many people are getting ill.  James explained that most of the staff was sick that week and it could have been a stomach bug.  I\\'m sorry, but that should be a red flag that so many of the staff were sick and what I experienced was NOT a stomach bug. I don\\'t want to take down a local business but the issue must be addressed before more people get sick.  James said that next time I come in to ask for him.  I do appreciate that but it may be a long time until I can trust that this is a safe place to eat.   He also stated these other reviewers were rude when they called (I\\'m sure they were very angry and have every right to be but the manager should not be throwing this back on customers).  I understand this is a touchy subject and you want to defend your business but the cause needs to be determined before more people get sick.

Although not on the menu, they were awesome enough to make one for me and even asked what vegetables I wanted and what I wanted to avoid. This was above and beyond and I\\'m just so appreciative to find a restaurant that will provide foods that are delicious, healthy, and actually good for you. In addition to the green smoothie I also ordered two eggs that were cooked perfectly and mixed fruit that was amazingly good...none of that pre sliced fruit that\\'s been sitting in preservatives.

Food quality varies -- some dishes are good, others ehhh. But I do love the bar.

It was sweet but had an enjoyable punch to it.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered several appetizers- oysters, meatballs, butternut squash pierogis, goat cheese and potato roulade and a cheese plate. Half were stellar and the other half were standard. The meatballs and pierogis were the standouts. There wasn\\'t enough of a variety of cheese in the cheese plate.

Anyway we tried to sit at a table next to the area of a high top and a server very quickly came up to us and told us we couldn\\'t sit there as it was set up for dinner.   I guess they don\\'t want our business as we left.  It was around 2:30 and we would have been finished way before dinner time.  \\\\nOh well, their loss.\", \"I think I ate here about 5 times during a 4 day stay across the street at the Marriott. My boss and I were in town for a conference in the Loews Hotel and ate here a lot since it was so hot that we didn\\'t want to walk very far from both our hotel and the conference venue.\\\\n \\\\nWeekend brunch/breakfast options are pretty limited. You get an option of a handful of a la carte items and then two buffets - a continental and a full buffet. The full buffet was about $40, which is overpriced in my opinion. I opted to do the continental because it was about $18, I believe. They have a nice selection of options - pastries, breads, smoked salmon, prosciutto, cheeses, fruits, and shrimp.\\\\n \\\\nBreakfast options on a weekday are much better - I had their omelet and the steak and eggs. Both were good and I enjoyed them both. Lunch was mediocre. I had their bucatini and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Ragu jar. If you\\'re in either the Marriott or the Loews and need a quick meal, I\\'d suggest only going for breakfast on a weekday.\\\\n \\\\nService was always pretty attentive and everyone working in the restaurant was very nice.\", \"This restaurant was very good. It didn\\'t blow me away. The interior was trendy and modern. The menu has plenty of range but not enough staples to back up all the fancy. Don\\'t get me wrong - I love the fancy, trendy dishes. We ordered a few appetizers. The fried meatballs were amazing! Meat and cheese inside!! Short rib was tender. I ordered the duck for dinner. Cooked to perfection. Tender and flavorful. We ordered 3 desserts because none of us could decide. The latte ice cream that came with the mocha cake was phenomenal. Tasted just like a La Columbe draft latte. Ice cream sandwich was amazing and the finally - the vanilla donut may have been my favorite. I love desserts a lot.\", \"Great Mother\\'s Day brunch all you can eat buffet! Not sure if this is a weekly thing but they should, $40/head is a great deal\", \"The food and service was great. I was highly disappointed that the blueberry crumble pie was not available even though it\\'s highlighted on Yelp. This restaurant sets their menu with seasonal specialties.\", \"We are staying at the hotel above this restaurant so it was easy to get to lol. Made a reservation\\\\nEarlier in the day. Hostess was very nice and remembered our conversation when we came in. Offered us a selection of tables and let us choose. \\\\n\\\\nWater offered is either still or sparkling, refreshed often. Bread was nice and chewy. Butter was soft (really don\\'t like hard, cold butter that\\'s impossible to spread). \\\\n\\\\nHad the $10 Pinot noir. Yuck!  It was sweet. Next had the $17 Pinot noir. Much better. \\\\n\\\\nWe shared the octopus appetizer. It was delicious if a bit small portion wise. We shared the 18 oz NY strip, medium rare. It was delicious. Charred on the outside with great seasonings. Side order Parmesan rosemary fries (no rosemary though) and mixed veggie. \\\\n\\\\nCappuccino to end. And it was very good\\\\nMeal with friendly service. Would return\", \\'My friends and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile,  so restaurant week was the perfect time.  For appetizers I suggest the Hamachi or Taste of Ham.  The potato soup was too bland for me.  For dinner, the roasted Lancaster chicken portion is huge!  One plate could feed a few people.  My other friend got the flat iron steak and finished every last bite!  The steak portion was much smaller than the chicken.  The verlasso salmon was tasty, especially red wine sauce.  For dessert I recommend the apple cobbler over the chocolate cake.\\', \\'Had a great lunch here. Would recommend the flat iron steak. It melts in your mouth and was excellent. Would definitely recommend.\\', \\'Very nice place in the loews hotel. We had reservations for 915 but arrived super early but they still seated us.  Nice menus all around from cocktails to sides. We had the New York strip that they cut off the bone for us. Nice med well and flavors.  Prices are reasonable and service snappy. A great place to have a nice cocktail, wine and steak.\\', \\'Empty Bar at 5:45 and No Happy Hour Specials..\\\\nNo thanks, plenty of other options.  Bar service was\\\\nUnfriendly and poor considering the place was empty\\', \\'Great steak  (filet) and fingerling potatoes along with some brussel sprouts. Wow was it great. Our waiter Kirk was great. He was always nearby when we needed water or another drink. I had a sample of the parm fries and they were very flavorful. If you are in Philly stop by for a steak as they are awesome.\\', \\'We had lunch here during restaurant week, but it wasn\\\\\\'t crowded so I don\\\\\\'t believe that\\\\\\'s a valid excuse. The restaurant week menu was uninspired, but, we saw the menu beforehand so that\\\\\\'s neither here nor there. Communication is not their specialty. I made it clear that I was dairy free and asked if they could accommodate it. No problem. Except when I got my salmon salad, it was covered with something that looked suspiciously like dairy...  I told the server and he said \"oh, I did tell them, but do you want me to check?\"  Yes, that would be nice...  it was yogurt so I got a new one but no thanks to the staff. It took a while to get my cocktail and weren\\\\\\'t sure who our server was. To be clear, organization is not great here which isn\\\\\\'t the fault of the server, but of management so don\\\\\\'t blame the messenger!  We also asked for olive oil with the bread and they just brought more bread. Again, communication not their strong suit. Took away knives and forks without replacing and left the bread on the table with the dessert. Jesus. I did ask for a message to be written on my husband\\\\\\'s cake - which they managed to pull off- and that\\\\\\'s the only reason for the additional star.\\', \"A little gem. Attentive, intelligent, charming staff, well-chosen menu, outstanding Negronis. You won\\'t regret dining here.\", \"Great tasting food that\\'s made quickly. Waitstaff is friendly and polite. There is ample seating at this location inside the Lowe\\'s hotel building.\", \\'After writing this review, the manager reached out to me trying to \"make things right\" as this isn\\\\\\'t a reflection of their business.  Interestingly, after responding, I never heard back from him- seems like lack of communication/ customer service is part of the culture here-\\', \"Waited about 10 minutes on a table, no one greeted or assisted me, left and went elsewhere to eat.  Terry are lucky to have the location, otherwise they\\'d be out of business very soon...\", \"Stopped in tonight with some friends. Had walked by before and it looked inviting so we gave it a try.  We were quickly seated and attended to.  The menu is limited and way overpriced. I understand it\\'s centercity and next to the Loews but now I can see why we found a seat so quickly. I ordered scallops and they were ok - but only ok. Maybe slightly overcooked as turning rubbery but not bad.  The accompanying corn was tasty but nothing to write home about.  I also tried some of the meatball appetizer - pretty mediocre too. In fact we left one altogether in spite of the fact I was still hungry and picked up a quick burger on the way home.  I don\\'t mind paying for quality - but not mediocrity.  I think it\\'s just a tourist trap and few locals will make it a frequent stop.\", \\'Nice spot for food, drink, and fun.   Place was hopping on a Sunday night. \\\\nWent with the whole fish, which was served in a skillet with veggies.   Very flavorful.    \\\\nOthers had steak and scallops.  \\\\nThe biggest hits were the appetizers, including burrata, the cheese plate, and the crispy meatballs.\\', \"Horrible service tried to kick us out of dinning room when many tables were open with no one waiting because we just wanted drinks and dessert :/ wouldn\\'t come here again.\", \"I\\'ve been wanting to try Bank & Bourbon for awhile and restaurant week was the perfect time to do so.  We were able to make a last minute reservation for two on a Monday night to test out their 3 course menu. \\\\n\\\\nWe were a little early so we sat at the bar and each got a drink. Their drink menu is extensive with the biggest list of whiskey/bourbon/scotch I\\'ve ever seen.  I prefer wine and had one of their cabernets which I really enjoyed. \\\\n\\\\nThe wait staff was super efficient and knowledgable on the menu offerings, we were brought bread and butter that was delish. For starters I had their potato soup-this was the least exciting part of my meal.  The flavor was extremely lacking, but it had a good texture and crouton that came in it was enjoyable.  For my main I had the half of chicken with fingerling potatoes and some greens. Holy portions.  I couldn\\'t believe the amount of food on my plate, I was able to share with my boyfriend who had the steak that was a much smaller portion, and have left overs for the next day.  As someone who rarely orders chicken out I was really pleased with how well the chicken was cooked and how delicious the sauce that came on it was.  The potatoes were cooked to a crispy perfection.  Despite being stuffed after my entree, the dessert came out and I couldn\\'t get enough.  Their apple cobbler is something I would order over and over again.  \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m really glad I was able to try them during restaurant week, and am interested in trying more things off of their extensive menu.\", \\'My husband and I attended Brunch this past Sunday afternoon, I\\\\\\'m a firm believer that when hospitality is done right it makes your experience all the better and they\\\\\\'ve done it here from start to finish, when we valet\\\\\\'d the car the attendant was courteous and quick, even made sure to guide us to the restaurant from the garage without us asking.  Each employee we passed made eye contact and greeted us on our walk, that\\\\\\'s almost unseen these days but they\\\\\\'re clearly accepting and reciprocating the culture here! at the Host stand she greeted us with a big smile, and although she had to take a call, she was quick to apologize for the interruption, I hate it when that is missed, I really do, it screams \"you\\\\\\'re invisible!\" she took us to our table where we were offered drinks immediately, now to the food, holy smokes it was GOOD! there was a really nice selection of made to order omelettes, prime rib, breakfast meats, potatoes, pancakes, shrimp, salads, cheese and lots of sweet treats! I usually go big when I see a full buffet like this but I paced myself and got a good taste of many of the selections, it was tasty folks! take my word for it.  Our server was lovely and very attentive by keeping a close eye on whether we wanted more drinks, even at the end of our meal when we were the last seated in our section, the back waiter indulged in friendly conversation as opposed to giving us an evil eye for still being there.  I\\\\\\'ll be back and that\\\\\\'s for sure, the food  was great, the service was great and the service was right on point!\\', \"We went here a couple of times during our weekend stay. It was very convenient for us from the hotel. The decor and atmosphere is very chill but it does get crowded. We were unable to secure a table as a walk in so we ate in the bar. It turned out fine but just be warned you\\'ll need a reservation if you need a table.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was pretty good I especially enjoyed they duck. The staff was great and attentive. It isn\\'t cheap but then you wouldn\\'t expect it to be given the location and the setting.\", \"Bank & Bourbon is an above-average hotel bar in the downtown Philadelphia Loews Hotel in the historic Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) building. The building and setting may be iconic, but it was some late-night drinks and American fare which make me a fan.\\\\n\\\\nThe Taste of Ham board was a triple taste of yum featuring Hamery, Benton\\'s Ham, and Creminelli Prosciutto. The meats may change with the season, but this trio was hamtastic. Other yummy bar menu discoveries were a Grilled Octopus with Fingerling Potatoes and Cherry Pepper Relish plus a sizzling plate of Chive-roasted Local Mushrooms.\\\\n\\\\nAn even more bankable discovery was a Fist Full of Dollars cocktail laced with Maker\\'s Mark. If you like bourbon, this is the bar for you in Philadelphia. If you like sweet bourbon cocktails, then this is the cocktail to order.\\\\n\\\\nEven if you aren\\'t staying at the Loews Hotel, Bank & Bourbon gives plenty of reasons to visit and see the historic 1920\\'s building with some above-average food and drinks.\", \\'The most attentive and friendly staff from bartender to food runners to bussing staff. Food is great and the fixed a mistake on a flash.  First time and we will be back. Plus a Turley by the glass.\\', \"Went there for apps, and a glass of wine told our server that we just came in for such, but kept pushing and pushing for dinner to the point we felt uncomfortable. He was trying to push us to buy a bottle of wine even though I told him we are both just having one glass. Totally ruined our experience there. I understand trying to upsell as being in sales myself but I don\\'t think I\\'ll return due to the pushiness of the server.\", \"This cool place is located in the Philly Loews on Market Street. I was staying here for a work training and literally walked through the lounge area of this restaurant daily. \\\\n\\\\nOn the evening of Thursday 07/19/18, around 8:50 PM I sat on the hotel side in the lobby part where it was comfy chairs and charging dock tables. \\\\n\\\\nIt only took the waitress, Sorry I forgot her name, about 2 minutes to come over and welcome me and take my drink order and hand me a menu. I just came from eating and drinks at Warmdaddy\\'s a little earlier so I just wanted dessert. \\\\n\\\\nI decided on the Chocolate Mocha Cake served with a latte ice cream and chocolate covered crunch cookie. And boy oh boy was it good. I mean really good. The cake was moist and fresh and rich. The ice cream was the perfect consistency and the right amount of coffee flavor. I was impressed and I ate it all. Lol \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll be back here next summer and I\\'ll definitely try a meal. Nice place.\", \"Stopped in for dinner and sat at the bar.  Very friendly staff gave me a menu and glass of water pretty quick.  I ordered the Dry Aged Burger which comes with poblano peppers, cheddar cheese and a green herb sauce with a side of fries. This was one of the best burgers I\\'ve had in a long time.  Hope it stays on the Menu for they next time I\\'m in Philly.\", \\'We had made a reservation for lunch on Sunday. When we arrived we were informed that they only do brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Because we had traveled to meet for lunch, we decided to stay. The food served was lukewarm. There was no-one behind the station to make either eggs or omelette. this was between 12:00 and 1:00. I wish we had been informed when we made our reservation that brunch was the only meal available.\\', \"I have been wanting to try this place for some time and being that it\\'s restaurant week I decided to go here for a night out. The decor and the feel of the restaurant inside was very nice. They easily have over 100 different bourbons and whiskeys to chose from, as well as an extensive wine list. They give you the option of still or sparking water when you sit down, which I enjoyed. The bread that they give you when you sit down is phenomenal. I wish I had more of it. \\\\n\\\\nThe food:\\\\nSince we did restaurant week we both had 3 courses. My first course was the Hamachi, which is something I\\'ve never had before. It was raw fish, apples, radish and other ingredients. It was very flavorful and the perfect amount to eat before an entree. I would definitely eat it again. \\\\n\\\\nMy main course was the flat iron steak which was cooked exquisitely. It had a lot of flavor and the spinach purée on the side was tasteful as well. \\\\n\\\\nFor dessert I had the German chocolate cake. It was very rich and had a lot of coconut to it. I\\'m not the biggest fan of coconut but I decided to give it a try. With that in mind, I still enjoyed the cake. \\\\n\\\\nI definitely want to come back and dine here again to try more of their food. We both really enjoyed our dinner and left satisfied.\"]',\n",
       "  '[\"I have been hyping PJ\\'s wings up for a few months to a couple co-workers who have never been. We finally go on wing night and now the wings are so small?! Maybe due to Hurricane Florence or maybe PJ\\'s is finally turning into a sell-out franchise/chain. I don\\'t know. Anyway, wings used to be the best and large. Now it\\'s a rip-off. $4 copper lagers are the only good thing going on there apparently.\", \"Very friendly staff - on it - we had a couple of beers and took wings home with us.  So we really didn\\'t dine in.  But the place was hopping and the food looked good.  So back to the wings. We had them baked - original flavor.  They were the bomb for a late night snack.  My only issue:  three - 3 - three small pieces of celery for ten wings.  Was hoping for a little more.  Decent beer selection.  Wish I lived close by.\", \"Atmosphere: Typical sports bar/pub feel. Busy, noisy, and lots of commotion. There\\'s a nice patio with plenty of outdoor seating as well. We tried our hand at music trivia while we ate - it takes place every Thursday evening. \\\\n\\\\nService: Service was average on a busy Thursday night. Our waitress was very kind but she was hard to flag down at times as she was quite busy. \\\\n\\\\nFood: Wide variety of food with a good mix of typical pub fare and more unique items. We started with the wicked chicken nachos with the sweet chili sauce - so yummy! My French onion burger and my PJ\\'s famous fries (fries seasoned with Old Bay and served with American cheese sauce) were also very delicious. Everyone was very pleased with their meal!\\\\n\\\\nFinal Thoughts: You really can\\'t go wrong with this place. There\\'s something on the menu for just about everyone. If you\\'re looking for fun pub fare, I recommend this place.\", \\'Popped in here after a rehearsal dinner on a Thursday night for some drinks. It was pretty packed which was surprising (I guess NFL games?). My friends and I stood at the end of the bar and ordered some beers. The drafts were HUGE! I actually liked this PJs location better than the Downingtown location.\\', \"I came here on NYD and was out in the patio area as that was the only seating available at the time. The hostess said that the Patio will have heat on. I said ok as I was with my 5 year old son at the time and wanted to go somewhere with a kids menu on NYD. I put in my order and had a seat and waited for about 35-40 min to get food. I just had orders of wings and my son had cheeseburger sliders. I took off my jacket and was starting to feel cold and saw that the heater above us was shut off. My son was feeling the same way. Our table was in the corner next to the window so it was cooler in that area. Apparently a group who was seated after us complained about the heat so that was shut off. The waitress said because they want it shut off that we will turn it on briefly. She turned it on and it was fine and then 5 min later it shut off again because the other table complained again. I asked if we can sit somewhere else and told her that\\'s not fair. My question is why should we move? We were there first  got our order after the other group and I had a kid to manage as the other group was a bunch of adults. I was so annoyed by the service that day. They moved us to the bar.  If you decide to come here and patio is the only option and if you get cold request an inside seat or go elsewhere.  If they are going to turn off the heaters in the winter and have people sit out there..that\\'s not cool. The waitress didn\\'t care about doing the right thing..she was concerned about losing her table in a transfer.\", \"Have been here multiple times and usually get a burger which are very good.  Today it was a little chilly and comfort food seemed the way to go. Ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and a bowl of chili.   Both were excellent.  Grilled cheese was on Texas toast and had a decent amount of bacon.  Chili was best I\\'ve had locally.  Now it was a little spicy for me but I like mild so for people that like spicy you\\'ll be fine.  Taste was great though.  Wife opted for fish tacos and says they are the best in the area.  Service was efficient.\", \\'Great night at the pub.  Half price wings and great entrees. Good bar food and Attentive service.\\', \\'PJs is a great Always a good place to watch your favorite sporting events. The selection of different types of beer is outstanding. The food is very good as well as the service.\\', \"Game day bar. Great for what you\\'d expect. Tvs on all walls and surrounding the bar. Always has a good beer selection that suits any beer drinker needs. Wings are delicious and must get them extra crispy. Also fish tacos, pjs fries, chili and burgers never disappoint. But I do not like the brioche bun for the burgers and sub out for another without issue.\", \"Went back a few more times recently. Much better food beyond chicken wings.  Usually we know better to order anything else.  Had a good meal twice this month. Definitely better than before. Friendly bartenders. If you like sports, you\\'ll love this place. I can\\'t even count how many tvs are in this restaurant.  Fun atmosphere for sports.\", \\'If you haven\\\\\\'t been to a sports bar before, P.J. Whelihan\\\\\\'s would be a great introduction to the scene.\\\\nThe place is had an expansive central bar which hosts daily beer specials sure to fit your drinking budget.\\\\nAlso great is the menu which has an expansive variety of the types of sandwiches, sides, and appetizers which your husband or child will be sure to dive at. I had the \"insert kitschy qualifier\" nachos and they were great. Not amazing, but about theta you would expect coming from a highway sports bar. \\\\nBe forewarned, as is typical of many sports bars this is definitely a guys bar. I felt a bit out of place as a born after \\\\\\'83 female. And I don\\\\\\'t mean to be snide. But I wouldn\\\\\\'t recommend this to any of my single female friends.\\']',\n",
       "  '[\"Unfortunately this Dunkin is pretty inconsistant with their drinks. I go to this location about two too three times a week.

The only recommendation I will provide is if you don\\'t have to go in the mornings, I feel that maid to late afternoon is not as hectic and the service is much nicer than morning due to rush and line in the drive thru.  I changed my lunch time just because of the service from 12 to 1pm.  So any time after 1-2pm will be ideal.  Work meetings I love to schedule between 3-5pm just before rush time and end of my shift.  I also recommend service is much nicer in afternoon than in morning. Love DD though.\", \"The lady at the counter messed up my order. I asked for a frozen  coffe not hot coffee and she told me i didn\\'t say that. I know i said that and asked my friend did i say that and he said yes.

The parking lot isn\\'t the best, it is very small and cramped. I would reccomend parking behind the buildings in the shopping center and come in through the double doors past the Photo Drivers License Center, as they have more spots in the back. Entering/exiting onto Main Street can also be a pain as it is a crowded part of it and there is no light or stop sign.That aside it isn\\'t a bad store itself, but the location off Main Street, parking lot and some employees really bring it down.\"]',\n",
